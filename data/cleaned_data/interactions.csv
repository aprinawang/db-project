1237233,240311,2009-04-13,5,"This bread pudding tastes just like the ones served on Disney Property.  The Vanilla Sauce (Creme Anglaise) is essential to complete the dish.  

A few tips to help make the dessert great!!  

- Let white bread get stale for about a day or so to help absorb the egg mixture.  
- Cut of the crusts of the bread (at least half the loaf) to keep the pudding more smooth and less chewy.  
- I also added a tsp of vanilla to the egg mixture which enhanced the flavor as well!!"
424680,400243,2009-12-29,5,"What a fast, easy & interesting way to make a tasty sorbet! Making this recipe in my heavy-duty blender was a breeze! I look forward to trying it again with a combo of fruits! [Made & reviewed in the PRMR Holiday Special as a thank you for one of the new players!]"
1544208,208179,2010-04-16,5,I have made a recipe just like this for years. The cream cheese route sounds excellent. This recipe is also very good on a chocolate cake. My mother makes it with a white milk cake that she has cut in half a spread with raspberry jam. She then uses this icing and sprinkles it with mini chocolate chips.
1612775,201750,2010-05-09,5,"This was great, thank you!  I have an electric stove so it ended up taking me at least 25 min. for the dressing to reduce (about the same as the recipe, but some warned it takes less).  This was really sweet, but great!"
431813,201750,2007-04-26,4,"This was really nice.  I would suggest watching the cooking time.  I might be my gas range, but I cooked it about 8 minutes, and if it had gone on any longer, we would have had balsamic strawberry jam on our salads!  Really tasty though.  Thanks!"
353491,201750,2007-05-14,4,"We were happy to find this recipe.
So different. 
The original version is nice but we tweaked it a bit.
We used frozen sweetened strawberries, omitted the sugar and added a Tbsp or so of honey and a @ 1 tsp. roasted sesame oil.
So good."
424680,201750,2008-04-18,5,"Know I have a sweet tooth, so guess that's why I like this dressing so very much! Followed the recipe right through, & the dressing was finished cooking right at 10 minutes! A very tasty salad topping! Thanks for the recipe! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this Spring's Pick-A-Chef]"
867184,201750,2008-06-19,5,It's excellent. I like just sipping it at times. This is the first salad dressing that I'm willing to drench my salad in.
2132065,201750,2012-06-16,5,"Wow, this is a great dressing.  I substituted fresh oregano for the parsley and used half splenda and half sugar.  Made an awesome salad adding feta cheese and diced fresh strawberries to lettuce from our garden.  Grilled chicken breast would also make a very nice addition.  I give it an A!"
590105,170981,2008-04-19,5,This was really good and my 1yo son drank his right up!  So thanks!  It's hard to figure out what he'll eat.  We'll have this again!  Reviewed for Healthy Choices ABC Tag.
104295,170981,2008-05-28,4,"I made, basically, a hafl of this smoothie.  I liked it very much but couldn't get the kids to drink more than a sip.  That said, I thought it was a tasty way to get lots of fiber and nutrients.  Thanks."
424680,170981,2010-03-04,5,"GREAT, GREAT COMBO OF FLAVORS here! I'd made a mashed carrot side, so reserved 1/2 a cup to include in this recipe! I made sure everything was well chilled, & the banana frozen), when I put this beverage together! Definitely a keeper of a recipe ~ Thanks for sharing it!

855802,144841,2008-06-08,0,This is incredibly easy to make and tastes delicious!  Dianne from VA
68884,144841,2010-05-06,5,"Delicious, delicious, delicious!!
My DH â€” not a baker â€” wanted this cake after seeing it in the May 2010 Southern Living. He decided to make it himself, and it is surprisingly divine. Homey, dense, buttery, with a slightly crunchy exterior. We topped with a bit of powdered sugar and paired the slices with fresh, sliced strawberries. Heavenly."
2710499,310570,2013-02-25,5,great recipe - very much like the real thing from back home in Montenegro!
563669,310570,2009-05-05,4,I have been looking for a cheese burek (or burek sa sir) recipe since I visited Bosnia and fell in love with them.  Thank you so much for posting this-- it sounds exactly like I remember and I cannot wait to try it!
1593428,310570,2011-07-01,5,this was so yummy and not to difficult to make. thanks for a great recipe!
2000743062,310570,2016-11-12,4,"Very nice recipe, but missing a few things for me. It needs a pinch of allspice in my opinion, a hint of paprika and a small squeeze of lemon. And, of course, spinach. To me Bosnian cheese B&ouml;rek is always with spinach. Just makes it so much better"
168462,145473,2005-11-22,5,This was a very good pie. I used the cream cheese option in the potatoes but next time to cut down on calories I will probably leave it out. I used a total of 2lb. of gr. beef and added a beef boullion cube to the mixture and left out the added salt. I also added a second boullion cube to the gravy for flavour. This was a very good recipe and easy to make. Thanks for the recipe. 
169969,145473,2006-07-06,5,This is a 5 for quick and easy! A definite stick to your ribs meal that my meat-N-potatoes DH2B loves! I used half ground beef and half cut up steak. This recipe was a life saver as the other meal I had planned had some problems and I needed something quick and yummy! thanks so much for posting!
88099,145473,2006-07-12,5,"OMG thanks so much for the quick and easy recipe.  I made this last night for my sister's family and everyone loved it.  I did use the vegetable broth in place of the cream, but other than that made as directed.  Thanks so much"
222139,145473,2006-07-13,5,Made this for dinner.  Used chicken broth in ours and  I through in some corn in ours.  Very easy to make. The family totaly enjoyed this.  Great also the second day for lunch. 
340576,145473,2006-10-29,5,"Wow, what an easy recipe! I was out of carrots so I added parsnips (peeled & sliced). Also added a drained can of corn for color. It was such a fast, simple meal to put together, and tasted so good that my kids didn't even complain about the veggies. A keeper!"
324621,145473,2007-05-11,3,"Not too terribly impressed with this one. It was okay, but I found it to be a bit bland. And although not very complicated to put together it was a bit time consuming between chopping the veggies and then tending to 3 pans cooking simultaneously on the stove. It was okay but just not something I think I will make again. Oh, and one more thing, I think some cheese would really help this dish out!"
335606,145473,2007-05-21,3,"This recipe was okay.  The first time I've made or had shepherd's pie.  I wasn't too impressed - kinda bland and boring.  I think I'll try a different recipe next time.  And this one would be easier just to use packaged gravy and instant potatoes and frozen veggies.  If I did that, it might be worth it.  But for all that work I just wasn't too impressed.  Thanks anyway, Rachel Ray!"
855621,145473,2011-04-28,5,"This was really good.  Instead of the mashed potatoes listed in the recipe, I topped the pie with leftover Colcannon (Recipe #285431) (mashed potatoes & cabbage), which I think made it even better.  The kids asked for it again - and even my husband, who usually thinks ""comfort food"" means ""bland"", thought this tasted great.  The worcestershire sauce was a great addition to the flavor."
557649,474258,2012-02-16,5,"Good and Plenty is one of the BEST Amish Restaurants in the Lancaster area.  And this is one of my FAVORITE dishes there.  I was born and raised in Gettysburg, PA, and went there many times.  This is an extremely easy recipe and GOOD recipe for its simplicity, like the Amish lifestyle.  I also do this with peeled, quartered potatoes too.  Browned Butter Potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe and the memories!"
219942,474258,2012-02-16,5,"You haven't lived until you've eaten browned butter noodles! I take the butter just to a medium brown color, and it smells so yummy and ""nutty!"" Fabulous!"
364211,474258,2012-02-16,5,"I knew I had to try this, after seeing it newly posted today.  So easy and simply GOOD!  Thanks so very much for sharing Bekah Balmer."
1365025,474258,2012-02-22,5,Had this for lunch today and was quite surprised how good it was. I eat a lot of buttered noodles but never heard of browning the butter. I will try this again now and then. Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag game.
369715,474258,2012-03-05,0,I'm not giving this stars because I am not sure if I did something wrong. I followed the recipe as written but we did not like the taste of these. We like buttered noodles but to us the browned butter didn't taste right to us. Not sure if it was the butter I used or what.
17803,474258,2012-11-06,4,"Oops, I browned the first batch of butter way to much and had to throw it out.  I did not turn the heat up as high the second time.  Just as it started to brown I took it off the heat.  I know I'd be changing the recipe a lot but I would like to add some garlic to the butter next time.   Made for Fall PAC 2012"
4439,474258,2012-11-09,5,"DH and I love this recipe. We used to make it all the time when we lived in Florida with Baked Chicken and steamed green beans. I have actually made the recipe with Gnocchi and it was great with the Gnocchi, too."
346514,474258,2013-03-18,5,"Delicious, easy. Thanks!"
330395,474258,2014-06-13,5,"Too, too easy. Love it! I had never thought of browning the butter first. Really adore the nuttiness it adds to the overall flavor. I also throw in a load of minced garlic (I don&#039;t measure, just a few heaping spoonfuls) when the butter&#039;s about halfway there so the garlic can brown a bit and flavor meld with the butter. Yum!"
450004,344420,2009-02-15,3,"This was tasty, but I felt it was lacking in something..not sure what.  I was makining this to take to work this morning, so I had no time to paly around with it.  Also, I think it was maybe a bit runny, but that was my fault for adding too much cream I think.  I think the best measurement for this, would be 2 TB of cream and 2 TB salsa, for each avocado.  I served it witha  French Stck, which I had sliced thinly and toasted in the oven."
1097211,344420,2009-04-28,0,"Sour cream in guacamole?  I grew up on Tex-Mex and we just use avocados, lime (or lemon) juice, chopped tomatoes, and chopped onion.  You can easily add heat with Tabasco or jalapenos.  Also, cilantro (if it floats your boat)."
163986,302815,2008-05-09,5,"I will rate this without making it because I have been making this for years.  Both my granddaughters love it.  Every time my youngest granddaughter is here for lunch, she asks for it.  I use garlic salt or garlic powder in place of the fresh garlic because it is easier when doing lunch but the fresh garlic is out of this world.  This dish has wonderful flavor and it is soooo easy."
361931,302815,2008-07-23,5,"Very good -- very easy!!  Used rotini pasta, and extra garlic and cheese (just because I love garlic and cheese!).  DS had already eaten his dinner, but kept begging me for bites of mine -- I have taught him well!!  Three years old and a garlic/pasta/cheese lover :)  THANKS!!!"
212609,302815,2008-12-05,5,"This is a good example of the fact that you don't need alot of fancy ingredients and hours slaving over a hot stove to produce something that is satisfying and flavoursome.
Delicious!!"
369715,302815,2008-12-26,4,"This was a good, easy side dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written. We all enjoyed this."
169430,302815,2009-01-15,5,"I used lemon pepper pasta for this and it was a simple and simply delicious way to do pasta (even if your not in a hurry). The slice of ham and carrots were the supporting players for the pasta. I used a tsp of a ""healthier fat"" margarine for 1 serving and let the parm and garlic shine. Made for Gimme 5 game."
537937,302815,2009-02-23,5,"MMmmmmm this went together for me in no time.  I love side dishes like this that are easy with few ingredients but yet get high remarks from the fam.  This is a real keeper Lainey!~
Made for ZaarStars."
923645,302815,2009-03-25,4,"It was good...but I felt that it was a bit bland. Therefore, I added red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and a bit of cheddar cheese...yummm!"
954556,302815,2010-11-30,5,"I make this all the time and enjoy it every time!  I love using fresh shredded Parmesan cheese, and not the stuff in the green can.  It does make a difference in the taste."
1443660,302815,2012-12-27,4,"Very good and simple....you can spice it up a little and make it more of a meal by adding oregano, parsely, fresh ground pepper, and garlic salt to the butter and fresh garlic. Add cooked pasta to spiced melted butter stir to coat in skillet and then add ground cooked italian sausage, and cook until hot.  I also add 1 beated raw egg and stir in to past mixture and cook for an addidional minute.   Add parmesian cheese after pasta is on the plate.   Great for Lent by adding mushrooms instead of the italian sausage."
2000112027,302815,2015-04-03,5,"This recipe is super simple and SO yummy. My boyfriend and I had a nice, candlelit dinner and he LOVED IT. I&#039;m a horrible cook, but I definitely nailed this one. SUPER YUMMY."
37779,302815,2015-05-25,5,"So easy and exactly what I was looking for to satisfy my pasta craving. No changes, perfect as written. Thanks."
2001985253,525818,2018-02-11,3,"I liked the cookies, but i added a little bit of flour, and they were not as good as another recipe I tried"
2002263931,298874,2018-09-02,5,Must try! You'll never go buy a packaged or can gravy again!!!! ??????
254614,153800,2006-03-09,5,"This  is the greatest tomato soup ever. Make sure you chop the onions very fine. If you reheat, make sure it is on half power in microwave because you don't want the cream to curdle. "
124249,153800,2006-04-05,5,"I can see why your family craves this soup. It is delicious. It is also easy to prepare. Tasted just as good the second day. 

Thanks Krsi Sue.

324390,153800,2007-09-17,5,"Easy, easy, easy, and oh so good! This is a real family pleaser. I served it with some sandwiches and felt like I was spoiling myself! Next time I might try it with some non-fat half and half to save on some calories - but I'm not sure I want to mess with a good thing. It made about 5 servings. Made for PAC 2007."
137081,153800,2007-09-19,5,Thank you so much for this recipe! I moved to Montana almost two years ago and six months ago they shut down all of the 4B's restaurants. My family raves about this recipe and is so excited when I make it. Thanks for the comfort food!!!
373178,153800,2007-12-10,5,I loved this recipe!! The only thing I change is I use veggie broth instead of chicken. I also like using my hand blender at the end to make it extra creamy. Thank you!!
703233,153800,2007-12-25,5,"Growing up in Montana, we always stopped at 4B's in Miles City for their tomato soup.  This is a great recipe - we made it for our Christmas Eve dinner.  What a hit!  Thank you so much!!"
1175134,153800,2009-02-18,5,"Born and raised in Montana, I recently moved away, and this is the best homesick cure I have found!  Thank You!  Taste just like it's supposed to.  Perfect."
808027,153800,2009-04-12,3,"Too sweet for us.  Didn't really care for this one, thanks."
114716,153800,2009-07-26,0,"This is the ORIGINAL recipe, I just loveeeee it.  My son came home with their new recipe using chicken base, cream and coffee mate, it doesn't curddle as easy with the coffee mate."
225096,153800,2010-02-26,0,"This is exactly what I was looking for!  On the menu for the weekend and I like the addition of the baking soda which I had a little old Italian lady tell me helps cut the acidity of the tomatoes and ""sweetens"" the dish a bit."
384657,153800,2010-02-26,5,"We really liked this.  I used fat free half and half instead of the cream to make it a tad healthier and it still tasted great.  Oh, and I also put it through the blender at the end, so my toddlers would eat it.  :) Thanks for posting."
696196,153800,2010-11-23,5,How I've missed 4B's cream of tomato - the ULTIMATE in comfort food.  Thank you so much for posting this!
294000,153800,2011-01-20,4,"This is an excellent and easy soup to make. I would probably cut sugar in half next time or even omit as it was a little sweet for my taste. I didn't simmer very long as I was in a hurry. Used fat free half and half in place of cream and warmed it in microwave instead of double boiler (again, in a hurry). I used a hand blender on the tomatoes before adding the half and half. Also added some basil and pepper and a little salt. My family, including a 2-year-old, devoured it. Thanks!"
1827731,153800,2011-02-13,5,"Simple and delicious, even with the healthier modifications suggested by other commenters. Deviating from the recipe I threw in some coriander at the end - if you enjoy coriander (I know its contentious), it goes VERY well in this soup."
1732980,153800,2011-04-23,0,"This is the same recipe I used to have that I got from 4B's years ago, but I lost mine. I am very thankful to have it again. Thanks so much. I really miss 4B's Restaurants and this soup."
714468,153800,2011-05-10,4,"I loved this soup, but my husband likes Campbell's tomato soup better.  I used my immersion blender to get it really creamy.  I added in a bit of salt and pepper and next time I make it I think I'll try basil as well.  This was super easy so I'll definitely make again and halve the recipe for just myself and my daughter.  Maybe it was because I simmered it a little longer, but I got more like 4 or 5 servings, not 8."
598608,153800,2011-08-03,5,Wonderful soup and I don't like tomato soup!  I blended the soup b4 adding cream as I like I smooth not chunky. I think I may reduce the sugar next time or maybe try it one time with splendor as hubby's is diabetic.
168462,153800,2011-08-05,5,Oh my this is good and so easy to make. I did add an extra Knorr chicken cube and I used homemade rice milk in place of the cream. My daughter who is a vegetarian loved this soup and asked me if I would make it again tomorrow. I followed another reviewers advice and pureed the soup. It was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.
789516,153800,2011-11-10,5,Loved the simplicity of the ingredients.  It was really good!
1683306,153800,2012-03-02,0,This is an excellent soup!!!!! I also pureed the tomatoes before adding the cream as well as adding a bag of spinach with large stems removed (simmer until tender) and 8oz of feta cheese....was absolutely amazing.
111306,153800,2012-04-16,1,Not sure where I went wrong :( Followed direction and it curdled both times I made it.
326176,153800,2017-01-01,5,now that most of the 4B's have closed near us I make this all the time. sometimes I make it with everything but the cream and can it as a soup concentrate. then I can just add the cream later when we're ready to eat it. I usually just leave the sugar out but that's to my taste.
2001955966,153800,2018-01-27,0,We have 4bs back in missoula. Your recipe is close but your missing an ingredient. Regarding It curdling we cook ours at 4bs in a double boiler set up.
6258,16451,2003-05-16,5,"Bergy, thanks for posting a great tasting recipe.  I made the recipe as you directed, and then I added 1 green onion, just for another layer of flavor.  Really, you could play around with different flavors for these mushrooms, like using a chipotle instead of a jalapeño.  This is definately a keeper.  Thanks! 
:-)  "
75497,16451,2005-08-24,5,"These were delicious!  I wasn't sure how broiled cottage cheese would taste, but, it turned out to just be a creamy background to the jalapeno.  I used Miss Annie's suggestion and added some chopped green onion, also.  I'll definitely be making these again, especially since they're only 1.1 WW point per serving.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
289357,16451,2007-09-30,4,"These were really good, but no matter how long I seemed to cook them they never really browned on top (the cheese just got a littly runny).  No matter - they were wonderful!  I added a lot more jalepeno and garlic, and they were still great.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!"
600643,16451,2007-10-02,4,"They were way too spicy for my family and me, so next time I'll use just one clove of garlic and maybe 1/3 cup of cottage cheese, but they were otherwise fantastic!"
46660,16451,2007-10-11,3,"I wasn't really 'over the moon' for these.  I mean, I liked them enough, but they definitely tasted ""lowfat.""  I think I would toy with the filling if I were to make them again, keeping them lowfat, but replacing the cottage cheese with something else."
242729,15211,2007-04-11,5,"A French classic which I often make - this recipe was absolutley perfect, with suberb instructions and serving tips - thanks Derf, for reminding me to make this great potato dish again! I changed nothing - I have a slightly different recipe, so I wanted to see how this worked - it was flawless....classic dishes need no gilding, and this is a good example. Thanks Derf.FT:-)
(My camera is packed ready for my trip to the UK - sorry.....next time!)"
570804,15211,2007-10-16,5,Thanks for reminding me of this classic potato dish.  Have made it in the past but it has been overlooked.   Simple and elegant. Needs nothing else added.  Your method is excellent.  Thanks Derf.
107583,458729,2013-05-08,5,Simple and tasty.  Loved the lemon and chives-nice and light.
342165,286851,2008-02-19,0,"I havent made this, wondering why there is no nutrition info?"
791948,286851,2008-06-26,5,"I loved your story! That was a five star story! I decided to make it just for fun and it was really good. Reminded me of the stories my Grandmother used to tell me when I was younger.

Thanks so much
Who needs the nutritional info on these simple ingredients??? Just make it."
131021,35632,2010-06-26,5,"This was so good, we put it on turkey and havarti croissant sandwiches and it was perfect. I made a quarter batch and used a bit more garlic so it was strong but that was still great. YUM."
2001956563,298874,2018-01-27,0,Was perfect for our family who turned last night’s chicken fingers into a great southern breakfast.
339025,298874,2008-06-08,4,"I tried this recipe when i was trying to decide what to with with some left over biscuits. I did not have sausage, so the title clicked. I made the recipe minus the poultry seasoning (due to personally not caring for that seasoning). I then poured the gravy over the biscuits and popped them in the oven for a few minutes. The gravy had soaked in and the biscuits were to die for! Yummy!"
453828,298874,2008-07-10,5,"Love it!  I was looking for a recipe to make ""gravy"" for rice knowing that my lemon chicken (to accompany the rice and vegetable side dishes) would not produce enough drippings to make gravy.  I cut the recipe in half, and used 3/4 cup low sodium chicken broth and 1/4 cup half&half, and only used about 1/2 tsp homemade poultry seasoning.  Otherwise, I followed the directions/ingredients as written.  I loved the consistency, flavor and ease of preparation, and will make it again and again.  For biscuits, rice, vegetables, chicken, and whatever else might need added moisture and flavor!  Thanks for an easy and versatile recipe."
382322,298874,2009-03-25,5,This is a GREAT sollution to a common problem. I usually cook link sausage and NEVER have enough drippings. THANK YOU for posting. I am a Yankee girl married to a Dixie boy... I am adding this one to my recipe box of tricks!
341344,298874,2009-05-15,5,"Growing up, I didn't realize you could use drippings to make gravy, because we always made it with butter.  We brown the flour in the pan by itself, and use evaporated milk instead of regular.  Either way, it makes a veggie friendly gravy that still tastes decadent!"
1063227,298874,2009-07-24,5,"This was so good and so easy! I was worried that I wasn't going to find a recipe for gravy without some sort of fat, but I liked this more than stuff made with fat anyway!"
1179225,298874,2011-12-10,5,We really loved this gravy. I was craving biscuits and gravy and only had a few sausage links. We found your recipe and I'm so glad we tried it. I normally get an upset stomach after eating sausage gravy due to all the fat. I was able to eat and enjoy a full serving of this tasty gravy. I'm not sure if its a good or bad thing to be able to east biscuits and gravy more oftern. Thanks so much for posting your recipe. I know I'll be making it again.
2216652,298874,2012-03-20,1,"I made this gravy exactly according to the recipe. I didnt care for the taste. nor did it come to a boil as it was supposed to. I ended up having to put in a packaged gravy mix made into a rou(?) just to thicken it up. if I make this again, it will most definately be without the poultry seasoning."
2868065,298874,2013-06-18,5,My family and i LOVED this recipe! Was a little iffy about using the chicken seasoning at first but it flavored it quite nicely! First no sausage recipe I have tried and had it actually turn out. I used sausage links and added them to this gravy... Fantastic!!
42223864,298874,2013-09-06,5,Watch the salt... I used a poultry seasoning that had salt in it. When I did it without the salt it was fantastic. It would make fantastic chicken gravy as well
1800050891,298874,2013-11-22,5,"I&#039;m very happy I found this recipe! I only added a little salt, a good amount of pepper, and a very good amount of ground sage! The only way you can tell it doesn&#039;t have sausage in it is because there aren&#039;t any actual pieces of meat! Sage is great! (: My 1 year old and I ate until we were full! I can&#039;t wait to make this for my husband!"
1802319664,298874,2014-01-13,4,"This is the perfect gravy if you like regular biscuits and gravy, but are trying to go vegetarian. HOWEVER, I changed the recipe. I made it exactly as described here and didn&#039;t like it (had to throw it out). The way I made it next and to my liking was everything the same, EXCEPT - 1/4 tsp Pure Maple Syrup added to melted butter before adding flour, and 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning. The original called-for 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning was WAY too much, so the reduced 1/4 teaspoon makes it just right. It tastes just like regular sausage gravy (I used to make mine with maple sausage)."
215922,298874,2014-01-17,5,"I just tried this recipe for breakfast and loved it!  I was tired of my usual egg and toast, but didn&#039;t want a plain English muffin and then remembered seeing this recipe last night.  I halved the recipe and added the sage/poultry seasoning and salt and pepper to taste and topped a toasted English muffin with about half the sauce.  It definitely hit the spot.  I never realized the seasoning I love so much in breakfast sausage is sage/poultry seasoning!   I am saving the rest for my husband to try when he gets home from work.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Bravo!"
2000157964,298874,2015-12-29,5,I didn&#039;t make any changes and it tastes just like gravy made with sausage.
2001176126,298874,2016-09-20,5,Tasted absolutely amazing! And to give it a little kick I did a pinch of crushed red peppers and the smallest pinch of cian pepper(may of spelled that wrong) and it tasted absolutely perfect. Definitely plan to make this a lot.
2001795303,298874,2017-11-14,5,On a fly I found this ah 5:30am this morning. Put it all together no tweaking and it tastes so good. Can't wait to wake him up to enjoy it on some biscuits!!
2002313717,298874,2018-10-27,5,"This was so good! It was my first time making gravy and it turned out fantastic. My picky husband and kids made sure there was nothing left! So I made some tweaks. Before starting the gravy, I fried a diced onion in a little bit of oil until browned. I then added the butter and flour to the pot and followed directions from there. I used almond milk instead of cow's milk, and once it was boiling, I threw in some pre-chopped grilled chicken and mixed it all together. Let it sit for a few minutes to thicken, then ladled it over biscuits. This was such a hearty, delicious breakfast. The kids want it again tomorrow morning!"
2002323255,298874,2018-11-06,5,This turned out great!
107135,111072,2006-04-26,5,this is one of the 1st cakes i learned to make . i loved this recipe .thanks for posting dee
328169,111072,2006-07-08,5,Easy and goooood.Edge
44160,111072,2008-07-02,5,"Good cake! Great to turn into a 6 layer cake. Either cut the three layers in half or bake 6 layers, about 15 minutes at 350. A good frosting recipe to go with this is: 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup butter, 2/3 cup half-and-half, 2 tablespoon corn syrup, 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1 (16-ounce) box confectioners' sugar, sifted, plus 1 cup, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix sugar, cocoa, butter, half-and-half, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan, stir, and bring to a boil. Continue to boil, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes or until thick. Remove syrup from heat, and beat in the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract with an electric mixer. Allow frosting to rest for a couple of minutes. At this time, if the frosting is too thick for spreading, add a bit of half-and-half, 1 tablespoon at a time, to bring frosting to proper spreading consistency."
407278,111072,2008-08-06,5,"This was the only cake my grandmother knew how to make, so I'm the third generation to use it.  It's also delicious with some grated coconut thrown in, and with coconut icing.  It will also survive being made with EggBeaters, skim milk, etc., if you worry about that.  Terrific cake recipe."
490764,111072,2008-09-03,5,"Wonderful recipe! Last week, I made a coconut cake with 1/2 cup coconut added to batter and I added some coconut to frosting and topped it off with a little toasted coconut.

Also, today, I tried this out for a 12""  marble cake. I need two 12"" tiers for a wedding cake soon and one recipe is perfect for one 12"" layer. I mixed as directions state and then reserved 1 1/2 cup of the mix which I added 1/4 cup cocoa to for the marbling effect."
1138677,111072,2009-01-21,0,"This was my dear Mom's recipe and the first one she taught me! Thanks for the wonderful memory. The only difference was she separated her eggs, added only the yolks when the recipe calls for ""eggs"" and whipped the egg whites till they peak. When the batter is done, fold in the egg whites and the vanilla. Makes a super light cake!"
570804,111072,2009-04-21,5,"This is the best butter type layer cake I have ever used and, I also, got it from my mother.  Very versatile and can be used for many purposes, including strawberry shortcake.   My favourite topping is a chocolate fudge icing.  Suggest that new bakers do not substitute margarine for the butter and also no shortcuts when it comes to the beating of the butter and sugar.  My only negative comment (and this is personal preference) I still prefer to separate the yolks from the whites and fold in the latter.
Thanks for submitting this cake Fauve."
114027,111072,2010-04-11,5,"Exactly the recipe I needed! This makes 3 thick layers so I often bake mine as 6 layers instead. This goes great with any icing or filling. I even used it to make a Tiramisu cake. Updated to mention that I have been using this recipe to make wedding cakes, it's a great basic recipe that goes well with all kinds of fillings and icings."
204024,111072,2011-08-26,5,Great recipe.  Made for I recommend.
2001857972,111072,2018-01-06,4,Wow!! IT’s really nice and really best birthday cake. You really did awesomely. http://cake-delivery.in/ahmedabad
6357,29916,2002-10-11,5,"Banana, milk and honey lovers are in for a treat!
I have this sometimes in the afternoons, for a very quick lunch, that's when I skip breakfast:-)
This is filling and good."
104295,29916,2004-06-08,5,"This is excellent.  I used skim milk and a frozen banana (I didn't have any that were not frozen).  With skim milk it is 5 WW points for the whole thing.  I split it with my 2 year old DD and counted it as 3.  It was a great fast brekafast as I put my makeup on and got ready to go.  So I didn't follow the going to bed part of it, but it sure was yummy and fast.  Thanks!"
64203,29916,2005-02-26,5,"I just made this for a quick afternoon treat and it was delicious! I used a ripe banana, but I think next time I'll use a frozen banana to add a little thickness to the shake. This was such a delicious drink! I'll be making this again!"
71029,29916,2005-02-27,4,"Freezing the banana does have make the shake ""sleep-inducing"" because your body starts to use energy to warm up after you drink it.  Very healthy and filling with skim or soy milk!   I add a little cardamom and nutmeg, sweet dreams!"
189616,29916,2005-03-10,5,"Thanks Kim D. my husband and boys really enjoyed it, I put the bananas in the freezer for an hour or so, and it blended perfectly smooth and creamy. Unfortunately though it didn't work--my boys were still bouncing off the walls-FOR THAT YOU GET 2!!!!Just kidding, keep posting more goodies."
160974,29916,2005-03-11,5,"I have been making ""banana milk"" for years, and have always found it really comforting. I saw that you put honey in  your recipe, so I thought I'd try it. It did add a nice flavor dimension to it. I always add some grated nutmeg on top. If only my daughter (who has a difficult time falling asleep) liked banana flavor!

36128,29916,2005-03-30,5,"This was really very good.  I am feeling very sluggish right now, and I am going to go lay down, hoping that this helped my poor pregnant body tonight.  Thanks so much for the wonderful drink."
43083,29916,2005-08-10,5,I cant believe I have never seen this recipe before! I had a ripe banana that needed to be used so I made this for a quick breakfast. Added 2 ice cubes but that is it. Thanks for a simple but yummy drink that I will make again:)
1397394,29916,2009-09-27,5,"This is my new favorite recipe!  It's so refreshing and the ingredients are perfectly balanced.  I also added 2 ice cubes and I use frozen bananas instead.  It definitely makes me feel relaxed, thank you!"
28177,327059,2012-09-20,5,"I have to admit that I wasn't sure about the use of sun-dried tomato in deviled eggs, but I feel like I've tried just about every other combination of fillings out there, and I had the tomatoes on hand.  What a surprise!  These eggs have a unique flavor and exciting color that others don't have.  The real test though, is 6-year old DD, who never eats anything but the egg whites.  Tonight she helped make these eggs, and then she actually ate the whole thing.  Several times over!  :)  I had to use dried basil.  Unfortunately, I just threw out what was left of the fresh I had yesterday (was looking a little dark), not realizing I would be able to use it up before it was too late.  I know the flavor will pop even more with fresh basil next time.  Vicky, we will remember you fondly every time we enjoy this recipe.  Made and enjoyed in memory of VickyJ, a very special forum host."
47892,327059,2012-09-29,5,"I used fresh basil and green onions from our CSA; local eggs! Super easy! We cook<br/>our hard boiled eggs the same way, too! Reviewed for VickyJ's Cookathon. Rest in peace, Vicky J."
481371,257084,2007-10-31,4,This was delish!!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!!
833516,324047,2008-11-04,5,This is the bomb! Looks like puke but so awesome. I have been making this for years and any where it goes it always gets requests again and again!
27783,21428,2003-03-01,5,"Thank you for sharing this simple, yet tasty recipe.  I was very ill and my husband and daughter cooked this to accompany supper. Simple enough for a beginner cook to follow and produced very tasty garlic bread.  Enjoyed by all!"
35526,21428,2003-09-24,5,"Could not be simpler or more tasty.  I only made a half a loaf and used 6 cloves of crushed garlic.  I did not melt the butter, just let it get room temp and mixed it with the half ton of garlic.  YUMMM!  Went very well with our lasagna."
32772,21428,2003-09-29,5,"This is easy and taste great. I didn't broil the bread but stacked the slices as if the bread was just sliced, covered in aluminum foil and baked in a 375 degree oven for 10 minutes. Mmmmm...good"
31499,21428,2003-10-01,5,"Simplicity at it's best.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  So easy to put together, and is ready in no time at all.  A very simple recipe that makes a huge impression. A keeper for sure!"
37106,21428,2003-10-02,5,What could be simplier yet packed with more garlicky goodness than this recipe? I too used more garlic and prepared this in a matter of minutes. Sometimes a recipe doesn't need all that added stuff. Simple and basic is sometimes best which certainly holds true for this recipe. Thank you so much Miss Nezz!
28649,21428,2003-10-26,5,"Very good garlic bread.  So simple and easy to make, I will make it often.  Everyone in the family really enjoyed it.  Thanks Mizz Nezz."
36944,21428,2004-01-26,5,A quick and easy bread that makes a tasty addition to any meal.  
48288,21428,2004-12-02,5,"I never buy store gaslic bread any more... this is so much better. I add more garlic and a little dry parsley for a great presentation.
"
56680,21428,2005-12-06,4,"A Yummy way to make garlic bread, I altered the recipe by placing the slices on cookie cooling racks then placing in the oven, this way both sides ""toast evenly."
101823,21428,2005-12-07,4,"I sliced my bread prior to brushing with the butter and garlic mix, and used roasted garlic in the butter.  Toasted on parchment on a cookie sheet, this was excellent garlic bread."
272014,21428,2005-12-10,5,"if you brush all of the sides, you get bread that is more garlicy
"
426062,21428,2007-03-25,5,Very good basic recipe.  I decided to let my Italian heritage show through by adding more garlic and drizzling some EVOO into the butter/garlic mix.  Then I sprinkled salt and some dried oregano flakes on top.  That made it taste just like in a restaurant.
133174,21428,2007-05-30,5,Easy and delicious...who could ask for more?  Made this to go with lasagna.  It was perfect.
454804,21428,2008-02-20,5,Wonderful!! after broiling I sprinkled one half with 4 cheese mexican cheese and broiled another minute. Thanks
302094,21428,2008-03-15,5,"This is great bread! I made stuffed shells so of course I needed a bread to go with it, and this fit the bill. I did add mozzerella cheese before I broiled the bread. I will definately be making this again. Thanks, MizzNezz!"
808535,21428,2008-06-01,5,"Absolutely perfect! My brother recommended this recipe to me and said I should sprinkle some dried Oregano on top to make it look better. So delicious, I will definitely make this again."
486078,21428,2008-11-03,5,This is perfect!  I'm working on getting my meatball and spaghetti sauce recipe just right to make public and  this is the garlic bread I will suggest serving with it!  Thx. for posting such a simple and delish recipe. I will use the fresh orgeano as someone suggested.
294274,21428,2008-12-30,5,"I love the flavor of this garlic bread. It will hold it's own in a meal, yet is not overpowering and I love the fact that it only uses 3 ingredients! Thanks for sharing! This will accompany every Italian dinner in our house!"
309923,21428,2009-01-10,5,"Wonderful garlic flavor, and just what I was looking for in a garlic bread recipe; real garlic, not garlic salt and butter.  I microplaned the garlic, and added a little bit of oregano.  Thanks!"
140132,21428,2009-12-09,5,Wonderful!  I love the simplicity of this bread.  Its what it is....garlic bread.  I like that you can taste the bits of garlic and butter.  Thank you so much for sharing.
135887,385071,2009-09-06,4,"I love the concept of these.  Made as directed, I thought they lacked in flavor.  Will make again but need to think of a way to punch them up a bit."
305531,385071,2009-08-16,5,"Yum! These are fun, simple, and tasty. I wasn't sure the best way to get them out of the muffin tin, so inverted them onto a baking sheet. Some of them came out fine, but some stuck a little more. The ones that wouldn't come out right away, I let sit for about 5 minutes and used a knife to loosen them up a bit. Very tasty, but think I need to work on presentation a little more, lol. Thanks diner for a fun side dish. Made for NKOTB Tag.  BTW - these are good cold too!"
522275,385071,2009-08-20,5,"Delicious and so easy!  I only had red potatoes and cheddar, but it was still wonderful and my family gobbled it up.  I greased my muffin pan with butter instead of spray and used a knife to loosen the gratins from the pan -- worked great!  Thanks for sharing her recipe with us.  I'm looking forward to using it again with other cheeses.  :)"
88378,385071,2009-08-21,5,"I've made these several times since she won Next Food Network Star.  I like to use jumbo-sized muffin tins and pack them pretty tightly with potatoes, placing the potatoes around the sides of each cup as well as stacking them.  I also like mozzarella cheese better than Swiss.  I like very finely chopped red onion, and for the cream I just put a tablespoon into each cup.  I salt, pepper, onion and cheese them as I build them (not just on top.)  I also bake them longer to get them crunchy around the edges.  These potatoes are so good we could fight over them!!  Fabulous recipe!"
905569,385071,2009-08-24,5,"I've made these 3 times since she won and love them!!  So many possible combinations.  I salt & pepper each side of each slice of potatos and sometimes add garlic powder too.  Like vivmom, I also pack them tightly around the sides.  Trying to use up the chives from my herb garden, so I've been placing them in each layer, along w/ nacho/monterrey jack shredded cheese and occasionally some bacon pieces.  Fantastic!!"
780064,385071,2009-08-29,5,as easy as it sounds and delicious!
161265,385071,2009-08-30,5,Loved these!  I used my regular sized muffin tins and filled all 12 of them up AND still didn't use all the potato (maybe I had a too big tater!).  Next time I'll use a jumbo sized muffin tin.  Very tasty!  And easy too.
869532,385071,2009-09-01,5,I fell in love with this easy and delicious recipe the minute I saw Melissa making it on TV. I will make these often. I slice the potatoes with a mandolin. It's also fun to use different cheeses and adding herbs and garlic. Great versatile dish!
766961,385071,2009-09-09,5,"I have been *dying* to use this recipe since I saw her make these.  I finally gave in and used what I had.  I used mozzarella cheese and had to improv with a milk/sour cream mixture.  I also lightly sprinkled a little dried chopped onion.  Thanks for posting this on recipezaar, easier to keep track of!"
779699,385071,2009-10-26,5,These are super! I really loved them! I made four of them (2 of us) and I used swiss = cheddar and I added minced garlic between the layers (we LOVE garlice)! I love all of the different possibilities!!! Thanks for posting! [Made for Holiday Tag October 2009!]
808027,385071,2009-10-27,5,"These are great, and they come together in no time at all.  I love that they are made in muffin tins...great idea.  Full of flavor...you'd expect nothing less from Melissa D'arabian.  Love her!  Thanks for posting this -- you beat me to it.  :-)"
88099,385071,2009-11-13,5,"So good.  I used cheddar cheese for personal preference and cooked mine a little long so they got slightly burned around the edges, but still tasted great.  I used fat-free half & half in place of the cream and it worked well.  Thanks.  Made for Zaar Stars :)"
482933,385071,2009-11-18,5,"Loved the crustiness, taste, and technique!  I made enough for the two of us and divided between regular 8 muffin pan sections and it was done fast-25 minutes but you see that mine were not thick either. I used a spoon to remove and blotted them a bit.  Thanks diner524 for posting.  Am emailing this one out."
168462,385071,2009-11-22,5,"My family really liked these. In anticipation of that and their hearty appetites, I made these in a large pan. I layered the potato, salt pepper, a little garlic powder and cheese and then repeated until I had used up all my potatoes. I did not have heavy cream so I just used skim milk. They  were so popular I made them again the next day. I think they would make a great presentation if made in the muffin tins. Thanks for the recipe."
227978,385071,2009-12-19,5,"These were spectacular gratins.  Easy to prepare, and ready in the exact time noted in the recipe.  I will definitely make these often.  Thanks, Diner.  Yum."
26512,385071,2009-12-26,4,"This was very good. I was sick, didn't feel like fooling with the muffin tins, so I just layered in a casserole dish. It did take longer to cook, obviously and I had to add more salt, but will definitely make again, hopefully in the muffin tins next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
125411,385071,2009-12-27,5,Fabulous. Served with rack of lamb and roasted brussels sprouts.
280271,385071,2010-01-11,5,These are every bit as good as I thought they would be. I used all the ingredients listed with no added spices and DH and I were very impressed with the flavor. I cut the recipe in half and made jumbo muffins. I got 3 nice size servings with my potato. I used the suggestion of putting slices of potato around the muffin cup. I also topped them with additional potato slices. I cooked them for 1 hour and they came out perfect. Crispy on the outside tender on the inside. I decided not to flip them out of the pan but to serve them right side up. This is going in my best of 2010 cookbook. Thanks for posting. :)
960709,385071,2010-02-07,4,"Can't believe I forgot to review this, made it back in November at the deer lease.  We really enjoyed these and it was easy to do.  I did salt and pepper each layer. It was nice to have something that felt a little 'sophisticated' to eat down at the deer lease.  Thanks for posting the recipe."
226863,385071,2010-04-10,0,"I wanted to make this for two, so I halved the recipe and then made it in small gratin bowls.  So I adjusted the cooking time, although I found I really didn't need to.  I did cut my potatoes very thin, so that probably helped in reducing the cooking time.  The taste was wonderful!  I'll do this again....I can make it for just a few people and not have to deal with the leftovers of a big gratin dish!  Thanks for sharing...made for Potluck tag."
128473,385071,2010-05-12,5,"What a lovely recipe diner.  We really enjoyed these quick and easy to make potatoes.  I made in a dish big enough for two.  I adjusted the  ingredients and time accordingly.  These turned out perfectly.  Tender and flavorful. The swiss cheese and sweet onions were a lovely addition. I didn't have any green onions left, so I used vidallias...they were nice in this dish. Thanks so much for sharing a dish I will make again. :)"
171790,385071,2011-02-11,5,These were a hit at dinner tonight. I ended up making 12 because there was too much potato to fit into 8 muffin cups. I grated a bit more cheese and sliced a third green onion for the extra 4 potato gratins. I also didn't end up using 3/4 cup of cream. I just poured a bit over each assembled muffin tin without measuring the amount but I would guess that each muffin tin got a couple of tablespoons of cream. Made for Best of 2010 Tag Game Event.
383346,385071,2012-01-06,5,Me and DH loved this recipe.  It's so easy to do.  We'll be doing it again soon.  I had only mozzarella cheese.  And I added yellow onions.  The taste was fabulous.  And I used 1 tbs of heavy cream in each.  Thanks diner :)  Made for Holiday tag game
286566,385071,2011-04-18,4,"I made these using 1 1/2 cup ceramic oven proof souffle dishes and allowed an hour to cook at 200C (non fan forced oven), I used 3 large nadine potatoes and got 4 layers in my dish.  The drawback in my selection of baking dish is I don't think they browned on the bottom as well as they should have as compared to a metal container so would like to try again using texas muffin pans but overall this dish is quite rich even though I only used a little less than 2 tablespoons of thicken cream per serve but overall an enjoyable potatoe dish.  Thank you diner524, made for Went To Market tag game."
482376,385071,2011-05-11,5,"These were absolutely fabulous! I loved how crispy all the outer edges got. I used shredded parmesan because I'm not a fan of swiss. I think cheddar would be nice, too. The directions were perfect."
649173,385071,2011-05-14,5,"We had these for dinner last night to go with salmon filet and baked beans.  Perfect combination, but would go with any main dish I'm sure.  Had to use Vidalia onion as I was out of green, but they were wonderful with the Vidalias.  Mine stuck to the dish a little, but were still very presentable.  Thanks so much for a tasty treat that I'll be making often. ."
136997,385071,2011-05-20,5,"Easy to assemble and very tasty, I had some smoked provolone that needed to be used up and the flavour was perfect. :)."
1701315,385071,2011-06-17,5,"Wow.  These are so flavorful and so easy!  I used red skin potatoes, and did half with gruyere and half with cheddar.  I salt and peppered each layer and used less than 1 T cream per gratin.  Wonderful, wonderful!"
1058097,385071,2011-06-20,4,"It's a good idea in theory.  They're quite easy, so long as you choose potatoes that are the same size as the muffin tin--otherwise it's a job to fit them in right.  But next time I would not use raw potatoes, although I usually prefer them.  I had to cook them for an hour to cook the potatoes through, and that meant the cheese and onions were scorched.  They still get four stars on flavor alone.  With pre-cooked potatoes, this recipe would probably be perfect."
690623,385071,2011-06-21,5,These were fun to make and had a wonderful taste and presentation!  I was leary because I don't bake much and anticipated a problem with my ancient muffin tins.  I don't use Pam but greased the tins quite heavily and had no trouble turning them out.  Super flavour!  Thanks for posting.  Made for Food.Commandos ~ ZWT 7
66448,385071,2011-06-25,5,"These were absolutely delish!!! I cut it in half for the 2 of us & used custard cups instead of muffin pans, sprayed well with Pam & had no trouble with sticking. I got 4 custard cups & only used 1 baking potato well washed, thinly sliced with skin on. I have 2 left & can't wait to use them up tomorrow with grilled pork chops. What a great recipe so elegant looking, wish I had it when the outlaws came for dinner, would have made a nice impression. I also used gruyere cheese, shredded & topped each cup off with the whipping cream. Will be making these very often."
323186,385071,2011-06-28,5,"This worked very well for me, I had wondered if they would stick but I had no trouble at all, even allowing for old and well-used muffin tins.  I used the coarse side of my grater to roughly slice/grate the raw potatoes, and I used shredded parmesan, not having swiss.  I guess-timated the cream.    They cooked perfectly, tasted Delicious, I'm not a huge potato fan but I do like a creamy potato bake,  and crispy roasted potatoes, I would say that this is the best of both worlds!  Thank you Diner, a keeper!"
852554,385071,2011-06-29,5,"I halved this recipe, except used the same amount of green onions... yummy is all I can say!  Went perfect with the roast chicken we got!"
60260,385071,2011-07-27,5,"I made this recipe ""as is"" but used ramekins vs. a muffin tin.  They turned out well and is great side to just about anything.  Quick and easy.   Will do these again."
1695616,385071,2011-08-06,0,"copy and pasted review from the Food Network website...putting it here for easy reference for me when I get ready to try this out!.....""I've made this five or six times now and love it! The best variation I've tried so far is to dice finely one-half of a large Jalapeno and let it steep in the cream over the heat. Then strain the jalapeno flavored cream over the potatoes and sprinkle the Jalapeno bits on top. Be sure to do at least four layers of thinly sliced potatoes (two or three potatoes per layer and Mexican-blend cheese and overfill the tins slightly because it all compacts during cooking. I've also tried it with thyme-infused cream and other times I've used smoked cheddar, spicy jack, and gruyere cheeses. They were all great! These freeze and reheat nicely, by the way!"""
526666,385071,2011-10-19,5,"This recipe makes a nice presentation, if you feel like your potatoes are boring. I 'shaved' my potato, making the slices as thin as chips. I used a jumbo muffin pan, and filled all 6, making approximately 3-4 layers of potatoes, with cheese sprinkled in between the layers. Hard to believe there is no butter in this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised with how well these turned out. Tasty and crispy, they were devoured! When I want to impress my guests, I will pull out this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing, diner!"
590815,385071,2011-10-24,5,This recipe is really yummy my husband loved it and is very easy to make.
949568,385071,2012-08-08,5,"We had fun with these.  We didn't remove the foil halfway through.  The plus side of that is the potatoes cooked in 35 minutes.  The downside, they were pale and not crusty, and we had to scoop our portion out of the muffin cup at the table.  Taste-wise they were good.  Made for ZWT8 trip to Australia / New Zealand.  Thanks for the fun diner!"
1169750,385071,2014-07-31,5,"Made as directed.  Outstanding!  Slice potatoes wafer thin, use a good variety of swiss cheese and you can&#039;t go wrong."
1803423832,385071,2014-11-27,5,Don&#039;t bother inverting. I run a knife around them when they just come out of oven and then let rest for five to ten mins covered. Just run a small spoon around tin and they pop out. I use gruyere and salt and pepper tops before I spoon on cream. Don&#039;t have to make them that thick either to avoid longer cook times. Delish!!!
400708,385071,2016-07-14,5,"So easy, fast and impressive looking with great taste, what more could you want, using my food processor to slice the potatoes made it even easier, made it exactly as listed and loved it"
1068514,342698,2008-12-11,0,this brownie is so good and chewy i rate is as a 4
1028335,342698,2009-01-06,4,i used part splenda and since i have no mixer i winged it and mixed by hand. still tastes darn good! once i pick up a mixer i'll try again...
90180,124597,2005-06-11,4,"I'm always looking for a new way to do asparagus and this is a fine choice.  Simple and tasty.  Thanks, riffraff!  I'll be making this again."
29782,124597,2006-02-18,5,A great side dish! Loved the flavor from the marinade and grill! I only used 1/2tsp of cayenne pepper cause I was afraid it would be to hot tasteing for us. It was perfect! Thanks so much Riffraff for sharing this delicious recipe! 
171303,124597,2006-07-07,5,I made this asparagus to go alongside Middle Eastern Kebabs #94798 and we really enjoyed it.  I halved the recipe without a problem and the asparagus had a nice tang from the dressing (I used fat free Italian) and heat from the cayenne.  Thank you Riffraff for sharing this simple and delish recipe.
153188,109818,2007-12-01,3,"These were good.  Definitely a different twist on the same old carrot dish.  I liked the bacon in it, but I like bacon in anything!  Thanks for a change of pace."
542159,483632,2012-07-22,5,"Wow Hokies you were right this does make a fantastic open faced sandwich! I halved some ciabatta rolls brushed with olive oil and popped under the broiled along with the tomatoes. The ricotta really adds nice texture and body to the topping on these wonderfully flavored topping, yes I know a whole tablespoon of dried oregano sounds like a lot but it is the perfect amount."
452940,459273,2011-07-05,4,"What better way to celebrate the 4th and summertime than with fresh fruit. I placed rows of strawberries and banana slices rather than top the bananas with them. Although I didn't get 13 stripes, but it was still festive and delectable. :)"
179133,449891,2011-10-28,5,Yummy! I wasn't sure how many apples to buy for 4 cups so went with 4 large but only ended up needing 3 (about 1 3/4 lb) to fill the pan (and still have room for the topping!) I used 2 granny smith and 1 golden delicious. There was a lot of topping (which I loved!) I did have to bake a little longer for the apples to get tender (about 15 minutes extra). Thanks for sharing!
383346,449891,2011-11-22,5,This recipe is so yummy.  I used Empire apples.  I omitted the salt.  But other than that followed the recipe.  Thanks BarbaraAnn :)  Made for Cookbook tag game
39754,187210,2006-09-27,5,"Needed Cajun spice for Lemon Cajun Stir Fry <a href=""/142201"">Lemon Cajun Stir Fry</a>, but forgot to get any while out shopping. Made this and it was perfect, I reduced the paprika to 2 level tablespoons in a moment of cowardice and my suspicions were right as the heat was just right for us! Thank you for a great recipe...just when I needed it."
283251,187210,2006-11-10,4,"Fabulous! I made this for use later this week for my Parmesan Potato Wedges #192904. I love spice blends. Thanks for sharing. :)

ETA: Whoo! That's spicy! A little too hot for DH, but I like it! :)"
14410,187210,2007-03-24,5,Very good and very easy. I was making cajun chicken-fried steak and discovered...no cajun seasoning in the cupboard. I'll never buy another jar again!
1072593,187210,2009-05-25,5,Another one in my book of honory Cajuns!  Made for ZWT5
212609,187210,2009-06-05,5,"A great blend of spices!!
We used it on some oven fries,and they were SO delicious...a perfect amount of heat!!
This will get well used in my house,as it's so versatile and can be quickly whipped up from store cupboard ingredients.
Thank you for a great recipe...made for Aussie Recipe Swap June 2009."
841895,187210,2009-06-10,5,"I used this to make pork chops a few days ago. While the chops didn't come out all that great, the seasoning tasted really good. I will be keeping this around and looking for a better pork chop recipe to use it in. Thanks!"
678366,187210,2010-04-15,5,This is the perfect seasoning for French Fries! Ingredients always on hand and anyway this is not available in the stores so one more reason to be so happy for finding it. Thanks for sharing this.
463435,187210,2010-05-25,5,Great seasoning blend...wonderful flavor without one spice overpowering the other. It is one my family will enjoy as it doesn't add to much heat. Another plus is it is made with spices and herbs I always have on hand. Thanks for posting Elmotoo. Made and reviewed for the 40th AUS/NZ Recipe Swap.
383346,187210,2011-03-06,5,I made it without salt.  This is really good.  Tonight we tried it on french fries.  Thanks Elmotoo :)  Made for PAC spring 2011
870705,187210,2013-11-30,5,Great Cajun seasoning blend.  Not too spicy.  Like you did I tried it out on Redneck Epicurean&#039;s recipe#146464 and it turned out wonderfully!  Made for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap.
47559,170336,2006-06-07,5,"I found a new cookie for my favorites cookie cookbook.  These are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and pack a wonderful spice flavor.  Very pretty and sparkly from the sugar crystals.  I don't really care for the taste of molasses, and tried Louisiana ribbon cane syrup instead.  It has the same color and texture, and a taste that is similar to the thick Dutch syrup I remember.  It worked beautifully in this cookie.  Thanks so much for posting this winner that will be made again and again."
145352,170336,2006-06-12,5,"SOOOOOOOOOO excellent!!!!! Thanks CIH!!!! But I have no idea how you got so many cookies! I ended up with 28....maybe I made them too big, but we loved them. A definite keeper!"
175492,170336,2006-06-16,5,"Ditto to Charmie's comments.  These are soooo darned good, and even make the house smell good while baking.  I used Black Strap Molasses, we really like molasses here, and these were the best.  Will be adding these to my cookies for gift making too as I am certain everyone will appreciate a box of these.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  The Dirty Pan Gang RULES!!!"
63335,170336,2007-01-14,5,"I loved these!  I had to make them last minute, and i didn't have any ground cloves...but they turned out great!  I will make these again!"
457690,170336,2007-05-26,5,"LOVED these. I only made half a recipe so the dough was very wet seeing that I couldn't really ""half"" an egg hehehe. I didn't have any molasses so I used pure maple syurp and they still tasted soooo good. I also sprinkled in a little cayenne pepper to give it an extra kick. 

Because the dough was so wet they spread like crazy so the cookies were super thin but I still thought they were excellent! I will for sure make these again!"
548608,170336,2007-08-23,5,"I have looked for years for the cookies my best friend's Mom made when we were kids ... Spicy Crinkles they were called.  These cookies are exactly what I have been looking for.  I made them thin and crispy and I, and my whole family LOVED them.  They didn't last long!"
44420,170336,2007-09-16,4,"Great cookie!  I added some ground cloves and ground mace because I was in the mood for them.  The cookie has nice texture - crisp outside, soft inside."
61525,170336,2007-12-09,5,"These cookies came out delicious!  Mine came out very chewy because I accidently added the whole 1 1/2 cups of sugar to the cookie mixture instead of reserving the 1/2 cup for rolling balls in...yumm......!  I'll make these again and again!

Thanks for posting!  :)

Martha"
868673,170336,2008-08-22,5,"My DH took these to work every day for over a week and he asked me to make them again.  For him to tell me he likes something is unusual, so I knew he must have REALLY liked them a lot!  I made following the recipe exactly and the result was a crispy on the outside, chewy inside delicious cookie that we both really liked!  I can see why they won 1st place!  Roni"
31316,170336,2008-12-07,5,These are awesome cookies!  I added a bit of mace and allspice to mine and they are excellent.  Thank you very much for sharing your recipe.
426156,170336,2008-12-30,5,"This is an excellent spice cookie - crispy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.  I added a little allspice, and will also try some cardamom next time.  I just gave these a light roll through colored sugar (making some red and some green for Christmas) instead of coating them with regular sugar.  Because colored sugar is usually more coarse than granulated sugar, I find it leaves a gritty texture if the cookie is completely coated in it.  Thanks for a very good recipe."
1800179196,501408,2013-11-02,1,"This was a fail for me!  Maybe because I used a handmixer, but I ended up with something very much resembling scrambled eggs and looking absolutely nothing like a pancake!"
2766292,501408,2013-07-16,5,"Try it , won&#039;t regret it!!!"
341486,501408,2013-07-20,1,"Sorry, this was not for me at all.  Tasted like a thin banana omelette. After I&#039;d made a few and the family all pulled faces I added flour, baking powder and milk to the remaining batter and made pancakes out of that.  They said the first ones had no &quot;bite&quot; to them."
2941555,501408,2013-08-12,5,"These are great, the kids love them! Mom and dad too!"
2958004,501408,2013-08-24,5,Very nice :)
1800042747,501408,2013-09-02,3,After reading some other reviews I thought what the heck. I added 1/2tsp of vanilla. The first few bites were interesting but soon after knew it was a banana omelette!! LOL Still worth a try just to say you did!! :)
1800044428,501408,2013-09-03,3,"I thought these were very good, for what they are.  I did add vanilla extract, just to give them a nicer flavor.  Will definitely be making these again."
1800258076,501408,2013-11-16,3,"Try adding only one egg and use yellow banana. Not overripe. You will have thin eggy pancakes with a too sweet banana flavor. Also, use minimal spray or oil as these can easily become too greasy. If they are too thin, a tbsp of flour will help."
1801221164,501408,2013-12-24,5,I put 1/2 tsp of Vanilla Extract
1802411092,501408,2014-01-25,5,"love! added vanilla. blended in bullet quick. very thin, cooked in butter. awesome! i don&#039;t mind the &#039;eggy&#039; flavor. needs no sweetener."
1802423641,501408,2014-01-28,5,So yummy...need to add cinnamon though!
1802430546,501408,2014-01-29,5,Turned out better than I expected. Definitely making again.
1802527471,501408,2014-02-25,4,"Added vanilla essence as per other reviews, also (on a second run) added 1 1/2 tsp of unsweetened cocoa. The result was pleasingly chocolatey, though it did need a little bit of extra sweetness added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&#039;s probably a disconnect between US and UK pancakes here - UK (though not Scottish) pancakes are usually quite thin, closer to crepes, US pancakes tend to be thicker. These will turn out thinner, like a UK pancake."
1384367,501408,2014-03-05,4,"I make these &quot;pancakes&quot; for my babies and they love them. (And these are the babies who throw scrambled eggs on the floor and drive their mother crazy by not eating protein.) They are thin and a bit eggy, though, so I&#039;ve got to go with four stars because they aren&#039;t really like pancakes. If you&#039;re looking for traditional pancakes, go elsewhere. Overall, these were a success! I recommend them for anyone with toddlers."
1802653462,501408,2014-04-08,1,This was very earthy to me; it need sugar or something.
42462903,501408,2014-06-20,5,"My daughter, who does not like eggs and never opts for protein, loved these.  They did not need extra sugar as you are going to put syrup anyway.  I would next time as per other reviewers try some cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla or banana extract.  But just as is was great for my 5 year old."
11395289,501408,2014-09-09,5,"This is a go to recipe for our house!  My toddler loves these and she typically doesn&#039;t like eggs!  We add 1/2 tsp of vanilla, sprinkle of cinnamon and a tsp of Sunflower Butter  (peanut butter).  We make in the morning and my husband and I take them in the car and eat on way to work, our daughter eats them with jam or sometimes syrup.  We made this with a potato masher... plus it was fun for our daughter to help."
1803298711,501408,2014-11-03,4,"For these pancakes I ended up blending the two ingredients making a very smooth and fluffy batter. Then continuing to add cinnamon, Salt and vanilla extract. Personally these worked very well considering I have a gluten-free diet they were fast and easy and very yummy. Don&#039;t make these pancakes thinking that they&#039;ll taste like wheat pancakes. With these pancakes I added peanut butter which pair nicely with the bananas."
11800120,501408,2014-12-02,3,Wait. I wrote an earlier review but forgot to say that I did one to one ratio.  One banana to one egg.  It was perfect.
1803680891,501408,2015-01-19,5,"This is a super quick, super easy, super healthy recipe that helps satisfy my pancake craving. Yes these are very thin a lot more similar to crepes so don&#039;t make these expecting your typical fluffy buttermilk pancakes. To enhance the flavor I also add a little vanilla extract and cinnamon to the mix. To help with the texture whip the eggs well before incorporating with the bananas and also add a little baking powder. This will make it a little fluffier. Finally I throw in a tsp of chia seeds to up the health factor and serve with a little maple syrup. Yummm."
1803739347,501408,2015-02-02,5,Excellant. Taste really good &amp; gave me my pancake fix without blowing my carbs for the whole day. They are best cooked slow &amp; watch for burning. Second side cooks very quickly.
2000085148,501408,2015-03-24,5,"Quick. Healthy. Delicious. Packed with protein and energy! As a student, this is an enrichment in my morning routine."
2000111149,501408,2015-04-03,1,Tastes like a banana omelette.
2000113837,501408,2015-04-04,5,"Loved this. Tasty with just the right amount of sweetness. I doubled the recipe and took away one egg, so I used two bananas and two eggs and it was perfect. Added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of ground up flax seeds to up the health content. Delicious!"
2000119862,501408,2015-04-05,1,"Well this was just disappointing. I don&#039;t know what I really expected but it tasted like banana and egg. Like another review said banana omelet, so just imagine adding bananas to your omelet which no one would and you have an idea of how this tastes. To be honest just cook the eggs and have the banana on the side much better and quicker! I don&#039;t eat pancakes often and this is a poor substitute. I&#039;d rather eat real fluffy thick pancakes smothered with butter and syrup once a year than make this again. People who gave this good reviews have obviously not had real pancakes in sometime."
2000134188,501408,2015-04-12,5,"delicious!!! they weren&#039;t too thick and i could finish the whole plate and i was full, not miserable, afterwards. i added a pinch of brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract by default, b/c that&#039;s what i do out of habit whenever i make pancakes. so yummy!"
2000187002,501408,2015-05-05,0,"Love this recipe! I also add vanilla paste or essence, cinnamon and berries at the end on top as well of youghut. I am on a health kick and this is the perfect, quick easy and yummy breakfast"
2000214796,501408,2015-05-20,4,"I found the one banana, two eggs was too runny. So I added another banana, and it was great! I also added a splash of cinnamon. Keep the pancakes small and they cook better too."
2000215790,501408,2015-05-21,4,"This is so delicious! I must agree that it is a little flat, but in all honesty it&#039;s healthiness outweighs it&#039;s appearance. Lactose &amp; gluten free! Will definitely be recommending it to all of my food intolerant friends :)"
2000222870,501408,2015-05-24,5,Loved these! Tasted just like normal pancakes which surprised me and my sister. I made a raspberry coulis to go with them and they were so good! Will definitely make these a lot more. Plus they&#039;re a much healthier alternative! Thanks!
2000226627,501408,2015-05-25,5,Very easy to make tasted just like a pancake. I used a food processor to blend smooth and also added some organic raw honey. Very nice recipe. Thanks.
2000260587,501408,2015-06-10,3,Doesn&#039;t taste bad! Especially if you add some vanilla extract and cinnamon but the texture.... Mine turned out looking like scrambled eggs. If you can ignore the looks and focus on the taste then it&#039;s for u!
2000261110,501408,2015-06-10,3,"I&#039;m not sure why would any one call this a &quot;pancake&quot;; I agree this is more like a sweet banana omelette or a banana crepe. It&#039;s not terrible, a bit plain in my opinion. It needs some fruit, honey, nutella,peanut butter  or nuts (or what ever you like) to enhace its flavor, otherwise it tastes as a banana omelette. I agree with other review I read earlier, who ever called them &quot;pancakes&quot; has not eaten real pancakes in a while. Still not bad, but I preffer to make mine like a crepe with something inside next time."
2000280265,501408,2015-06-19,5,"Mine turned out amazing!
I tweaked it a bit.. 
2 eggs
1 banana
Tbsp of weight control maple brown syrup oatmeal (Quaker)

Topped it with strawberries and a tsp of maple syrup"
2000287799,501408,2015-06-22,4,"Overall, I love these pancakes! They are healthy and easy, not to mention they taste great. The only things I can say about them is that they are super hard to flip, but once you get the hang of it, it&#039;s magic!
Also, I recommend using a blender instead of hand-mixing the ingredients and using honey and fruit to top it for a healthier alternative to maple syrup. And instead of using PAM, use coconut oil to rub across the pan.
I am about to make them right now again and I am going to put some cinnamon in it for extra flavor.
Have a nice day!"
2000340556,501408,2015-07-15,5,Absolutely love these pancakes. My family eats them up and asks for more.
2000383049,501408,2015-08-04,1,"It works sure, and if banana and egg is your thing then it will be great for you!
But for me it was a weird combination and the spongy omelette consistency was far from &#039;crepe like&#039;. 
Perhaps my egg to banana ratio was off?"
2000420418,501408,2015-08-22,5,Great way to get rid of overripe bananas. Classic breakfast in my home :)
368043,501408,2015-08-31,4,"I have made these a few times and really enjoy them.   Although I did alter the recipe a bit.  First, I only use one egg for one banana.  And then I add a tablespoon of flour for just a little bulk.  They taste like pancakes to me with these two changes."
2000449728,501408,2015-09-02,4,This recipe is great if you are trying to loose weight as a healthy and low calorie snack. However 2 eggs make it taste to eggy. One egg to one large/medium banana is just fine. Especially if you want to keep the sweet taste of the banana.
1801553725,501408,2015-09-12,1,"Terrible texture, terrible taste.  Worse with syrup.  Don&#039;t waste your ingredients.  This will never pass as a pancake."
2000474827,501408,2015-09-14,5,"I Love these pancakes -- I originally saw the recipe on Pinterest but that one added cinnamon to the mix and I really think that makes a difference. It gives it more flavor and the pancakes come out a little more brownish and looking like regular pancakes. Anyway, they are light, delicious and the kids and I love them. One piece of advice would be to be sure they are firmed up before trying to flip them or it will fall apart and not look so nice. So cook it mostly on the one side, the flip and cook for just 20-30 seconds on the other side."
2000526525,501408,2015-10-05,5,"I added Cinnamon and Vanilla to the mix, cooked them well on the griddle and they tasted very good. I topped with a bit of peanut butter and honey. Perfect for a light breakfast! My son loves them. He&#039;s 8 months and literally inhaled them."
2000540454,501408,2015-10-09,1,"I am sorry, but this didn&#039;t work for me at all. It looked like banana scrambled eggs. To not waste the ingredients I threw half of the banana/egg mix to some complete buttermilk pancake mix I had home and added some water to soften the mix. I ended with a fairly good pancake. It was a bit too fluffy because I added baking powder to the banana/egg mix but at least it was edible."
2000431901,501408,2015-10-30,5,"These were great! We whipped the eggs really well first, then added the banana and used the blender to make it totally smooth. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. They were similar enough to real pancakes, a wonderful grain free substitute. So sweet from the banana that they didn&#039;t need syrup, we just topped them with chopped kiwi and strawberries. My two year old actually did all the work except the cooking, and gobbled three of them down."
2000648966,501408,2015-11-07,4,Adding a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder helps make them more of the consistency of a regular pancake. I also add a little vanilla and cinnamon. You can even throw in some choc chips tho that obviously detracts a bit from the healthiness. :)
2000688081,501408,2015-11-17,4,"A ratio of one egg to one banana is definitely the way to go. Delicious banana flavor, no need for syrup. I had trouble flipping them, they tend to fall apart. Cook over lower heat and use a lid."
2001061706,501408,2016-06-24,1,"If you like scrambled eggs with bananas mixed right in, this recipe is for you. The egg to banana ratio is too high."
2001102034,501408,2016-07-25,3,"It tastes really great but I found the batter really thin, so when it came to flipping the pancakes they just fell apart - it would work better for pancake bites than full sized pancakes :)"
2001084886,501408,2016-09-13,5,I make these pancakes all of the time. They are great and low calorie. We top with fresh sliced strawberries and a dot of cool whip.
1801189345,501408,2016-10-24,5,"Made these this morning and I was pleasantly surprised. Didn't know what to expect. Used recipe, as is, with no additions. My husband loved them, too. What is easier than two eggs and a banana on a griddle? Healthy, quick, and no mess."
2001354586,501408,2017-01-16,0,"Was ok, even one egg and one banana was still too runny, added some pancake mix to it. First pancake was ok, 2nd and third from the mix were better. Next time I will try 3 bananas and 2 eggs. 1.5 banana to 1 egg seems like a better ratio."
2001362345,501408,2017-01-22,4,"We didn't have any of the problems others are listing here when made as the recipe directed. We made sure the griddle was nice and hot, and we used about 2 Tablespoons of &quot;batter&quot; per pancake -- no problems flipping. Worked great, tasted great. Added a little maple syrup to a few of them, but the blend of banana and maple flavors was weird to my palate, and it didn't need it. I tweaked the next batch to a 1:1 ratio and added cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla. I liked the consistency better on the 2nd batch."
2001364700,501408,2017-01-24,4,I adjusted the recipe: - 1 ripe banana - 1 egg - 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract - 3 tablespoons flour Topped with crunchy peanut butter and/or syrup. Very tasty and easy!
2001368868,501408,2017-01-28,4,This was amazing!!!!! I didn't whisk the eggs enough though :( My bad.... lol
2001377865,501408,2017-02-04,4,"I am a big fan of these. I stay away from refined sugar, but that doesn't mean I don't still crave it. I used a bit of vanilla, a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and a tablespoon of powdered peanut butter with added protein. They taste like Peanut butter cup pancakes. My five year old requests them and will eat four or five in a sitting, so I call it a win with the added ingredients."
2001381315,501408,2017-02-06,3,"I did the 1 egg to 1 banana ratio. I added vanilla, milk, and some nuts to the batter. Made it into a roll and added peanut butter. Tasted great."
2001391802,501408,2017-02-14,5,I don't even like eggs and I loved this!! I did the one banana and two eggs ratio and I added fruit on top and drizzled a little honey on top.... It was amazing!!!
2001396405,501408,2017-02-18,2,"It tasted like a weird french toast with banana instead of bread. The egg to banana ratio was definitely off. Also, the texture did not resemble a pancake."
2001399441,501408,2017-02-20,0,I use a mixer and 1/8 tsp baking powder... makes a big difference in texture!
1790123,501408,2017-02-23,5,"Best pancakes ever! So sweet, addictive, and easy. I added a dash of salt, cinnamon, and vanilla."
1803589550,501408,2017-03-02,5,I made these but added a teaspoon of plain flour for texture. I also added raisins as they were cooking.
2001436774,501408,2017-03-15,5,I eat these every few days. I add cinnamon to the mix and then add honey on top when done. I love these. A few blueberries or sliced banana goes a long way too! Everyone I make these for loves them and such a good breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!
2001437598,501408,2017-03-15,5,"Tastes awesome! Used 1 egg 1 banana, pinch of baking powder and cinnamon sugar. Blended in a smoothie mixer. Touch of maple syrup on top! Didn't taste eggy at all :)"
2001443744,501408,2017-03-18,0,"I love this recipe. It's not as dry as a pancake, more like you said, a pudding, therefore I don't need to add any syrup of any sort. My husband has type 2 diabetes, so this is about as close as we can come to a bread, which we can't have on our Kenogeyics diet. It's delicious!"
2001467861,501408,2017-04-02,5,"we were looking for something sweet and decided to make these odd pancakes,they were to thin, so we put oatmeal in it,but it all turned out as mush!"
2001476275,501408,2017-04-07,2,The picture CANNOT be from these 'pancakes'. I agree with the banana omelette stories. It got two stars for creativity.
2001484054,501408,2017-04-12,5,omg i love these... i added about a teaspoon and a half of baking powder and made a little larger pancakes... also did not flip them just put them under the broiler to finish them off... i have made these about a hundred times since finding the recipe and they are fabulous... i wouldnt thank you for original pancakes now :)
2001488417,501408,2017-04-14,5,"Love these little gems. Quick, easy and tasty"
2001516589,501408,2017-05-01,3,"The first time I tried this, I ended up with something similar to scrambled banana eggs. The second time, I used a firm banana and whipped the egg whites. Perfection! The recipe as stands uses a ripe or mushy banana. When you use a firmer one and whip the whites, your pancake is similar to a pancake and holds together well"
2001523517,501408,2017-05-06,4,It is a quick and easy healthy breakfast good for kids. Toppings are optional but the sweetness from the bannana is good enough. One little thing sometimes adding flour can help
2001539151,501408,2017-05-15,0,I love these. If you add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder they puff up like real pancakes. Does anyone know what you can substitute the banana with for a savory option?
2001600960,501408,2017-06-26,5,"Not to be dramatic, but this banana pancake recipe changed my life. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon but besides that, this recipe was perfect! If you whisk the eggs thoroughly before adding the mashed banana, the finished product is super light and fluffy. You'll need a lot of cooking spray, however, because they're harder to flip than regular pancakes."
2001604614,501408,2017-06-29,5,"The recipe is great! The pancakes take much much less time than regular pancakes, and the final product feels much 'lighter' - it's more similar to thin pancakes than the English fluffy pancakes. Tastes great. Small tweaks/advice: - I used 1 egg, 1 banana + a bit of baking powder as seen in the comments. I also used a hand-held mixer to get an even consistency. I got two small pancakes out of that. They can be hard to flip as the top does not set, so making your pancakes smaller and flipping them quickly will avoid spillage. They really do need only about 30sec per side, but if you leave them on a bit too long you can't taste the difference, even if they look very dark on the surface."
2001604721,501408,2017-06-29,1,I know everyone is different but these were not what I expected
2001606241,501408,2017-06-30,0,"well, I tried it with the one egg and cinnamon but it didn't fry up nice into a pancake. I added the other egg and made it into banana scrambled eggs. Not bad, even good and low cal. Thumbs up!!"
2001606295,501408,2017-06-30,5,These were fluffy and delish! I would say the trick is to smash the banana but not to whip them with a blender or anything. I left a little texture and the were very good and fluffy.
2001607225,501408,2017-07-01,4,Great idea and overall outcome nothing like pancakes burning enjoyed it great for after training
2001542623,501408,2017-07-24,5,"I read all of the comments, and decided to use 1/2 banana and 1 egg. I added 3/4 tsp of baking powder and 2 good shakes of cinnamon. I ate 1/2 of the banana. I whipped the egg, then mashed the other 1/2 of the banana into the egg. Let it sit for a few minutes! I tried making smaller pancakes, but they ran into each other, so I made a lunch plate sized pancake. I was not interested in a banana omelet, so I flipped it, twice. I enjoyed this with some sugar free maple syrup. Now considering making more, and refrigerating it to make pancakes for tomorrow...so many bananas, so many recipes to try."
2001827830,501408,2017-11-27,5,"This is a great GF recipe, and what I loved was it did not have too much of a banana taste. If you've processed the bananas instead of mashing then you will not have the correct consistency. I've added touches of cinnamon when I want it to be a bit more of a French Toast taste; peanut butter to add a bit of fun, etc. Love this recipe &amp; so glad I found it!"
2001878400,501408,2017-12-22,5,"These are amazing! my little man loved them! he ate them and was asking for more. I also had them. yummy! i added a little cinnamon to the batter and made fresh whipped cream instead of using syrup. huge hit in my house and can't wait to make them again! i did learn that spraying the pan, even though its a Gothic non-stick pan, is very important. After that, they were easier to flip. I had to leave them in the pan on medium heat for a little more than a minute to get them cooked enough to flip, instead of 30 sec like the recipe said. again, we loved them and can't wait to make them again!!"
2001953175,501408,2018-01-25,2,Wouldn't stay together impossible to flip...this one is disappointing
2001985409,501408,2018-02-11,1,An inedible mess and a ruined pan.
2002029045,501408,2018-03-04,1,Tasted like a banana omelette....
2000040925,501408,2018-03-08,5,"As I read the title of this recipe, I must admit I was skeptical about it really resembling/tasting like “pancakes”. I read through each review, tweak, and decided to try it first with just the banana and egg, and the next time with a bit of cinnamon and baking powder added. Both were yummy, hit that crave for a pancake! I do enjoy the “tweaked” version better. (Fluffier). They are sweet enough to forego syrup, sweeteners. This is perfect for the crowd looking for gluten free, low point alternative (zero freestyle point/weight watcher) pancake. If you are accustomed to eating pancakes made with flour, it should be no shock that these would be different. Move on people."
2002151096,501408,2018-05-13,0,"I have Ulcerative Colitis and strictly follow the SCD lifestyle, which is completely grain and refined sugar free. I'm always looking for ways to meet my caloric intake for the day and these are amazing. I used an immersion blender to whisk the eggs until they were slightly frothy, added the banana and a few tablespoons of finely shredded coconut, then continued to blend until smooth. Turned out great and I didn't need any additional syrups or sweeteners!"
2002084634,501408,2018-05-16,0,Have been making it for quite some time now. Grandchildren love it - so do the rest of the family!
2001091055,501408,2018-07-16,2,"I really wanted to like these. The consistency is too wet and I only used a 1:1 ratio instead of 2 eggs like the written recipe. I ended up adding milk, baking powder, and flour (sparingly) and they couldn't be saved. :("
2002221438,501408,2018-07-17,1,That was the grossest thing I’ve ever made. It tasted like sweet eggs. ??
2002269212,501408,2018-09-08,0,My sister gave me this idea and I decided to try it today. It is quick and easy and the result is very good. I added some uncooked oatmeal to the banana and egg mixture and let it sit for a few minutes before proceeding to cook the small pancakes. I used ONE egg and ONE medium banana.
44420,30131,2007-08-03,5,Why haven't I reviewed this before?  I've used it on both chicken and steaks and it is a terrific marinade.  Thanks for posting.
440324,30131,2012-10-29,5,I used it on shrimp and even though it turned them a bit brown they tasted great. Can't wait to try it on some beef. Thank you.
136997,269156,2009-02-09,4,Very nice marinade. I used it for Recipe #349333 :)
88342,42198,2003-08-04,0,"You shouldn't be recommending eating raw eggs without a serious warning.  The volumn of the ""BOX"" of sugar wuld be helpfull too."
37229,42198,2004-07-07,5,"Very yummy! I didn't realize my 8x8 pan was dirty so I had to use a slightly smaller dish and less strawberries and cream as a result, but it turned out wonderful! I took it to my inlaws for 4th of July and there was almost nothing left! I only had 2 cups of powdered sugar and it was almost too sweet. I'd definetly not use a whole 16 oz box. I will definetly make this again! Sooooo Good! Thanks for the recipie!"
35526,42198,2004-08-02,4,"I used a half a box of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Not sure what happened but alot of the vanilla wafer crumbs never got wet enough to be a part of the dessert.  Loved the taste though as did  my guests.  I will be making this again but will experiment with the sugar, egg and butter mixture to make it a little runnier maybe."
195984,42198,2005-02-15,5,I have looked for years for this recipe. My aunt made it when I was a child and I loved it. I thought it was called French Strawberry Pudding. I tried to make it from the memory of watching her. It was the eggs I left out. Thanks so much.
545717,42198,2008-05-17,5,"Delicious! The only change I made was that I used egg substitute in place of the eggs, it worked fine. Thank you for sharing this refreshing dessert."
85018,59050,2003-07-11,4,"Couldn't find Lorna Doones, so I used pecan sandies.  Used less than the3/4C syrup, 'cause it looked like it would be too wet.  Also, used brown sugar just because I love the flavor.
This was very good.  We all liked it, small pieces 'cause it's very rich with the Pecan Sandies."
39835,59050,2003-07-12,5,"Excellent and so easy to make. This can be easily classified as an ""emergency desert"" to have when people drop in. Thanks Vicki for posting this recipe."
97010,59050,2003-08-02,5,Another easy winner!  
13593,59050,2008-08-02,5,"I made this a few years ago from the very same newsletter Vicki found the recipe in.  I was answering a recipe request and wondered if this recipe was somewhere on RecipeZaar.  It was!  This is such a delicious, easy cobbler.  I think anyone would like it."
108843,236346,2007-10-13,5,"A great proportional recipe for those of us who live alone. I will add it to my For two Cookbook. I used slightly less butter, as I had some leftover buttermilk that I used for this! It was great!! Next time I have company I want to impress, ahem,  I am gonna double this one, and I bet it will be perfect. Thanks for posting this one, 462. I hope you don't mind me using your first name!"
37779,236346,2008-03-02,4,"I picked this recipe for my step-son, who loves mashed potatoes and thinks they are hard to make.  Used two large potatoes and kept the remaining ingredients the same.  The only thing I would do differently is thickly slice the potatoes so it easier to tell when they are done. The end-product turned out well and my step-son can now make mashed potatoes whenever he wants them. Thanks."
913935,236346,2008-08-28,0,"This is a good one but, when adding the water to the pot, just cover the diced potato. And also use cold water to start for even temp when cooking. Also for those of us who want less fat, I recomend using molly mcbutter for that wonderful buttery taste without all the fat."
37449,236346,2011-05-03,5,"I left the peel on to get more vitamins, and sliced it to cook quicker. Easy, quick and very good! Thanks!"
1803179896,236346,2014-09-28,2,Add the milk slowly until you get the desired consistency.  If you just dump in 1/2 cup milk you&#039;ll get very bad results unless you have an unusually large potato.
763736,301835,2008-08-26,5,"Easy, quick, and delicous!  I used a can of peaches in heavy syrup, and chopped them up to a smaller size.  A full 5 stars from me.  Thank you!"
488441,301835,2008-09-02,5,"Fantastic! This will be my new go to recipe for desserts. This is so easy and tasty. I did have a problem trying to decide what temp the oven should be since it says 45 minutes but doesn't give a temp. I baked my cobbler for 65 minutes in a 350 degree oven. I checked it every five minutes because I didn't want it to burn or get too brown. This is a great, easy, inexpensive recipe, and I always have the ingredients on hand. I think you could use blueberry pie filling or others to switch it out a bit. Thanks so  much for posting."
727055,301835,2009-03-27,5,"Oh what a delicious way to use up that stray can of peaches that got lost in the back of the cupboard! This was so quick and easy. I used a large can, 29 oz., and drained the extra juice. I also lightly greased an 8x8 baking dish and this fit exactly. I thought there was going to be too much topping, but after baking, it was just perfect. Served this with cool whip or vanilla ice cream. Made this for Spring PAC 09. Thank you for sharing , this made it into my keeper file!"
614514,301835,2009-09-17,4,"This was good and super easy, but too sweet and buttery for my taste. Next time I will try decreasing the sugar and butter and increase the flour a bit. I used fresh peaches which worked well. The bake time was perfect."
458757,301835,2012-05-14,5,This was great and so easy!!!  Thanks for a great easy recipe!!!
119466,155496,2006-07-03,5,"I typically don't like potatoes ""baked"" in the microwave, but don't always plan far enough ahead to bake them in the oven. This is a very nice compromise. The microwave time will probably need to be adjusted according to the size of your potato and wattage of your microwave. Thanks for posting! "
51011,155496,2006-08-17,5,"I was really in the mood for baked potatoes from the oven tonight but didn't want to wait forever.  I cooked 3 potatoes (2 for tonight, one for lunch tomorrow) in my microwave on the baked potato setting (almost 12 minutes).  Then I cooked them in a 400 oven for 20-25 minutes.  Yum!!!  Tasted like I had cooked them for longer!  This will be a keeper.  Thanks for sharing."
327445,155496,2006-09-26,5,"I was very impressed with this. I put 3 potatoes in the microwave for about 10 minutes, then brushed on some oil with garlic powder, wrapped them in foil, and put them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. The inside was soft and moist, but the skin was a little chewy. Topped with chili, cheese, sour cream, and broccoli. Yum!"
104295,155496,2007-06-27,5,This worked out beautifully.  I almost never have baked potatoes because they take so long to bake.  But this was lovely.  I did three potatoes and then we had a baked potato bar for lunch.
93997,155496,2007-09-18,5,"These turned out great. Great way to cut the cooking time. You can also do them in the microwave entirely and they are pretty good that way as well. But I thought this method taste better than simply microwaving. Thanks for the recipe, will make again!"
789388,155496,2008-03-14,5,"I was getting ready to post a review for this recipe, which by the way I've used for the last two evenings. And noticed I'd been skipping a step!!  LOL!!
So I can safely say, IF you want to pass the ""brush with olive oil"" step, they will still turn out light, fluffy and wonderful. 
i don't know if it makes a difference but I used Russets. And I will tell you without a doubt I will never back a potato any other way again. Except, I might try the ""brush with olive oil step"".  LOL!!"
864044,155496,2008-08-01,5,"I have made my potatoes like this for years. But I don't brush them with olive oil, I just pop them in some aluminum foil and stick in the oven while I'm grilling the steaks or fixing whatever needs to be fixed."
166294,155496,2010-03-24,5,"So good!!  I tried these because of Marg's photo and review.  Why have I never thought of using the microwave first and then the oven??  I have always wanted that salty, crunchy skin but didn't want to wait an hour or more for oven potatoes.  I'm using this method from now on.  Thank you!"
124416,155496,2010-03-28,5,"Hmmm. . . I thought I was the only one who knew this sneaky little secret,  been doing this for years!  I just nuke the potatoes about halfway (I don't even use the paper towel) then oil or butter the skin. Sprinkle with Montreal steak seasoning if you like it.   Finish in the oven.  Or if there is a REAL time crunch, nuke to almost done and then continue as above.  Thanks for posting; I guess everybody should know this method . . . . Janet"
26512,155496,2010-03-29,5,"I've been using this method for many years. I do add onion powder, cracked black pepper and onion salt to the skin. This is a great recipe if your main dish needs to bake for 30 minutes or so. You can just microwave the potatoes for a bit less time and then toss in the oven with your main dish. I just toss mine right on the rack."
1535,155496,2010-04-15,5,"This was a great way to get a perfect baked potato in a short amount of time! My only problem was 8 minutes in the microwave was waaaaay too long for my potato. The first one was so shriveled up, I had to throw it away. For the second one, I used the automatic baked potato setting & it only took about 4 minutes for it to be done. So make sure you check your potato early! Since I was also making Recipe #50847 to go with our steaks, only having the oven on for 15 minutes worked really well. I loved how crisp the skin got because of the oil. In fact, once I was getting full, I scraped the rest of the potato out so I could finish eating the skin instead. It was excellent! I'll use this method often. UPDATE: This method also works well on the grill. I put my potato just at the edge of the coals and turned it halfway through and it turned out lovely!"
88099,155496,2012-01-20,5,"Oh gosh what a great way to have baked potatoes and so easily.  After microwaving mine, I brushed with the oil and lightly sprinkled with Kosher Salt and fresh black pepper.  Excellent.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for cookbook tag game."
211329,122497,2005-05-21,5,i wanted to let you know my children really enjoyed this and i also found myself sipping it again and again and i am not one for grape juice.  it just really had a nice taste to it.  thanks!
185105,122497,2005-09-29,5,"Oh!  We love this so much!!!  It's that ""special treat"" that I give my kids when they've been good!!!  Just like my Mom used to do for me....Great incentive for ""being good"" in my book!!!  YUM!  :)"
383346,204114,2011-12-17,5,This is a great healthy smoothie.  I used berry yogurt instead of plain.  Thanks kitsmomma :)  Made for Bargain Basement tag game
234062,16327,2007-04-01,4,"This was really good! A very unusual taste for spinach. It was quite sweet, but then I forgot to add the parmesan :0P! Never mind, it was really good and I'll certainly make spinach this way again! Especially since it's a creamy spinach without the fat of cream."
512309,16327,2008-10-17,4,"Very good, very easy, and much lower fat than a standard ""creamed"" spinach recipe!  I love yogurt to replace sour cream or heavy cream.  I didn't drain my yogurt, because it is pretty thick to begin with.  I used 2% plain yogurt, homemade, and one box (10 oz.) of frozen chopped spinach.  The kids didn't love this, but DH and I sure did!  Thanks, Sherry Karaoke!"
1353074,16327,2011-02-23,0,"I was very hopeful for this recipe, but it was a ""fail"" for me. :o(  It's only my fault for not knowing that if you put too much heat to yogurt it will curdle.  I used Greek yogurt and added it to my cooked fresh spinach, THEN (about 15 seconds later) turned the heat off.  I was bummed because creamed spinach is one of my favorites and this ended up like spinach with cottage cheese mixed in.  I'll try again, though!"
326348,127048,2007-05-28,5,"This sauce is excellent. I served it with deep fried turkey and my entire family loved it. The only thing I did differently was that for the raisins, in addition to the raisins I also added flaved craisans in orange, cherry, strawberry, cranberry, and dried mixed berries to equal the 1 1/2 cups of chopped raisins to give the sauce a mixed fruity flaver. Thanks for posting this recipe."

2001497454,127048,2017-04-19,3,"Use to make this years ago but lost the recipe. Thanks for posting it, so glad to have it back. This is one jam that really brightens the winter dinner table, when the green world is cold, gray and buried under the white of snow , and one of my favorites."
42824094,127048,2017-05-13,5,"I canned this about a year ago, put off eating it, was never sure if I wanted to deal with new tastes....don't know what I waited for, its so good, better than anything tomato based on the store shelf...I did add a little Apple Cider Vinegar for some twang, but otherwise this is just really, really good."
130663,353171,2009-11-12,4,Loved it and will make again trying different fruits.
315565,353171,2009-12-21,4,This made a lovely dessert . I had to cook mine lots longerand that is I think due to my choice of fruits. I used a mango and it was so juicy that it affected cooking time - but it tasted just great. I will try with berries next time. I love the fact that the variations are endless so Loula -thank you so much.
463435,353171,2010-03-18,5,"I really loved the simplicity of this dish and found it to be a true comfort type dessert. Not to sweet, which is a plus. I topped mine with dried cherries which sank to the bottom of the pudding, and then I added slivered almonds.  The combination of the two went so well together. I will definitely make this again. Made and reviewed for the Feb.-March./Special Event 2010 Potluck Tag Game."
163112,353171,2011-01-04,5,Oh yeah!  This is called clafoutis in other places like my house.  ;)  I used frozen/thawed/drained cherries with complete success.  It cooked up perfectly in the time frame given at 350F.  I love this recipe......it's all gone.  Made for Veggie Swap 1/11.  xo Bethie
11297,353171,2011-07-12,4,I loved this served with dollops of whipped cream on a cold winters day.  I made mine with drained canned pears and slivered almonds which worked well.  I will be making this again using other fruits when in season.  Made for Aus/NZ swap June 2011
1016189,353171,2012-05-06,4,"This was super easy and quick -except for the baking time of course. I used a blender to mix the batter, poured it into the pan, and topped it with fresh blackberries. This was very good as is, but next time I make this I will add some vanilla and either add more sugar, use brown sugar instead of regular sugar, or a combo of both sugars to make it a bit sweeter and have more depth -me and my mom thought it needed these changes, but my dad and brother both thought it was fine. I wish I had taken a picture before cutting it because it turned out very pretty. Also make sure you put this in the oven while it is still warming up, as part of the cook time, because if you don't you will need to turn down the oven temp at the end to get the custard to set (I baked mine for 15 minutes longer than called for and then turned it down to 300*F for 7.5 minutes)."
73836,60938,2003-08-19,5,"These were really very,very good.  I did not fry the potato skins, however, I chose to shake them in a plastic bag with a little olive oil and seasonings, and then baked them at 230*C for about 20 minutes,until crispy,then added the toppings.  I also used low fat cheddar and instead of sour cream for dipping, I used low fat ranch dressing.  Overall a winner!!!"
34879,11361,2002-12-10,5,"Hey, this is a good idea!  I need ideas like this!  When you don't have meatballs or time; this is perfect.  Thanks Bergy "
141147,11361,2004-05-13,1,seems a good idea but it didnt make a good meal and was very fatty
51011,11361,2004-06-09,5,"I have a secret- I can not make a meatball to save my life.  I found this recipe and decided to try it out.  What great results.  I addded half this to a container of spagetti sauce I was freezing for later, and used the rest to make meatball subs. Yummy and so easy! This is so versitile and could be used in many different dishes.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
23651,11361,2004-08-26,5,"I have done this for years, especially with the Italian sausages.  It's fabulous.  It's easy to lay them on a papertowel to drain the fat off.  The add them to any dish.  Great idea.  Thanks for posting it."
403665,193053,2007-01-08,4,"Really tasty! I actually chopped up some boneless chicken breast I had and threw it in with the rest of the ingredients! There was enough for 4 servings, but my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing! Thanks for the great recipe!"
41529,18766,2002-05-27,4,"Oh yum! This was great. My only problem was that I used Potato bread and ended up burning the bottom a little (but it was still delicious!), so my suggestion for white bread users is: follow the instructions above, and when the bottom is brown take the sandwich off and if the bananas are still intact, microwave for a couple of secs. :) Delicious! 2 thumbs up"
104295,18766,2004-06-28,5,"I was, frankly, surprised by how much I enjoyed this.  When you push the bananas down into the bread like that they break up just a tad and get all warm and creamy.  Along with the crunchy wheat bread this is excellent and very healthy!  Thanks!"
138047,18766,2004-06-30,5,"I've been doing this for years but not in a griddle. Thanks for the idea!  I've always put it in the sandwich toaster, with some brown sugar sprinkled on top of the bananas and cinnamon.  My kids love it!!"
27395,18766,2005-07-03,5,"This was REALLY YUMMY! I kind of combined this recipe with my Cottage Cheese Banana Breakfast Delight #17475 by adding cottage cheese and sugar substitute to the top after letting this cool just a bit. Thanks for a great new (and healthy) breakfast idea!
~Manda"
230258,18766,2006-04-12,5,"Fantastic!! This was really simple but delcious! I really like the way you prepare this. I almost just sliced the bananas and put cinnamon on them but then i ran back to my computer and I read the directions(not just the ingridents this time!)
Thanks for the recipe!"
227652,18766,2007-06-14,5,"So yummy!! I usually toast the bread, sprinkle with cinn/Splenda & cut up a banana to go on top, but this brought it to a whole new level. The bread was nice & crispy, the banana was warm & sweet-can't say enough good things about it. Came together in a snap, too. Thank u for the good directions, too-always helps!"
308765,18766,2008-01-01,4,"Good diabetic breakfast element for DH, we just learned he is diabetic a week ago. Thanks."
556453,18766,2008-01-11,4,"When I don't know what to have for breakfast, this is what I have!  With some milky Chai tea, it makes a pretty satisfying meal.  I usually shove a whole small banana on there...love bananas.  If I need it done quicker than quick, I just use the toaster oven and smoosh the banana into the bread with the side of my knife.  Yum."
17803,18766,2009-05-11,4,"This is an easy and fast snack to make.  It may also have health benefits, as it may improve blood glucose and cholesterol levels in people with Type 2 diabetes.  So I always give my cinnamon container an extra shake on my food.

832887,18766,2013-02-18,5,"What a treat!. This is easy, quick, healthy, inexpensive and delicious so five stars from me. I used homemade wholegrain bread which is a bit more robust - the bananas didn't smush in very much. I flipped my slices instead for about 20 seconds to soften the bananas -- delicious!<br/><br/>Thank you for posting."
376986,18766,2013-07-30,5,"Easy, tasty, and quick."
542159,449768,2011-08-21,5,Half sun-dried tomato and half tomato jam that makes a tasty topping for warm toasted French bread. Made half using the cumin option and half using the cinnamon/ paprika option using very large tomatoes which were just right at 10 hours. We all voted for the cumin ones and that will be the only ones I make in the future.  Thanks for the post.
428885,432077,2011-03-02,5,"Very simple and VERY good! I was able to put this together for a quick lunch, and followed the directions exactly. Added a bit of chopped bright red tomato on top, and devoured. Really yummy on a cold, farm day! Thanks for sharing! PAC 2011"
152178,323262,2010-01-15,5,"Okay, so maybe this isn't the recipe for all the chili snobs or purists, but it went over great with my family. Maybe it should be called beef and bean soup? Anyway, these simple ingredients came together for a wonderful tomatoey (is that a word?) blend. I used the mild chili seasoning mix since I'm a wimp when it comes to hot stuff. My husband doctored his with hot sauce and declared it very good. The only change I made was to add chopped onions to the ground beef while browning it. I used Bush's original baked beans and it seemed to give it a sweet flavor. This makes a ton, but tasted even better re-heated. This is perfect for winter dinners, thanks!"
201581,323262,2011-02-19,5,"My measures were all wrong on this, yet it still turned out very tasty: 1.5 lb ground beef, 2 18 oz cans beans, 46 oz V-8, chili seasoning 2.2 oz. Sometimes you need to make do with what you have. Perfect 'peasant-style"" chili, and macaroni added to leftovers will make another great meal. Thanks for the double meal recipe.

1105991,345089,2009-04-12,5,We loved this really different style of creamed corn.  my little girl could get enough of it.  It was easy and tastey!  Thanks for posting.  Made for Pick a Chef Spring 2009.
627002,345089,2009-11-03,5,This corn is absolutely fantastic! And very easy to make also.  When broiling the cheese topping you need to be very careful for if it's browned too much it is tough and chewy and hard to cut. The corn is also great on its own without the cheese. Thanks for posting this recipe. I`ll be making it for Christmas dinner this year!
2511882,345089,2012-11-19,5,Outstanding receipe - Very festive and goes great with Prime Rib !
2001938045,345089,2018-01-17,1,Absolutely disgusting. I followed the directions exactly as stated and it was terrible. The texture was way off and heavy cream in corn? Ugh. I really don't know what to say other than I couldn't eat it.
2002333222,345089,2018-11-15,5,Absolutely love this recipe! Simple easy to follow instructions. One of our family favorites for the holidays! Great for those following Keto lifestyle (use coconut or almond flour) I Have shared this recipe with quite a few family and friends! You won't be disappointed!??
41307,30300,2002-10-25,5,"I just tried this recipe and love it. I'm a diabetic and this is a great snack, low in Carbs.
Thanks for sharing it.

William"
14410,30300,2004-03-05,5,"Thanks for a great snack. I, too, am diabetic, so this really hit the spot for me. I used five-grain saltines, light mayo, lots of pepper, and a little salt to bring out the juiciness of the tomatoes. Delicious! My son, the junk food junkie, actually wanted to trade snacks with me, but I wouldn't go for it. I think I'm going to try a sprinkle of oregano, and maybe a little light parmesan next time. "
198228,30300,2005-04-06,5,"I love this!  I made a paste out of everything mashed together - I did not add any salt, but I did add a little garlic powder and parmesan.  It was wonderful!  Thanks"
139381,30300,2006-06-23,5,"MiniR,

I can see this recipe has not been reviewed in quite awhile.  However, I was going thru one of your cookbooks and discovered it. This has been one of my fave snack foods for year....exactly as you posted it!  And, all this time I thought I had created it...LOL!  Thanks for sharing a refreshing snack with everyone on Zaar.

107135,154224,2006-02-02,5, i love making this . it is very easy . i like adding mushrooms . thank you for posting this dee
173579,154224,2006-07-21,5,This was so easy to make.  We just loved it.  The parmesan in the middle added so much flavor.  Thanks for sharing.
176615,154224,2006-11-21,5,"Easy, fast, and everyone loved it. Skipped the pepperoni. Used 16 Kirkland (Costco) ravioli which are larger and were enough to fill an 11x7 pan. It sure beat boiling water and draining the ravioli. We'll definitely have this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
435683,154224,2007-02-26,5,"Loved this recipe, I made it for some friends as I was watching their kids at their house and took half home to my husband.  I made my own spaghetti sauce and put textured vegetable protien instead of using meat I am not a big pepperoni fan and everyone thought it was excellent, they couldn't even tell there wasn't meat, they thought I used hamburger!!  Great tasting."
268973,154224,2007-10-19,5,This was really great - easy to make and tasted delicious.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!
123964,154224,2007-11-19,4,"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, I love it! So easy, on a day when I have so much to do, this is fast and good. I have had it at the home of a friend, NOW I HAVE THE RECIPE!!! The best part is not having to cook the pasta first."
486718,154224,2007-12-03,5,The whole family loved this! My husband did ask if next time I could also add meat ravioli which I will as this one is a keeper!
705251,154224,2008-01-12,4,"My family loved this recipe!  We also omitted the pepperoni and used meat ravioli.  My DH and DD loved that it had a firmer texture than regular ""boiled"" ravioli.  We even had my DD's friend over and she wants the recipe to take home to her mom :grin:"
169712,154224,2008-01-13,5,"This really does work!  I did it without the pepperoni, and with way less cheese, and it was still super rich and filling.   My only problem was that after an hour at 350, the middle was still not quite cooked through, so I had to put it up to 400 for twenty more minutes.  Next time, I will try it at 375 for 45 minutes and see where that gets me.  Thanks for posting!"
199848,154224,2008-04-07,5,"I easily doubled this recipe in a 13 x 9 baking dish.   I assembled this in the morning, put it in the fridge and baked it later for supper, so my raviolis had time to thaw a bit.  The pepperoni was a nice little ""surprise"" for thne kids.  Thanx for a quick and yummy meal!"
425008,154224,2008-05-18,5,"This was really good, however I baked mine at 375 for an hour & they turned out perfectly! Very good & extremely easy."
58439,154224,2008-05-21,5,"LOVE this!
SO easy, do not give this a miss!
Doubled recipe, used 1/2 mini mozzarella, 1/4 fat free parm cheese!
On a cold winter's day, this certainly does please!
THANKS!
Omitted pepperoni, felt was healthier, TRUE!
THAT'S what I love about versatile recipes, as can slightly change without totally changing submitted recipe too!"
1072593,154224,2009-01-16,5,"Soup Fly, there's the good, the bad and the SCRUMPTIOUS.  Never in a million moons did the notion occur to me that frozen ravioli could be baked.  The addition of pepperoni was clever and added punches of flavor.  This was received so well that I'm already planning a repeat.  Oh, the ease of preparation is ridiculously simple...an absolute keeper!"
355637,154224,2009-01-25,4,Insanely easy!
1112060,154224,2009-02-22,5,"This was good and so easy! I used meat filled ravioli it was delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cook it a little longer. Our ravioli came out 'al dente'  but we would probably like it a little softer. Other than that, perfect! Definitely try this one."
783601,154224,2009-04-09,3,"This recipe tasted fine, but it didn't seem all that easier than to do it the old fashioned way. I checked mine at 30 minutes, and it was still cold. I finally took it out when it was warm and heated it in the microwave. Seems like a good concept, just didn't meet my expectations."
880866,154224,2009-05-17,5,This is absolutely delicious.  Very easy to put together and tastes much different from ravioli cooked on top of the stove.  Highly recommended.
1300155,154224,2009-06-18,4,"It was great, however, I would recommend increasing baking time. Mine was stone cold after 30 min at 350. I put it back in for 20 minutes at 400 after to cook it. I opted out of the pepperoni."
124190,154224,2009-07-03,4,Yum! Great easy recipe>.I too needed more time in the oven. But it was worth the wait! Will def make again. Thanks for sharing!
866963,154224,2009-09-20,5,I used this recipe for the method rather than the ingredients since I used my own sauce and baby meatballs rather than jarred and pepperoni.  Everyone was pleased with the results and it saved me time by cutting out the boiling step.  From making lasagna and other dishes I have found that if you give the tin foil a spray of PAM it will keep the cheese from sticking.
1663103,154224,2011-01-13,5,"You have to cook more like 45 minutes and to prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil just spray the foil with some cooking spray before putting on.  BUT...this is awesome, I leave the pepperoni out and just add 1 lb of hamburger to the spaghetti sauce."
1198738,154224,2012-05-23,5,"Super!!!!!   Doubled recipe, used cooking spray on the foil as suggested, and baked at 350 for l hour.  Perfect!  Would never have thought of doing this, and didn't really believe it would work, but am delighted with the results!"
309360,154224,2013-02-20,5,Omgosh I will never boil ravioli again this recipe was GREAT. Since it was only two of us I ended up making one layer in a casserole dish. I didn't have time to defrost the mozzarella cheese so I used frozen cheese with my frozen ravioli. I also used grated parmesan cheese <br/>(didn't have shredded parm) and just let it cook a little longer. . I also omitted the pepperoni because I didn't have any on hand.It was Delicious! I definitely will be trying this again
2715825,154224,2013-02-28,5,I LOVED this recipe. I added 2 slices of deli ham (shredded) and some sliced mushroom to my center layer. I also used medium cheddar instead of Mozzarella on this. It was extremely rich and i enjoyed it so much both my Husband and i went back for seconds. However we both agreed that next time i should definitely try the pepperoni and mozzarella! I can see this being a regular on our dinner table. I can't wait to make it again. Thank you!!
1708613,154224,2013-04-01,5,Excellent recipe.  I used meat sauce I had in freezer instead of pepperoni.  Did not put the mozzarella on right away.  Baked at 350 for 30 mins then increased to 400 and put on mozzarella and took off foil and baked another 15 mins.  So easy and very delicious!
345884,154224,2014-02-14,5,Wonderful!  And so easy and fast.  A keeper!
423780,154224,2014-02-15,5,"I have always used Crock Pot Ravioli #64138 by Bekah in the past but forgot to get it going this morning. So I am rating this for the method, which is wonderful. I used the ingredients from the crock pot recipe, adding the parm from this one and the results were fantastic. I baked it 45 min. @ 350. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks for saving my dinner."
37779,154224,2014-12-21,5,Perfect busy night meal. Used turkey pepperoni and a jarred mushroom merlot sauce. Delicious and so easy. Thanks for a great recipe.
305531,154224,2015-06-23,5,Such a simple quick dinner for a busy week night. My grandson devoured this. Thanks for sharing. Made for What&#039;s on the Menu tag.
1530765,154224,2015-10-20,5,"This is truly genius. The method is brilliant and it lends itself to whatever you want to add. We like cooked, crumbled Italian hot sausage instead of pepperoni, or just use my own meat sauce. It needs at least 45 minutes in the oven, though. You really have to rely on your own judgment here and think for yourself because everyone&#039;s oven is calibrated differently. This is comfort food at its finest, and reminds me of the DELICIOUS ravioli they used to serve in my high school cafeteria. Hey, don&#039;t laugh. I don&#039;t know about you, but we had some SCREAMING cooks at our school. Man, could those ladies cook! It&#039;s high praise indeed to say these raviolis are just as good as theirs."
2001118994,154224,2016-08-07,1,"Not really a recipe. It's frozen Ravioli, pre-made sauce and cheese...Make the Ravioli and sauce from scratch with some fresh ingredients."
2001433133,154224,2017-03-13,1,"This isn't a recipe. Its assembly instructions. To make this dish properly you need... 3 eggs 300g dopio zero 250g ricotta 125g mozzarella 2 tins pomodori Fresh basil Olive oil Garlic Parmesan And maybe some other things if you like, but having half a brain and a few taste buds might help."
1911882,154224,2017-03-27,5,Absolutely Delicious and so easy!
2001530133,154224,2017-05-10,0,"I do a variation of this. I use cooked ground beef &amp; the prego to make a meat sauce, follow rest of the recipe. Its so delicious &amp; easy peasy."
1175362,154224,2018-02-01,5,"Thanks for the great way to prepare a tasty, easy, impressive dinner in so little time with so few ingredients! I put it all in an 8X8 (2 quart) Corningware casserole dish and, because it was so deep, it did take longer to bake (50-60 minutes). Delish!"
2000659458,154224,2018-10-08,5,"Made this for my honey and his friend. They crushed it. I mixed the raviolis in the sauce before spreading in pan, otherwise made it just like the recipe. Next time I may try spinach and cheese ravioli for something different. They LOVED it as it was and I will add this to my rotation of meals! Super fast and easy."
2002328984,154224,2018-11-12,5,"I made this for the 2nd time today and my husband loved it again. I didn’t have the pepperoni so I thawed leftover meatballs and sliced them in layers instead. I also added sliced mushrooms (one of my favorites) and it was just as tasty with my adjustments. I need to take a large dish to a family birthday dinner, so I think I will take one vegetarian and one meat, easy to do with this recipe and something that will make everyone happy. This is going to become one of my Go-to recipes!"
560807,269443,2007-12-03,5,"I just tried this tonight. Sis and I were looking for something to pour over our fries for our li'l movie night, and this was perfect. I made a little too much, so when the fries were over, we just scooped the rest of the sauce and ate that plain! I added a bit of Tabasco sauce for an added kick, and it turned out great! Thanks a lot!"
39835,112648,2005-03-27,5,This was wonderful with dinner and leftovers will be great for breakfast and lunches. Although we skipped the nuts and dressing this was enjoyed by all. Thanks for sharing this keeper which we will be having often.
593927,112648,2012-03-06,5,"I enjoyed this more than I thought I would but it is not properly food combined with the bananas and for that reason and that I don't like bananas much anyway I would leave them out if I were to make this again. I used recipe#38413 in a greater quantity for the dressing and poured it over top rather than mixing it in, just before serving. I may leave the walnuts out as well if I make this another time. Made for Please Review My Recipe ~ ~ ~ from February 14th"
870705,112648,2012-05-21,5,"I used 1 banana, 1 apple and 1 can of Mandarin oranges and omitted the nuts.  I used the canned oranges because we like those better than regular oranges.  You didn't say what kind of salad dressing to use or if you meant the kind that looks like mayonnaise so I just used mayo.  It was great!  Just like a salad we have at Christmas except ours never had oranges.  Made for Please Review My Recipe cooking tag game."
936601,198343,2008-10-13,4,"Very nice.  DH loves anything banana and this was rated by him as ""a keeper""   I did cut down a bit on the cinnamon and allspice, delicious all the smae!  Thank you for the post!  Made for Fall PAC 2008."
313633,165438,2006-06-28,4,"This was a very nice cake. My family loved it. We made it with orange juice and topped it with orange icing. Thanks and we will make this again.




"
844554,165438,2014-04-16,5,Talk about a good cake! This one is it. Tasted so rich (probably all the butter and sugar) and it rose so high in the 9x13 pan. I&#039;m taking it in to hubby&#039;s work and I know they&#039;ll love it. Unfortunately I had to leave out the raisins because I didn&#039;t have any but it was still so good! Made for PAC Spring 2014.
130663,213681,2009-04-18,5,Very nice bread.I omited the nuts as hubby didn't want any.
9869,100864,2005-05-16,5,"I used granny smith apples..followed the recipe exactly as written and out of the oven came the most delicious apple crisp I have ever tried, love the crunchy texture and flavours. I served with a swirl of cream.
Comfort food at its best."
163112,100864,2005-05-19,5,"I made this with strawberries!!  The whole thing was gobbled up in a heartbeat.  I used about 4c of berries but next time will use at least 8c. Even my daughter who 'doesn't like fruit' loved it!  So fast, easy & delicious!!!"
122993,100864,2005-05-19,4,"I made this with apples. It was good, but the topping was a bit to crunchy...so we added some pats of butter on the top and that seems to soften it up a bit. I will make this again...I'll have to try it with peaches!"
58836,100864,2005-07-04,5,Had an abundance of peaches so decided to make this using them.  Turned out great.  Even better topped with vanilla ice cream! yum yum!!
91392,100864,2006-08-15,5,Used fresh peaches.  Just excellent.  Will use this recipe for the topping for any number of different kinds of fruit.  Looking forward to trying it with cherries.
119466,100864,2006-09-22,5,"I had been craving apple crisp, so I made this recipe as one of my choices for the Pick A Chef game. I scaled the recipe to half, using 2 Granny Smith apples and 2 Braeburns. It was delicious and really hit the spot--thanks for posting! "
168462,100864,2006-09-23,5,I made this as written except I added some pecan pieces on top of the apples. My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.
366118,100864,2006-11-19,5,This was really easy to make and really good. I cut down the sugar a bit. Thanks Hadice!
86318,100864,2007-01-15,4,"This is good, but I'm embarrassed to say I would have preferred cinnamon only, rather than the cinnamon/nutmeg mix here. I have enjoyed these same two spices in these proportions in a quick bread, so expected to like them here, too. The apple crisp is also quite sweet - this may have been my fault for not allowing for the sweetness of the fuji apples I used. Thank you for helping me define my preferences."
130395,100864,2007-09-18,5,What A Winner.I don't really care for Nutmeg so I subbed for Apple pie spice. Excellent recipe.
199792,100864,2008-03-31,4,This was a quick and easy crisp that everyone seemed to enjoy. It did not give me the chunky crispy oatmeal topping that I expected but it was nice. I only used a pinch of nutmeg but did go with the cinnamon. I used peaches and at this time of year it had to be canned. I will try it again with fresh. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
521211,100864,2008-11-08,5,I've made this apple crisp many times and love this recipe.  It's simple and delicious.
744939,100864,2009-02-14,5,I made this with fresh blueberries that I had frozen and it came out as well as if I had used fresh!  We loved this warm out of the oven with some ice cream on top!
723491,100864,2009-03-06,5,5 stars all the way for this yummy quick to make and even quicker to eat dessert.  We loved it with a big dollop of ice cream on the side!
1144987,100864,2009-08-10,5,"We found this to be delicious!  It took longer than the prep time suggests, probably because of the use of fresh peaches (which have to be peeled), but we all enjoyed the result.  It was not too sweet and was excellent with ice cream.  By the way, we do not have a pastry cutter but had no problem as we cut the butter into little pieces and then worked everything together by hand."
483932,100864,2009-10-19,4,Very good. I cut this in half and made exactly as written with the apples. Served with vanilla ice cream.
15521,100864,2010-01-12,5,"This was an excellent apple crisp.  I chose it because it served 8 instead of 4 or 6, but I will make it again because it was so good.  The flavors were jusr right and I liked that it wasn't syrupy.  The fresh apple taste came through clearly.  I used 7 large apples and it made 10 - 12 large servings for me.  .  Thanks so much!"
679759,100864,2010-04-15,5,We loved this recipe...the nutmeg really was a wonderful treat and not something I usually put in apple crisp.  Great recipe..thanks!  Going to try it with peaches when they are in season...maybe blackberries too!
274467,100864,2011-09-12,5,"I have made quite a few different apple crisp recipes and this one wins! Crispy, crunchy topping, not too sweet, not soupy or runny. Perfect. We ate it warm with whipped cream on top. Delicious!"
303700,100864,2011-10-03,5,So easy...will definitely try it out with Peaches next....YUMMM!
176615,100864,2012-02-05,5,"Excellent! Made this with apples and we loved it. The perfect amount of topping. Makes a large pan, therefore an excellent way to clear out the beat up apples from my apple drawer. Looking forward to the peach version next. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
226863,100864,2012-06-17,5,"I used peaches, and cut it down to 4 peaches.  So I used a smaller shallow pan, and loved the wonderful crisp!  I think I'll add some of this to my oatmeal in the morning and enjoy it in a new way!  Love it with vanilla ice cream warm from the oven.  Thanks for sharing!"
2148727,100864,2013-06-28,5,"amazing! so easy and so delicious, a household favorite:)"
2918668,100864,2013-07-27,5,I have been making apple crisp for years. Very seldom do I find a recipie I want to use again. This is a good one!
1162224,100864,2013-12-20,5,"Out of all the apple crisp recipes I&#039;ve tried, this is the BEST!!!!!!!  Great fruit to topping ratio and the topping came out nice and crunchy and the apples weren&#039;t mushy.  This is the only apple crisp recipe I will use from now on!!!!!"
2198343,100864,2014-07-02,0,We  used less sugar and no nutmeg and it was a delicious crisp.
2109227,100864,2014-10-19,5,"Delicious!  I split the topping from the recipe out into two crisps in smaller dishes, one with fresh sliced peaches and the other with apples.  Absolutely loved it, I did need to bake them 10 minutes longer to get the top super crispy....but that is just a personal preference of mine.  Try this recipe you will be glad you did."
1803677177,100864,2015-01-25,4,"I adapted this for a bit more flavor (we&#039;re serious about cinnamon! also, the apples weren&#039;t ideal but they needed using), for a lot less sugar, and for no wheat or gluten.&lt;br/&gt;I also changed the preparation method slightly: &lt;br/&gt;* For brown sugar, I substituted 1-1/4 cup stevia powder, plus 1/4 cup of molasses (added the molasses later, with the butter).&lt;br/&gt;* For 1 tsp cinnamon plus 1 tsp nutmeg, I substituted 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp white pepper. (This may have been too much, even for our spice-loving family, if it had all gone into the crumb topping.)&lt;br/&gt;* For 1 c flour, I substituted a half-cup each of almond flour and sorghum flour. (I could have just used sorghum flour or rice flour or all-purpose gluten-free flour, or even buckwheat flour, which goes well with oats. Don&#039;t try using coconut flour as a straight substitute for anything else ever, though; that&#039;s weird stuff, needs it&#039;s own recipe.) &lt;br/&gt;* When I sliced the apples, each set of slices got dumped into a bowl of water with lemon juice, right away, to keep them from browning.&lt;br/&gt;* Next, while the oven pre-heated,  I mixed the spices into the stevia powder -- before beginning to layer the apple slices. Before the first layer, a thin scattering of spiced sweetener powder went into the pan; then, after each layer was completed, another thin scattering on top. &lt;br/&gt;* Then, the flours got stirred into the sweetener, and the oats, then the molasses and the butter.&lt;br/&gt;I could have used less butter, as it doesn&#039;t take much of anything to dissolve the stevia powder, but I didn&#039;t, so the &quot;crumble&quot; was a little on the moist side.  It took a little work to keep it crumbly instead of forming a nearly solid crust (not that there is anything wrong with a solid crust! if anybody goes in that direction, though, remember to leave some vents so the dish can easily let off steam). It turned out pretty well! Next time, we will use more oats in the topping. Also, if we have some cranberries or blackberries, we&#039;ll add a handful or two of those and back off on the spices, for a different twist."
2000041789,100864,2015-03-05,0,so great
2942654,100864,2015-10-09,5,"I have been trying to find a great Apple Crisp recipe for years and now I don&#039;t need to look any further! It&#039;s so easy to make and memorize. Most importantly, it doesn&#039;t turn out soupy. The crumble is crunchy and flavorful. My friends loved it! I find that using Granny Smith apples for baking is best--especially if you prefer tart and sweet. Excited to make this one again and again!"
593835,100864,2015-11-02,2,"I carefully read all the reviews and thought, &quot;how could I go wrong?&quot;  This did not turn out for me as the others reported.  It was way too sweet.  Even though there was no sugar mixed with the apples, the 1-1/2 cups of brown sugar was too much.  The topping was not crunchy at all, it was almost dry.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a large oval Pyrex dish to bake it in."
2000645615,100864,2015-11-06,5,"Excellent and easy to make apple crisp.  Since it&#039;s just me and my husband, I divided the recipe between two disposable pie pans and froze one for later (we&#039;ll see how that turns out).  We&#039;re trying to eat healthier, so I made a couple of tweaks--for the flour, I used half whole wheat and for the butter, I used the Earth Balance Buttery Spread that works for baking.  It was delicious--I especially loved the flavors of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  My husband loved it, too--this one&#039;s a winner."
2000656899,100864,2015-11-08,0,"Sorry, this was one of the worst apple crisps I&#039;ve ever made. The crumble on top was just that a lot of crumble. I won&#039;t even give a star rating."
2000712172,100864,2015-11-25,1,I found this to be too dry. Will never make it again.
2000805160,100864,2016-03-23,0,"Wow! So easy to make, the best apple crisp!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I served it with vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce it was Yum!  The only changed i made in this recipe is the sugar, i add 2 tablespoon of mascuvado sugar and the topping 1 tablespoon only.  Its a keeper."
2001005709,100864,2016-05-09,5,"Excellent! I had a lot of apples to use up, and this did the trick. Very tasty. I'm not a nutmeg fan, so I omitted that, but that's the only change I made. The whole pan was gone in 2 days."
2001207659,100864,2016-10-15,5,I love that i change portion control My husband even helped make it
2001227692,100864,2016-10-31,3,"Fruit/Topping ratio very good. Taste, very good. Texture very bad. Loose and powdery topping. 1/2 cup butter, even well blend is inadequate. Needs minimum 3/4cup and optimally 1 full cup to coat and crispin dry ingredients. So dry that even additional baking time would not help!"
2001605700,100864,2017-06-30,4,The recipe is great EXCEPT for the nutmeg. Next time I will be omitting it. It's very overpowering in this recipe.
493093,100864,2017-07-01,1,I guess if you like gummy oats (like in an oatmeal cookie -yuck) you might like this recipe. Has a seriously large pile of sugar too.
2001652865,100864,2017-08-02,1,"I disappointed myself today as I tried to make this for a luncheon at work, so I was naturally in a hurry and I for got to use the brown sugar. So sad. So I am wondering if I just melt the brown sugar and add what dry ingredients I can get into the pan if that might work just as good."
2002099131,100864,2018-04-06,5,"I remember making nearly this exact recipe for a certain fast-casual dining establishment on the east coast that’s no longer in business. As the restaurant manager, I had to set the par for how many to always have on hand, and it never seemed to be enough. I’d get us set with a number that would do ok for a couple weeks then suddenly it wasn’t enough. These were the most popular item on the menu next to the chicken itself."
2002274032,100864,2018-09-13,5,Excellent recipe! So easy! So tasty!
400708,100864,2018-11-12,5,"Fast, easy and oh so good, I even made a HUGE mistake; forgot to put in the brown sugar and had dumped the mix on the apples when I remembered. Had to pull out the apples, add the sugar and then repour on top; whew - even with that big error it turned out delicious and my whole family loved it. Thanks so much for posting this wonderful fall recipe"
58038,37073,2003-08-27,4,These look just like french fries and are very easy to make.  A lot of options with the seasoning too.  2 Tbsp of margarine doesn't sound like enough but it is plenty.  2 yo DS loved these french fries and gobbled them up.  Thanks for the recipe.
169969,37073,2005-11-15,5,Everyone enjoyed these and I loved that they were so easy to clean up after than fried potatoes. I will make my fries like this more often. Thanks Dancer!
197023,37073,2005-12-03,5,"A fabulous low calorie, low fat way of enjoying “fried” chips!  Very easy to make, very clear instructions, very quick and together with ellie_’s Spinach With Sesame Seed Recipe #138862, they made a totally delicious lunch.  The weather had turned suddenly much cooler today, and I felt like some sort of comfort food, so I made just a quarter portion, which in step 9 I sprinkled with dried oregano and sage.  Thanks Dancer^ for sharing this recipe."
157136,37073,2010-04-05,4,"These were good.  We used oregano and I didn't like that flavor, my husband and boys did though.  I think next time I will add a little salt instead.  Thanks for sharing."
442988,280918,2008-02-08,5,"Thanks so much for mentioning this!  I don't know why I never thought of it, but I didn't -- and this was SO much easier and neater than frying it in a pan.  It wasn't just that I could avoid the splatter -- it's that I could do other things while the bacon was cooking.  Thanks so very much for posting this!"
17803,280918,2008-02-12,0,"I have the same recipe baked at a lower temp,  Recipe #187790"
345569,218648,2008-03-04,4,"These were gone within 48 hours, which must mean they're good because there were only two or three people eating them!  We have a similar recipe in my family, only ours is chocolate instead of peanut butter... this went over well, though.  VERY peanut buttery -- maybe because I hate measuring out gooey things like peanut butter, so I guesstimated, and I may have put in too much.  I couldn't find a 12-oz box of corn flakes, so I used 8 cups.  I got twenty good-sized cookies.  Thanks for posting!"
36079,206585,2007-02-04,4,I added some cocoa to this mix (two tablespoons) and came up with a delicious chocolate cheesecake that was very easy to prepare.  Note however that it's two 8oz packages of cream cheese (for a total of 16oz) not two 16oz packages.
469903,206585,2008-04-07,3,"This didn't quite work out for me...  I used lite cream cheese, made my own graham cracker crust and followed directions as noted being careful not to overmix - it seemed pretty thick to me but I don't make cheesecake often so I just put it in the oven. Oh, and I swirled some raspberry jam on the top. After 40 minutes it didn't appear much different, so I turned the heat up to 350 and baked for another 5-7 minutes until it was brown on just the very outer edges - it never did appear jiggly so I couldn't use that as a gauge. Waited overnight to try and it was  just ok today. Made for PAC Spring 2008."
98722,196264,2007-05-19,4,"This is a good idea for all that leftover zucchini.  I left out the sugar as my tomatoes were sweet enough.  We had it on homemade pizza, very good.  Thanks!"
1182736,196264,2009-07-19,4,"Great Idea for the zucchini, I added fresh herbs and garlic.  Be great for a quick meal later. Thanks a lot for another good idea."
32671,8606,2002-03-04,5,it is different and i think my family should like it
659896,8606,2008-10-13,5,Very delicious and easy in a pinch.  I would recommend adding some oregano and basil to the sauce just to make it a little more interesting.
197023,8606,2009-01-22,5,"I loved the sound of this mushroom sauce and was certainly not disappointed. I made it as the sauce to use in Linda's Busy Kitchen's Recipe #254585, which I was making a large quantity of to put in the freezer. So I made four times the recipe. Proportionally, I used less Worcestershire sauce: I appreciate the subtle flavour it adds but I am always wary of its heat. I used Aldi's canned,  chopped Italian tomatoes (the best around) and I added three leeks as I love the blend of leeks, onions and garlic. I also added some rosemary, sage and thyme as we love that blend. This was a really delicious sauce and one I'll be making again. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Claire."
861336,8606,2009-12-28,5,"Love this recipe. Quick, easy and delicious."
5060,8606,2010-03-27,4,"Very tasty sauce with the mushrooms, parsley, garlic and onion, the combination adds lots of depth to the tomatoes.  Love the touch of Worcestershire sauce and I used lots of pepper.  I cut the oil down to just one tablespoon, a quarter cup seemed like a lot.  Worked out just fine.  Served over spaghetti with turkey meatballs.  Loved how quick it was to put together and will be making it again, thanks for posting."
1346465,8606,2010-05-21,5,"Wow ... this is seriously good. I added about 1/8C white wine and 1/2t of Italian seasoning during the simmer, but the recipe probably didn't need them. By the second or third bite, you're hooked!"
1928133,8606,2011-06-09,4,This is the first time I tried to make spaghetti and I am very sure that it will become one of the usual suspects during a time and taste crisis. My parents and sister liked it so much that they actually told me that I had become taller even though I stopped growing a couple of years ago. I am usually very critical about my cooking but I have to admit that your recipe made me feel like a decent cook. Thanks a ton.
239706,8606,2011-12-24,5,"I was in the need for a quick sauce tonight, and this one fit the bill since I had all of the ingredients. I was so pleased with it. I added some fresh oregano and thyme which I had growing in the garden. I also added a pinch of sugar to counterbalance my not-so-fresh tomatoes. I think I will add white wine next time as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for the perfect recipe. I'll definitely do this one again!<br/><br/>Revised 8/23/10 -- Just cooked this sauce again. This time I used fresh garden tomatoes and a white wine I had in my fridge. I again added fresh oregano and also a little fresh basil. Boy was this good! I'm not much of a cook, but this would be a good recipe for guests. Can I add a sixth star?"
464080,8606,2013-05-02,4,"I had a cup of diced tomatoes and 8 oz of baby Bella mushrooms in the fridge is this fit the bill.  Mine was very watery and a bit bland so I added a little white wine, a pinch of sugar, some Italian seasoning and simmered it for almost 40 minutes to dry it up a bit.  Since it was watery I chose to serve it atop some truffled polenta.  The combo of the two was four stars (the truffle flavor boosted the dish) but the sauce alone would be 3 in my book."
424680,301951,2008-05-24,5,"Great tasting jam/spread/sauce, whatever you want to call it & however you want to use it! So easy & wonderful! Definitely keeping this around so I can make some of the other variations, too! [Tagged, made & reviewed for the Summer Salad & Berry Recipe Challange]"
252514,301951,2011-08-07,5,"This makes a nice tasting, tart jam. And it comes together very FAST! I didn't strain out the raspberry seeds as I had this on wheat toast and it was fine that way. But if using as a sauce for ice cream, I would probably go the extra mile and strain out the seeds. Thank you, JackieOhNo! [Made for the All You Can Cook Buffet special]"
542159,301951,2011-08-25,5,"Wow this really is the best thing since sliced bread! There are lots of things to love about this recipe, it tasty great, it's easy, it makes just over a cup and has lots of yummy variations. I made strawberry and am looking forward to trying the other flavors. Thanks so much for the post."
578177,311959,2008-07-21,4,Another good recipe from SI!  I made two bags and plunked them in the freezer.  This weekend I put one bag in an 8x8 pan and baked.  The texture was dry but the taste was good.  Next time I will bake with a foil cover.
779751,311959,2009-01-20,5,Awesome recipe!  This is one of my favorite baked bean recipes ever.  We served this at my DH's 60th surprise birthday party and it was a huge hit with everyone.  I
1804431,311959,2011-01-31,5,I cant get my hubby to stop eating it!
243533,136112,2005-09-16,5,I thought it called for too much cheese but made as directed and we all enjoyed it immensely.  Don't have Brie often and that was a ncie addition to the asparagus.
240832,136112,2005-09-18,4,Made it exactly as directed. Might cut back just slightly on the amount of cheese (just a bit too much) but the overall taste was great. Great Sunday dinner addition!
199848,136112,2013-04-16,4,"Really cheesy and good.  Almost too much cheese as written, though (maybe a typo?).  I used 6 oz of each of the cheeses listed and that was plenty.   I only cooked the asparagus for 3 - 4 minutes before placing in the oven.  Ten minutes would make the asparagus too soft and mushy.   Thanx for posting this!"
468351,497150,2013-11-09,5,"Quaker has changed their oatmeal cookie recipe over the years, which all have been pretty good!  I like this one!  It is a keeper. It is simple, delicious, and most importantly to DHs liking.  :) The only change I made was; instead of using all butter in the recipe, the full 7/8s cup of butter, I used &frac12; cup unsalted butter (1 stick) plus 6 tablespoons of buttered flavored Crisco.  A perfectly delicious cookie!"
393426,274746,2008-01-04,4,This was pretty good.  I substituted a few thin-sliced onions for the cheese.  The only thing I would say is that it definitely took the pototato longer than 1:30 to cook.  I think i ended up cooking mine for about 3:30.
369715,274746,2012-09-25,3,I used four red potatoes and doubled the rest of the ingredients. These were good but real greasy. I would cut the oil in half next time. Mine also took a lot longer to cook. I had to cook mine for fifteen minutes. I topped it with some cheddar cheese which added to the grease too but they tasted good.
1911882,496213,2013-05-10,5,I had to try these! these were honestly pretty good! I did use apple cinnamon instant oatmeal added some chopped pecans. for only having two ingredients these defiantly helped my craving for a cookie...lol without the guilt! I will make these again!
2882644,496213,2013-06-29,4,"As a diabetic this recipe really intrigued me.  I must say it exceeded my expectations.   I like my cookies a little sweeter, so I will add a little Splenda or (pure/organic) honey to sweeten them up.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I give them 4.5 stars, but the real test will come when my grandkids try them."
1802849661,496213,2015-08-31,5,Great recipe and so simple to make! Perfect for snacks or breakfast on the go!
1802738659,496213,2015-11-11,4,"These should not be considered &quot;cookies&quot;. Really, this recipe should be called &quot;build your own energy bar/snack recipe&quot;. I&#039;ll make this again, but probably as a bar, and with more add ins. As-is, it&#039;s very gummy, and a little bland...and I added peanut butter and sugar on top! It&#039;s all good as long as you&#039;re not expecting this to be a cookie or a dessert. Still, it was easy and fine for my tastes."
2001744935,496213,2018-03-09,5,"Loved these ... and I love good health ... and easy things ... made these smaller, added cinnamon. Made in my toaster oven. Deliciously easy and plain."
80560,20238,2003-04-14,5,"Very easy to make if you know how to separate eggs and beat egg whites. Fortunately, I do :) My wife and I ate the whole souffle for dinner by ourselves."
117781,20238,2004-05-28,0,"Honestly, this souffle is absolutely delicious.  Although, the ingredients make a fantastic dish, the instructions need a bit of work.  If a person had never made a souffle before, this recipe would be a disaster. It needs to be clear that the egg whites need to be whipped in a separate bowl to a stiff peak and that the yolks should be whisked together in a larger, separate bowl to allow room for incorporating the cheese sauce and egg whites.  To avoid scorching the cheese sauce, it needs to be stated that the butter should be melted over medium heat before adding the flour and that the flour should be whisked in thoroughly with the butter. I did not let the butter/flour mixture cook very long before adding milk that I had warmed in the microwave which helps avoid the lumps you get if you add cold milk.  If you incorporate the milk in small batches and whisk thoroughly each time, it yields the smooth sauce necessary for a souffle.  There is no mention when to add the salt, so I added it into the cheese sauce mixture along with fresh ground pepper and a pinch of garlic powder.  Before adding the sauce to the eggs, they need to be tempered so as not to scramble them. I whisked about a 1/8 cup of the warm cheese sauce into the egg yolks to temper, before whisking in the rest of the sauce. The egg whites should be folded in very gently in two batches so as not to lose the air you have just incorporated.  Also, to get a tall souffle that does not spill over the sides, take a strip of foil and butter it. Wrap the foil around the souffle dish (butter side on the inside) like a collar that will stand a good 6 inches or so above the souffle dish. This really did take exactly 30 minutes to bake. The urge to open the door and check it should be resisted so as not to have the souffle fall too early on.  It comes out beautifully and it is absolutely delicious, with a nice cheese flavor in each fluffy bite. It melts in your mouth and is just wonderful.  I sprinkled with chives before serving. Imagine my surprise when my picky 2 year old wanted to try it and ended up eating more than I did.  With these instructions added to the recipe, I would rate this 5 stars!"
59064,20238,2005-08-06,5,"This was my first ever attempt at any kind of souffle because it seemed perfect for a quick dinner in front of the TV with the kids.
It is very easy to prepare as long as you assume that the egg whites need to be well beaten. I didn't temper the eggs with the sauce and got away with it as I move fast! I have a small convection oven so I went for 23 minutes and then left the souffles in the oven for another 5 minutes."
99325,20238,2006-05-22,4,This is a good basic recipe. I can't wait to vary it!
254614,164100,2006-04-13,0,This is mine kind of recipe. Can hardly wait to try.
198971,429838,2011-02-27,5,"Excellent taste from a really simple recipe! I wasn't sure how the dried oregano would taste (we usually use fresh), but it turned out to be great. I think using butter to brown the onion, and adding the olive oil and basil only at the end makes a surprisingly good difference."
529571,429838,2011-09-25,0,"Great, simple, EASY sauce. I've been looking for a good simple, quick sauce for what feels like years and this is it! America's Test Kitchen never disappoints."
2689893,429838,2013-02-12,4,This is definitely a good recipe. Very easy too.<br/><br/>Try adding a splash of Burgundy wine after adding the tomatoes or white wine just before you add the tomatoes!
2906339,429838,2013-07-18,5,"I make this every time I make something that calls for tomato sauce and it is phenomenal. Just tart enough, just salty and flavorful enough. Amazing!"
2912533,429838,2013-07-22,5,"This is my new go-to recipe for pasta or pizza sauce. For decades I&#039;ve been using a recipe that relies on tomato paste, which meant that as long as I had a can in my pantry I could make a red sauce, but today all I had was crushed tomatoes. Boy, was that a good thing! My whole family agrees that this is a GREAT recipe, especially with the 2 T of fresh basil (which grow in a pot on my window sill year-round). I appreciated the note about the science behind the instructions and ingredients; it sure makes a difference. Make this! You&#039;ll be glad you did!"
185142,429838,2013-12-24,5,"So easy &amp; delicious! I used 1 tsp dried basil instead of fresh because I had none. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I served it over homemade pasta"
241385,429838,2014-01-05,5,"Made this in a pinch when I was out of store bought sauce.  Truly just 10 mins to make, easy and absolutely delicious!!! I did few variations, I added a handful of peppers I had on hand, used Muir Glen whole plum tomatoes (used immersion blender) and I like a really seasoned sauce so added a little extra seasoning. I will for sure be making this again!!!!"
1802704192,429838,2014-04-29,5,Quick and easy recipe I came across after discovering I was out of jarred pasta sauce.  No more pasta sauce for our kitchen.  This is my new &quot;go-to&quot; recipe for pasta sauce.
1802776261,429838,2014-05-27,5,Love love love this sauce. My daughter recently went vegetarian and is always wanting spaghetti. I don&#039;t care for the jarred sauce myself but still needed something quick and easy to throw together for her. This is it. Definitely a keeper.
1802887113,429838,2014-07-04,2,"I&#039;m experimenting with different sauce recipes to find &quot;the one&quot; that works best. This definitely registered as more of a sweet sauce for me. Maybe I was tempted to try this out since I was breaking a cardinal rule I&#039;ve heard from my significant other&#039;s Neapolitan mother: never, ever cook onions and garlic together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After breaking said rule and risking my life, I have to say I agree. The carmelized onions add a sweetness to the sauce that seems to register well with American palates. I wouldn&#039;t say this felt as sweet as, say, Papa John&#039;s pizza sauce, but nevertheless makes me want to try a nice red sauce with just a lot of delicious crushed garlic instead. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise, I think the suggested portions of spices worked out fine. I only added a pinch of brown sugar. Oh, and I felt this recipe was missing black pepper and added about a teaspoon or so."
2288695,429838,2014-10-29,5,I made this because I had no tomato sauce in the house but plenty of Muir Glen diced tomatoes.  This was so good I may never buy tomato sauce again.  The extra effort was worth it.
11154472,429838,2014-12-04,5,"I just made this a few minutes ago, I had no bottled sauce in the house.  I&#039;ve been meaning to make it, and my son just tasted it and then ate it straight up from a mug.  I will make this again,  and probably add a little wine as another cook suggested.  I used my imersion blender to smooth it out a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrific recipe."
1803540083,429838,2014-12-22,5,This was very quick and tastey. I added a can of red pepper diced Tamatoes to it as well because I like my sauce with more spice. I also added hot Italian sausage while saut
427184,429838,2014-12-28,5,"MUCH better then canned sauce. This will be a staple, thank you!"
2000449926,429838,2015-09-03,5,So yummy and easy! Added tomato paste and a bit more sugar but will be using this recipe again in the future
2000800890,429838,2016-01-05,5,"I first saw this on one of their cooking shows on making Chicken Parm. The sauce is a perfect balance, not too acidic, and SO easy to make! I learned that it really does come down to the canned tomatoes you use. My sauces before were always too watery. The bottled sauce we had been using had 7g of sugar to a 1/2 cup! So worth it to make your own! If you have a chance check out their Chicken Parm recipe - it&#039;s the best! (I sub eggplant for chicken.)"
2000819755,429838,2016-01-15,5,"Very easy, simple and delicious. I made sure to add the salt and pepper to taste."
2000821130,429838,2016-01-16,5,"Changes: did not have basil, used a generous sprinkle of dried Italian seasoning. Cook onion/garlic until very brown, simmer for at least 30-45 minutes. Follow directions!! This is imperative for the flavored to develop. My husband said, &quot;this is the best sauce I have ever eaten, WAY better than my mom&#039;s and I thought hers was the best!&quot;"
2155453,429838,2016-02-05,4,"Good recipe! I made a few changes to give it a little more flavor to my family&#039;s liking. Changes made include ... I followed the cooking instructions as given, added a few ingredients along the way. To the dry ingredients, in addition to oregano and salt, I also added 1/4 tsp tarragon, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and a pinch of black pepper.  I used organic crushed tomatoes w/ basil and instead of sugar I used 1/4 tsp of Sweetleaf (a natural zero calorie, zero carbs, zero glycemic response sweetener from stevia plant). After adding the crushed tomatoes and Sweetleaf to the sauce pan I added 1 TBSP of Marsala cooking wine. Bring to a rolling simmer, add 1/8 tsp baking soda, reduce heat to a very low simmer - cook for 30 min."
2000950147,429838,2016-03-30,5,"One of the fastest and easiest recipes I&#039;ve tried. My father had stopped by briefly on his way home from work and had one small bite at my insistence. As a result, he requested to take some back with him!"
2001281861,429838,2016-12-04,0,"Awesome sauce and so easy to make. I made 2 changes- I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. 2 I left out the sugar and used baking soda to neutralize the acid, making it taste sweeter. You don't need much, I used about an 1/8 tsp, maybe a little less."
2001540917,429838,2017-05-16,5,Love this recipe as did my family. Quick. Easy and so tasty. Made one little change used brown sugar instead of white. Delicious. Sharing this recipe!
2001486911,429838,2017-10-20,0,Can you can this pasta sauce Thank You Lynda Christian
2001801544,429838,2017-11-24,5,"I LOVE this sauce and use it every time I need tomato sauce. Works very well as a pizza sauce too! We ate it about every week.... So easy and quick and just soooooo delicious!! You can imagine that it tastes even better the next day, but delicious right away too. I usually add extra basil and garlic because that's just my preference. Using Muir Glen's organic crushed tomatoes really makes a huge difference!"
2001953552,429838,2018-01-25,0,Great recipe. Easy and best of all taste mmm good!!!
1527385,429838,2018-07-14,4,Good and zesty! Not bland like jarred pasta sauces. I added browned and seasoned ground turkey because I like a meaty sauce .
2002305063,429838,2018-10-27,0,"I used good can tomatoes, slice fresh garlic using a razor blade, if you like garlic try this. Excellent flavor."
38094,16391,2002-06-17,5,"Blueberry season is upon us.  I cooked this up at the same time I was making buckwheat pancakes.  The combination was wonderful! Good, fast and easy.  All one needs.  Thanks."
95743,16391,2004-07-11,5,This was hubby's favorite of the five blueberry sauce recipes I tried after picking fresh blueberries for this winter.  He thinks the cinnamon and nutmeg really complimented and sparked up the blueberry flavor.
384923,16391,2007-10-26,4,Very good! So easy to make and it was delicious on French Toast.
759732,16391,2010-03-03,5,"I made this with only the addition of 1/4 c water and 1 tbsp cornstarch to thicken it slightly, yet give it a nice translucence. Unlike other recipes that call for the addition of flour, this recipe truly is easy and the blueberry sauce tastes fresh and ""yummy."""
1642015,96064,2010-06-28,5,"THANK you!!! I don't always want to do a full-on batch of Hollandaise. This gives me interesting options to work with. The tastes (and recipe) are very good to begin with -- and I'm enjoying dithering with the ingredients.

I appreciate your post, greatly."
23424,96064,2004-10-27,0,"My mother made this same recipe for eggs benedict every Easter morning.  I remember eating this when I was 7 years old, that was 35 + years ago.  She gave me the recipe, and I still make it for my kids and wife's family every Christmas morning for brunch.  I do use hellmann's mayo though, and use regular prepared mustard, don't deviate from this recipe, it is perfect.  "
33588,96064,2004-11-06,5,"This is a 10 star recipe,we loved it and will make often.Thanks"
142583,96064,2006-01-26,0,"Not happy with this recipe, tasted like mayo. I thought I would try it, as I don't have a double boiler or blender.
I am going to get a double boiler. I didn't rate this because, it is only fair, to say this will do in a pinch, it is very creamy, and will suffice for people that are not ""foodies"".
 
New cooks, try it, easy, and similar to the real thing.

I did it with Hellmans, which may have added to the flavor of mayo, as it has it's own flavor."
223978,96064,2006-06-12,5,"This did the trick.  Great if you dont want to deal with the real thing.  I will use this again, it was very good."
27783,96064,2006-12-26,3,"This makes a very small amount of sauce and it really didn't taste or look much like real Hollandaise sauce does.  The mayo really is the star ingredient here and I think it tasted good, just not like Hollandaise.  I needed to add a lot more mustard and more lemon juice to balance the mayo."
124249,96064,2008-10-07,4,"I forgot to make the Hollandaise sauce for the asparagus that my son asked me to fix so I tired your quick recipe. I don't eat Hollandaise sauce so I asked him to rate it. 

Thanks Denise in da Kitchen. 

Bullwinkle"
465056,96064,2009-03-29,3,The mayo kind of overpowered everything else.  It really does not look or taste like hollandaise but it so much easier to make.  Its kind of like comparing Jello Cheesecake to a baked from scratch one. Not as good as the real thing but it will do.
206747,448832,2011-06-28,4,"Prepared this for Crafty Lady 13, to share her loss of beloved pet, Maxx.  I had a jar of lemon curd type gel which I had purchased at Lenox a good while ago, and used a Duncan Hines Golden Butter cake mix.  Certainly a snap to put together, but found some un-incorporated dry mix on top after baking.  Next time -- and I WILL do this again, will be sure that all of cake mix is evenly distributed over filling, and butter more evenly distributed.  All that said -- it was very tasty, and DH had an extra helping before he went to bed !   So sorry about your loss -- pets are never far from our hearts !"
424680,448832,2011-09-09,5,"I do enjoy making dump cakes (so quick & easy), & so easy to change the cake mix or the pie filling or even to additional things to the filling! I pretty much followed the recipe here, although I did increase the butter a little, then used a large-hole shaker to sprinkle the butter more evenly over the cake mix ~ Works like a charm! Thanks for posting the recipe! [Made & reviewed for one of my group mates in the current Aus/NZ Recipe Swap]"
329769,448832,2012-09-02,5,"A quick and easy and delicious dessert. 5 minutes prep and it's in the oven. I used a gluten-free cake mix (Basco brand Golden Buttercake Mix 470 grams) and 125 grams of butter. Not knowing if the dump style cake would work with the gluten-free mix, I mixed the cake mix and melted buter together and spread over the top of the pie apples. Served with vanilla ice-cream and this cake was a hit with my whole family. Reviewed for September Recipe Swap in the Aus/NZ Forum. Photos being posted"
170271,448832,2012-10-06,2,"it was ""okay"" but probably won't make it again.  really wanted a cake-y texture and this was just crumbly on top.  my kids will enjoy it."
548134,221942,2007-08-02,4,I made this with craisins instead of raisins...yummy!
412186,221942,2007-11-08,4,Had some leftover rice to use up and this was a great use for  that rice. Will make again.
359707,221942,2007-12-26,4,"Great way to use leftover rice from Christmas dinner! I actually used 2 day old rice from a Chinese place nearby. It worked wonders but I think it was a bit too sweet with 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time, I'll use 1/4 cup and made a binch more. I also left out the nutmeg and vanilla (by choice). Thanks for the recipe. :)"
464253,221942,2008-04-01,4,"I like how this recipe doesn't need eggs, cream, or butter. It's perfect to use up leftover rice. I did find it a tad sweet, so next time I would 1/2 the sugar. I used sliced dried apricots in place of the raisins. The spices were great, and it is a nice, light, rice pudding."
842342,221942,2008-05-18,4,"VERY GOOD! 
I used Splenda instead of sugar and cut the recipe to 1/4 cup Splenda."
2138695,221942,2012-01-07,5,"This was my first attempt at making rice pudding and it turned out Wonderfully!  I halved the recipe since I only had 1 cup of leftover rice, and added a bit less sugar - I used 2% milk and leftover Korean sticky rice (really similar to sushi rice actually) and the end result was thick and creamy and magnificent ^_^ This recipe's a keeper for sure!  And super simple to whip up in no time!"
2000126923,221942,2015-04-08,5,"I omitted the sugar and replaced some of the milk with a can of sweetened condensed milk. Turned out perfect!! Also no raisins, don&#039;t like them."
2001541961,221942,2017-05-17,4,I had a little less than 2 cups of rice. Adjusted quantities and hoped for the best. It turned out that there were some small bits of broccoli in my leftover rice. Good thing the kids aren't around any more! Made a fine dessert.
1803487068,338753,2014-12-10,5,This a great grilled cheese recipe. I haven&#039;t one this good in a long time.
23400,26420,2002-09-24,5,great recipe!! I used 1 1/2 TBLS horseradish and found it had just the right bite. And all the ingedients were staples I already had on the shelf so you can make it on a moments notice. I always keep a bag of frozen cooked shrimp in the freezer and this was perfect with it.
24386,26420,2002-11-11,5,Made this last night and it is great!  Made exactly to recipe.  Thanks!
55181,26420,2002-12-26,5,I made this for Christmas Eve.  All my family thought this was the best ever.  I have added this to my recipe file and I don't think I will ever buy ready made again.  So easy to make.  
41879,26420,2003-03-20,5,"This is a wonderful cocktail sauce, and so easy to make.  It's best made a little ahead.  We've had it with shrimp and with crabcakes.  DH even made it all by himself once!!!  Thanks, Darlene."
57939,26420,2003-03-23,5,FORGET THE SHRIMP! I used this as a cocktail sauce for crabcakes - it was wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly except eliminated the salt.  It was still perfect! My previous recipe was ketchup with horseradish.  Never again! This is going in my recipe box immediately.  Thanks Darlene
68727,26420,2003-09-13,5,Tasty stuff!  I used this sauce as a topping for crab dip.  I made this recipe with 1 TBS of creamed horseradish and added a dash of hot sauce.  DH commented that the sauce was very good.
33443,26420,2003-10-21,5,"Wow! What a great flavour! I used 2 tblspns of horseradish and added a zested clove of garlic. No need to ever buy storbought again, this was way too good and very economical to boot!"
54885,26420,2003-11-29,5,no more store bought for me. this was really yummy and so easy to make
116608,26420,2003-12-22,5,made this for shrimp it was so good we bought more shrimp the next day and had it again no more bottled sauce for us thanks will use over and over again angie
44383,26420,2004-12-28,5,Made this Xmas day for shrimp appetizers and it was fantastic and oh so easy to put together the day before.  This is a keeper staple recipe for me. Thanks!!
132383,26420,2005-06-06,5,This was so easy and simple.  Thank you so much.
118159,26420,2005-08-05,5,"This is the same as my own recipe, delicious!  Also great on fresh oysters.  Once in awhile I will use freshly grated horseradish for extra zing and have horseradish leftover for prime rib."
192581,26420,2005-08-22,5,"This was very, very tasty.  Flavor was excellent.  I used two (generous) tablespoons horseradish.  The texture is different from my favorite jarred brand, but this is so economical it's worth it!  The same no. of calories as my brand, too."
173838,26420,2005-10-24,5,"Measurements are right on in this easy to make cocktail sauce. I also added a dash of Tabasco sauce. Thanks, Darlene, for a great recipe!"
141816,26420,2005-11-04,5,I love this! I used wasabi instead of tradional horseradish. Gave it a nice bold kick. Simple and items on hand in most pantries.  This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!
169969,26420,2005-12-06,5,This was so easy to throw together and tasted so much better than store bought jarred sauce! I added a little extra horseradish because we like a little extra kick. Everyone raved about this sauce during dinner. Thanks!
1522598,26420,2010-01-23,5,Oh yeah!!  Perfect cocktail sauce!  Reminds me of Red Lobster's cocktail (which I love!).  I followed the recipe.
175824,26420,2005-12-26,5,"This was terrific. I will never again use store bought cocktail sauce again. I made this for one of my Christmas Eve appitizers. Everyone raved about the sause. I used slightly more than 2 tablespoons of horseradish, otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. Thank you for an easy and tasty recipe. This is a keeper. "
148316,26420,2005-12-31,5,"Yep - the bomb!  Quick, Easy, Tasty and Delicious - You couldn't ask for better - Picture it... it's New Years Eve - you're bringing the shrimp but the cocktail sauce you thought you purchased is no where to be found - quick to recipezaar!  This recipe is put together faster then you can say shrimp cocktail!  I will never need to purchase store bought cocktail sauce again! Happy to have found this little life saving recipe :)"
19198,26420,2006-01-03,5,Excellent and even better the second day!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe! 
129177,26420,2006-01-29,5,This is really good! It reminds me of the sauce that was used in those premade shrimp cocktails in the seventies and eighties. You can add me to the list of those who will never use storebought again! Thanks for the recipe!
279240,26420,2006-03-04,5,"Bethany, know the ones you mean!  I think they are called Sausea shrimp cocktails.  I use to eat 'em all the time.  
Well, made this sauce about 5 times now..guess I should review it.  Umm..  Love it!  I got for the full 2 Tbl of Horsie..and I'm a little heavy in my pouring of the lemon juice and worcestershire sauce - just my old taste buds.  Great sauce!  Eating it even as I type!  I buy bags and bags of the little frozen shrimp (prawns over here..)..make loads of sauce..mix it up, stick it in the fridge and nibble about a pound at the time! Wonderful!"
279506,26420,2006-03-28,5,"I noticed the sauce (store bought) we already had was out of date :( , so I had to hurry and make some before I go to work... I love it, and I hope my husband will.. I'll let you know ! Thanks !!!!!!!"
113941,26420,2006-04-09,5,"PERFECT!!!! I'll never have to buy it again!! I was scared to try this at first because of it calling for ketchup, I thought you had to use chili sauce! The ketchup worked perfectly!! I halved the recipe but did add 2 whole TABLESPOONS of horseradish! We LOVED it!!! Thanks SO MUCH!!!"
119466,26420,2006-05-01,5,This complemented our shrimp nicely tonight. I added extra horseradish and quite a bit of Tabasco. Delicious--thanks for posting!
231054,26420,2006-06-08,5,"This is the same cocktail sauce my mother used to make and I've been making it for well over 45 years.  The only difference is that I begin with Chili Sauce instead of catsup.  If you haven't tried it that way, please do.  I think it will make this excellent recipe even better."
228742,26420,2006-09-09,5,Great recipe!  I'm an absolute wimp when it comes to horseradish so I only used 1 Tablespoon of it and the sauce is perfect.  Thanks!!
103849,26420,2006-10-28,5,Super easy.  Tastes great. I didn't add the salt or pepper.  Hardest part was finding the horseradish in the refridgerated section at the grocery store.
242250,26420,2006-11-06,5,I love making my own sauces and this is definitely a keeper!
336058,26420,2006-12-23,5,"I just love this website!!!  Now I can make my own, healthy, cocktail sauce for the shrimp/crab dip for Christmas.  I used the catsup, 1 T horseradish, lemon juice and Worcest. and it turned out great.  I might use a little more horseradish next time.  It doesn't make 1 1/2 cups though, jus over 1 cup.  The sodium is 138.75 mg per tablespoon."
278113,26420,2006-12-24,5,Fabulous!! I will never use store purchased again!
367916,26420,2007-01-06,5,Good sauce! Just enough tang for us with 1 Tablespoon horseradish.
405655,26420,2007-01-26,5,Loved this recipe!  So simple and used ingredients I always have on hand. I have not been able to find a store bought cocktail sauce I like.
438966,26420,2007-01-27,5,Delicious! I used Low Carb catsup and added some Mexican hot sauce to give it a big kick.
146284,26420,2007-03-10,5,"This was way better than the bottled sauce from the supermarket, and especially convenient to whip up with ingredients I always have on hand. Many thanks for the great recipe."
138051,26420,2007-03-28,5,"I made this last night. I thought I had jarred cocktail sauce on hand, didnt. Hubby was out of sorts as we were having shrimp. I said, well, let me look on zaar. There is always something there.

You saved the day. We loved it. He said this is a keeper, going ummmmm!!

Thanks for a great recipe.

373817,26420,2007-04-03,5,"Very good! I used this to dip my fried shrimp in and it was perfect! I  only had some wasabi paste on hand, so I used that instead of horseradish, and it tasted great! Thanks!"
362734,26420,2007-04-11,5,"I made this without the Worcestershire sauce, as I was out, and it was just perfect. I'll try it with it next time. Thought it was much better than store bought. HK"
227607,26420,2007-06-01,5,Perfect...I cut the recipe in half and it was the perfect amount for our shrimp...I will never again buy cocktail sauce.  This was so easy and soo good.  Thanks for a great recipe.
452355,26420,2007-06-21,5,"Delicious, as well as fast and easy.  I'll definitely be using this as my cocktail sauce recipe!  Thanks for this keeper!"
250230,26420,2007-07-01,4,"This was sooo good, I will never use store bought again. Thank you for sharing!"
126104,26420,2007-10-12,4,"This was really good.  I whipped it up tonite to have with some crab as a snack, and totally enjoyed it."
88717,26420,2007-11-07,5,"This was very good. I followed the recipe except for adding about 4 drops of Tabasco, for personable preference. Thanks for posting. This was easy to make and made with ingredients I keep on hand.
I'm updating this recipe just to say that when I go to a resturant now I notice it's not near as good as this recipe. This has become our favorite, and I'm thinking of giving the recipe to our favorite resturant's owner. LOL~"
676529,26420,2007-12-04,5,"Loved it...loved it....loved it!!  I forgot to buy cocktail sauce at the store, so I looked for a recipe.  I will never buy store bought shrimp cocktail sauce again.  Thanks for the recipe. :)"
140806,26420,2008-01-21,5,DH LOVED this and has now vowed never to buy cocktail sauce from the bottle ever again! He used this recipe as a bed for Grandma's Clam Dip #37168 and he can't wait to try it with shrimp. Too easy!
743475,26420,2008-02-04,5,This is BETTER than store bought!!! THANKS!!!
302744,26420,2008-03-23,0,"Yet another rave review.  This is way better than any bottled cocktail sauce.  I upped the heat with close to 3 tablespoons of horseradish.  Another reviewer mentioned adding garlic, which I will definitely try with the next batch.  Yum!"
340776,26420,2008-04-09,5,"Delicious! As was suggested by some other reviews, I used half chili sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I used two generous tablespoons of creamy horseradish sauce since it was what I had on hand. It had a lot of kick and tasted excellent. I am going to make more shrimp tonight just to use more of this."
112489,26420,2008-05-07,5,Another great review for this cocktail sauce!  This was so easy and I won't ever buy cocktail sauce again.  Much better than store bought and I know what's in it!

188837,26420,2008-08-25,5,"very easy to make and delicious - I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice instead. Tastes just like the kind you buy, but much nicer to make your own, knowing what goes into it!"
937563,26420,2008-08-28,0,Best I've ever made. No salt or pepper necessary
546216,26420,2008-10-18,5,This is so easy to make and tastes so much better then store bought.  Thanks for posting!
26512,26420,2009-01-01,5,Excellent. I used a lot of horseradish and a bit more worcestershire. Thanks for the recipe.
1022468,26420,2009-01-09,5,Wow this was good! Definitely deserving of its rating!
1090141,26420,2009-01-10,5,"OMG, so good and incredibly easy!"
242642,26420,2009-02-14,5,"OH YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM
I never remember to rate recipes but after my fam and I GORGED ourselves I waddled back to the computer to say WOW.  SOOO much better than what they try to sell you in the stores!"
573772,26420,2009-02-18,5,Tasty and easy!
362892,26420,2009-03-18,0,The BEST! I mixed half catsup and half chili sauce for added flavor. We like horseradish so I went with the larger amount of horseradish ( 2T.). Thanks so much for posting:)
174991,26420,2009-03-22,5,Great tasting.  We used it with shrimp and everyone loved it.
1072593,26420,2009-04-10,5,"Not just for shrimp, delish with crawfish, too!"
1188379,26420,2009-05-05,0,Simply DELICIOUS!!!!  Thanks for sharing!
13705,26420,2009-06-11,5,I've been making my own cocktail sauce for several years now but never thought to add Worcestershire sauce.  It was a great addition.
445122,26420,2009-06-15,5,"Really good!  I used 1 1/2 tbsp horseradish and lime juice, just because I used my only lemon to boil my shrimp in.  I also used 1/2 cup chili sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup.  YUM!"
318235,26420,2009-06-24,5,Restaurant quality cocktail sauce that tasted delicious with the shrimp cocktail I made last night. I will always use this recipe from now on. It was so easy! Thank you.
231198,26420,2009-08-03,5,This was really good!  I planned on having shrimp for dinner but didn't realize I was out of cocktail sauce.  Your recipe saved my dinner!  Thanks for posting.
55392,26420,2009-08-06,5,Amazing! My 2 yo ate it more than the shrimp.
868626,26420,2009-08-13,5,Great tasting sauce for our shrimp!  We enjoyed it so much!
567380,26420,2009-10-05,5,This is so easy and delicious.  I will never by cocktail sauce again.  Thank you!
1350389,26420,2009-12-17,5,Excellent as written.
848507,26420,2010-01-04,5,Thank you! I made fried shrimp and had no cocktail sauce---this recipe was a life-saver!
301487,26420,2010-02-08,5,"This is incredible! I make an appetizer that is baby shrimp and cocktail sauce pored over a block of cream cheese and this sauce made it amazing. I have always liked the appetizer, but yesterday at my Superbowl party, all of it disappeared in record time! Thanks for posting this recipe. I added the full 2TBS of horseradish and I will never buy pre-made cocktail sauce again."
440324,26420,2010-02-10,5,Terrific!
449500,26420,2010-02-15,5,Excellent! I added about 1-2 tsp of hot sauce to make it spicier. Thanks for sharing!
171328,26420,2010-02-26,5,"Wow!!  It's perfect!  If everyone knew how easy it was to make Cocktail sauce, Hoffman's would be out of business!  Thank you, you just saved me a trip to the grocery store!"
817360,26420,2010-03-07,4,Pretty good cocktail sauce- but a bit bland for us. Next time I'll tweak it up for us. thanks for sharing.
158086,26420,2010-05-02,5,Great shrimp cocktail sauce...so darn easy I don't know why I bought it in a jar...
844554,26420,2010-06-04,5,It was perfect for us. I never buy the jar anymore and this recipe is a keeper.
423494,26420,2010-10-07,5,The flavors are perfect.  I added more horseradish to taste.  Never by bottled again!
333017,26420,2011-01-28,4,I was using up some prawns from the freezer and I knew that I would find a recipe here.  I wasn't disappointed!  The only change I made was that I only had 3/4 cup of ketchup left (opps!!)...used 1-1/2 T horseradish...a good shake of wort. sauce and a good pinch of my special pepper blend.  Yum!!  I would definately do this one again!  Thanks for the posting!
1890285,26420,2011-04-21,4,very good i defroster a pound of shimp and was out of sauce this was a life saver . Very good .
31807,26420,2011-05-03,0,Needs a lot more horseradish for my taste.
1920372,26420,2011-05-29,0,really good!  I will never buy bottled again!
1934824,26420,2011-06-18,5,This worked out great when we someone brought shrimp but no sauce. I did not have horseradish so I used Dijon mustard. which will work if in a pinch.
914720,26420,2011-10-19,5,This is nice to put together at the last minute to go with boiled shrimp.  Half a batch is enough for our family.  Thanks for sharing!
305531,26420,2011-10-26,5,This was a great cocktail sauce. Easy to make and went really well with shrimp. Thanks Darlene Summers for a nice treat. Made for Cookbook Tag.
445033,26420,2011-12-25,5,Best sauce ever!
18745,26420,2012-01-02,5,Excellent!  Needed a small portion (I halved the recipe) of this because I rarely buy cocktail sauce and when I do it usually doesn't taste good after it is in the refrigerator too long.  Very nice taste and you can make it as spicy as you like it.  I did add some tobasco sauce as we prefer a little extra spice. Yum!!
15521,26420,2012-01-21,5,This was an easy and tasty recipe.  Next time I might up the amounts of lemon juice and horseradish.  It was a little sweet for my taste and this might help cut that sweetness.
2638980,26420,2013-01-16,5,"This is a super easy to make sauce, I had all the ingredients right at home.  I used 2TBS extra hot horseradish and gave it a nice kick.  Thanks for posting Darlene!"
134624,26420,2013-02-10,4,"My family is attempting to use fewer commercially prepared items, and I was needing some cocktail sauce for later this evening. I literally just finished making this, and it couldn't have been any easier. It tastes so much fresher and cleaner than the supermarket variety; I can't believe I didn't try making this earlier. I made this using ketchup recipe #343611."
328542,26420,2013-06-24,5,"My husband dislikes horseradish and he enjoyed this sauce. Served with cod cakes. Halved the recipe, using 1 Tbsp horseradish, but still had extra.  Will cut it in fourths to make enough for only a meal."
429182,26420,2013-08-29,5,yum yum....definitely 2 Tblsps. of horseradish for our tastebuds!
693345,26420,2013-09-12,5,"Great sauce! I cut it down to 1/4 of the recipe, just estimating ingredient amounts that became too small to measure. So easy and tastes perfect! I am definitely keeping this recipe, thanks!"
959326,26420,2013-10-25,5,Very easy to make with ingredients around the kitchen. I doubled the quantities and added a dash of Louisiana Hot Sauce to kick it up. Everyone in the party enjoyed it and wanted some more. Next time I will triple the quantities.
297761,26420,2014-03-28,5,"This was excellent -- I usually hate all other forms of purchased cocktail sauce because they&#039;re too sweet or just blah. However, sometimes I just purchase Silver Springs cocktail sauce (found in the cold-case deli section of the store) and add a little extra horseradish to it and it&#039;s very good."
2000886170,26420,2016-02-22,5,Easy &amp; delicious.  Better than anything you can by at the store.  Love it!
2000997235,26420,2016-05-02,5,Easy and delish!
2001417173,26420,2017-03-04,5,Super easy. Didn't have horseradish though. Instead of going to the store to get it I used Wasabi paste I had in the fridge. I used 1T but it was too much. Doing it again I would add 1tsp and go up from there. I also added dehydrated onions to the mix. About 4tsp. Tastes great after letting the flavors meld.
2001511195,26420,2017-04-28,0,This is perfect. I &quot;up' the horseradish. So-o-o tasty.
2001607116,26420,2017-07-01,0,Wonderful recipe! I made it on the spur of the moment and it was perfect!
1185804,26420,2018-04-25,5,Made a half recipe and it worked great!
2001610036,26420,2018-06-10,5,Followed the directions exactly and this turned out delicious!! I used it to dip my tempura shrimp. Won't be buying store bought cocktail sauce again. My new go to recipe:)
2002314081,26420,2018-10-27,5,No need to ever buy cocktail sauce again.
58762,9518,2002-11-09,1,ummm...is this even a recipe?

171724,9518,2004-11-10,5,"I make this often.I toast the bread first and then it is just like a grilled cheese sandwich. Lower
in calories cause you aren't using any butter"
1535,9518,2004-11-10,5,"DH makes these all the time when he wants a before-bed snack. He usually makes them open-face though. I prefer a traditional grilled cheese sandwich but I give this 5 stars because, to me, they mean I don't have to get up and fix him anything!!! :oD"
181879,9518,2004-12-22,0,"i made this for my sister when she was little, and she loved it.  I eat them too now when i'm lazy and hungry"
125266,9518,2004-12-29,1,I raised my godson on real grilled cheese sandwiches-rye with extra sharp cooked in seasoned iron skillet. His mother followed your recipe. Now he is enrolled at the Culinary Institute of the Arts. Is this just adolescent rebellion? I attribute it all to various methods of the grilled cheese dilemma. 
213547,9518,2005-07-14,5,"If you can't figure out a sandwich like this, you shouldn't be looking at recipes in general.  No offense, but these seem to take up more space than it is worth. "
115853,9518,2005-08-17,5,"I've made this for years! I've gotta give it 5 stars for simplicity and nostalgia. :-) My friend and I made this as a quick snack before we were allowed to use the stove. (Don't even ask how long ago that was.) We dubbed it the ""Microwave Cheese Sandwich."" One thing we learned is, do NOT cook over 30 seconds or the bread will get hard/chewy as it cools. Also, I've noticed certain brands of bread are better for this. Merita is excellent, if you can get it. Sunbeam gets gooey for some reason."
140028,9518,2006-02-28,5,LOL I used to do this a lot! Thanks for the reminder!
179133,9518,2006-02-28,5,"I do this all the time when I want a quick ""grilled"" cheese sandwich - and no butter needed so lower fat & calories than the real thing. Even better if you have a toaster oven to melt the cheese because the toast stays crispier. Thanks for sharing Harry! :)"
130663,9518,2006-02-28,5,This was fast and lower in calories. Very good.
250309,9518,2006-02-28,2,microwaving makes the bread gross and it doesn't really make it any quicker than using a skillet.
172169,9518,2006-03-01,3,"My apologies, Happy Harry, but the m'wave makes the bread real soggy and chewy, as if it had been dipped in fondue. Sorry for the 3 stars."
242929,9518,2006-03-02,0,"We used to do this for kids at the daycare I worked at. It didn't taste as good as the original, but it is lower in fat and the kids loved them!"
122235,9518,2006-03-05,1,"I tried this (with toasted bread) when I got my first microwave years ago.  The cookbook that came with it included this recipe.  I thought: how bad could it be?  Unfortunately, the  answer is: really bad.  It is SO worth the minimal effort involved to grill the sandwich, even if that does add some grams of fat, at least the results are edible."
289860,9518,2006-03-06,2,"Make it a 90 Second Sandwich by toasting the bread first - and you've got a winner.  PLUS, use more than one miserly slice of cheese!

I've made ""grilled"" cheese sandwiches this way for years and like the lack of added fat.

"
193516,9518,2006-03-07,5,"I used to have this daily when I was young. I still enjoy this, with light old cheddar cheese on occasion today.  It's a great way to change up a plain cold cheese sandwich.  Best of all it is extremely quick and tasty! :)"
208136,9518,2006-03-11,5,This was college staple food for me! I made them even less like a grilled cheese. I used to put it in an open baggie first before putting it in the microwave so that the bread would get really soft and the cheese would melt better. I then microwaved it for only about 20 seconds. The bag and the shorter time seemed to help keep the bread from getting hard. Ham added to the sandwich is nice as well.
322326,9518,2006-10-01,5,"this is just how my gran gives us our cheese sandwichs, though she adds a slice of ham and a bit of chutney, very good."
37036,9518,2007-05-04,5,I've been eating cheese sandwiches for years.  I normally add a thin layer of mayo.  Great on the go sandwich!
43083,9518,2007-11-12,4,I have made this sandwich many a times..especially when I was younger and my cooking skills were not the same as they are now:) I used to do it when I didnt feel like making a grilled cheese..
286665,9518,2008-08-12,1,"I donâ€™t mean to be disrespectful, butâ€¦this isnâ€™t a recipe.  This is however, one of the laziest excuses for a grilled cheese sandwich Iâ€™ve ever seen.  I will conclude by saying this, if â€œafter a night on the tilesâ€� as you put it, this is the best you could do, then you might consider rehab! Ha-ha!"
206385,9518,2008-08-13,5,"I make this exact sandwich, with one exception, to go with a large glass of ice cold milk.  The only thing I do different is I do not microwave.  It's just perfect before or during a busy day!"
359220,9518,2008-08-13,5,"This ""non recipe"" got me through all of my teenage summer days; only I ate it for breakfast while watching TV (oh- those lazy days!).  So yummy and works well on any type of bread- sliced sandwich, bagel and english muffins for instance.  Mmmm!"
533612,9518,2008-09-19,1,"An extra few seconds could make this better in several ways. Calling this a recipe is quite a stretch. Search for ""grilled cheese"" and do yourself a favor, the extra time, and pat of butter, are well worth it."

83093,205712,2008-03-23,5,"First off, forget that drizzle, dip, dressing and sauce business and just go ahead and drink it. ;-) It's that good!  I dunked a strawberry in some; great of course.  I dolloped it on a piece of warm, recipe #209214.  Heaven! But the best bite of all was straight out of a spoon! The taste is hard to describe; close to that of a cheesecake but the texture is more like a mousse.  Unfortunately, I only made half a recipe so I have it hidden for tomorrow when DH is at work and I can eat it all.   The cornstarch and juices took about 10 minutes to thicken up. The texture really changes with the egg addition. It gets thick and bubbly looking. After cooking the egg mixture a couple of minutes, I added the chunks of cream cheese (lowfat) and stirred it into the hot mixture. This gets pretty thick when cooled so to make this a 5 in 1 recipe, add to your list that I think it would make a terrific pie filling.  I can hardly wait to experiment more with this nectar. ;-) Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
315565,205712,2009-10-31,5,This is delicious. I served with recipe #392200. I used very thick WW sour cream instead of cream cheese and with whisking it all came together beautifully. Made and enjoyed for Zaar Cookbook tag
424680,205712,2011-04-24,5,"Outstanding! I used this only as a dip this first time around, but after [1]recently making a chocolate pie & [2]reading SusieQusie's review from several years ago, I've decided that my next go at this recipe will be to make it thicker & use it as a second & top layer for a chocolate pie! I think that would be awesome! Many thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Cookbook Tag]"
16758,8559,2001-09-04,1,it is not that good its watery would not make again she must have forgot some thing in the ingredients
27381,8559,2002-06-02,1,"Sorry, I agree. This is way to soupy to be called chop suey. I drained off the liquid and then had to spice it up a bit with more soy sauce and pepper. I served with rice instead of bread."

356127,8559,2010-04-28,5,this recipe is basicallly great-only thing i did differently was to thicken the broth-i added 1-tlb-cornstarch -to boullion before adding to rest- and found the recipe great ?i served this on rice -thanks dear for your entry=

58104,96727,2004-08-10,5,"
There is NO way this can last 2 months in the fridge! Two of us ate it in 2 days! But wait I did cut the recipe down to fourth of what it calls for. As you see in the picture I made it on bread in the oven. The oil came through the bread making the bottom soft, rich and yummy and the top was gooey, crisp, garlicky, and salty. Being it called for so much garlic I used the crushed jar garlic. I hardly ever use it. It `s in my fridge for emergency `s. This would be great on a home made pizza, in Quesadillas, top a meatloaf with it, Or blend it into your favorite baked pasta. This is a must make. Yes I was foolish not to make the whole recipe. A keeper!"
128447,96727,2004-09-13,2,"If you want to keep everyone you meet 20 feet away from you, just eat a piece of this bread.  I like garlic, but OH MY GOD not this much.  Sorry, I would never make this again"
176615,96727,2005-01-02,5,"Very good, cheesy bread. I cut the recipe down to 1 pint and used it on a loaf of Failproof French Bread #81211, sliced, then broiled until melted. Like Rita L, I used bottled minced garlic which was very convenient though I may actually increase the amount next time. I really liked that this is made with olive oil that has a lot more health benefits than butter, and the oil sinks into the bread for a wonderful flavor. Everyone loved this, even the kids. My fridge is jammed, I may make some more to store in the freezer. Thanks, C in PA for a super recipe!"
191436,96727,2005-02-04,4,"Very good spread recipe! I think next time I will leave out the lemon juice. I did not care for the lemon taste so much but the garlic was heavenly! I am making this for company tomorrow night.
Thanks!"
104600,96727,2005-05-02,5,"This was definately GARLIC bread...  but everyone wanted 2 jars.  Now I'm getting calls to make more...  If you LOVE garlic, ya gotta try this one.  Thanks for a great recipe.  By the way, it's even better after being in the refrigerator a couple of days."
131126,96727,2005-05-12,5,"I reduced the amounts to make 1/4 of the recipe.  We were very pleased with this cheesy, very garlicy spread.  It melted well on french loaves.  I did add dried parsley flakes to the spread for some color. Thanks for sharing your recipe.  "
36944,96727,2005-06-14,5,"This is so easy to make and tastes delicious!  It stays great in the fridge and I think it gets more flavorful the longer it sits!  But don't expect it to last very long.  It doesn't have to be just a bread spread..try it on veggies, omelets, tortillas, soften it a bit in the microwave for a quick appy to spread on crackers. Thanks for sharing your recipe C in PA!"
113117,96727,2005-06-23,5,This was delicious and so convenient. I tried on Ritz crackers while I was waiting to bake the bread and it was awesome.  Thanks for such a great recipe.
187276,96727,2006-06-13,5,I belong to the canning group where this was posted and have been making it for several years.  Have people begging me to make all the time.  Wonderful!!!!!
213114,96727,2006-09-26,5,Yum! I used fresh minced garlic when I mixed up a jar of this. I made some french bread and topped it with the spread. OMG! It was wonderful served with Sausage Gumbo. It could always be made with less garlic for someone who wants a milder garlic taste. mmmmmmmm
276718,96727,2006-11-15,5,"Made this yesterday and haven't even been able to make garlic bread out of it yet!!!  First tried it on crackers; yummy, garlicy, addicting.  Then I used someone elses suggestion and mixed it into my meatloaf mixture.  The whole house smelled wonderful - my DH even said he could smell it at the end of our street!  He thought that was the best meatloaf he ever tasted, even better than his mothers - now thats saying alot!  I quartered the recipe since there is only the two of us.  Thank you for posting!  Can't wait to try it today as garlic toast and leftover meatloaf. 10/20/06 Finally made the garlic bread and it was wonderful.  Baked it then broiled it so the cheese was a little toasted.  Great garlic recipe.11/15/06 Last night I put this on top of some canned spinach and broiled it, awsome!"
614976,96727,2008-03-02,5,"Made this yesterday for a birthday party and served it with spaghetti. It was one of the first things to go at the table. It was very easy to prepare and tasted great. I made one before hand in my toaster oven to see if it needed anything extra, but it was just right. I think the mixture of the 3 cheeses gives it the perfect flavor -- i love how i didn't need to add any salt. I added extra garlic and i left out the lemon juice. Great recipe, thanks!"
131021,96727,2009-06-20,4,I made about a 1/5 recipe but I let the computer do the calculations and they were a bit funky-1/5 of 1 cup is not 1/4 cup or garlic-. I didn't realize this until later so I will probably try it again. We did like it a lot it was just too strong. I love that if you don't use it all you can store it for a while.
114681,96727,2009-12-05,5,Real nice.  Cut the recipe to 1 pint.  Looked like a lot but really wasn't on a loaf of French Bread.  Two of us inhaled it.  The EVO made a different taste from the usual butter.  Like the bread dipping oil.  The lemon juice also contributed.  A keeper and maker again.  Thanks for sharing.
526666,96727,2009-12-09,5,"OK, I know how to keep the vampires away! LOL This stuff is great! I reduced the recipe, but I could see making the full recipe up, serving for a dinner with friends and handing them a jar of this on the way out the door! I enjoyed the flavors, and think that the lemon added a bit of brightness. Thanks so much for sharing, C in PA."
192264,96727,2009-12-19,5,Yummmm! Great flavor & easy. I don't think this will last long at my house! Thanks for a good & easy recipe.
140132,96727,2010-01-29,5,"What a great bread spread!!!  I made this, only to realize I only had half the amount of mozzerella called for so added monterey jack cheese also.  Great recipe!!!  I loved this as did my family.  I will make this bread many times.....thank you so much for sharing this with us."
305531,96727,2010-04-09,5,"Yum! This is so easy and so tasty! I only made 1/4 of the recipe for 2 of us, but now I think that I'll make it again and always have on reserve. Thanks C in PA. Made for Cookbook Tag."
1102893,96727,2011-03-20,5,"Definitely very yummy. I used a coarsely shredded mozz, I think it would be more spreadable with finer shreds. That won't stop me from using up this original batch, and going on for more!"
851405,96727,2011-04-08,5,"I can't believe I forgot to review this.  This is really awesome.  My kids love it.  I make it every time we have spaghetti or lasagna. I've even made one night while watching a movie.  It reminds me of the Rockefeller bread that the Fish House Vera Cruz in San Marcos, CA serves minus the spinach."
179133,96727,2011-12-07,5,Wow is this garlicy (not that that's a bad thing!) I quartered the recipe and had enough for 2 mini baguettes. I had to use shredded romano not grated so added a little extra. I also used half fresh garlic and half pickled garlic (it was from recipe #263732 - I didn't want to waste it and wasn't sure what else to do with it!) Went great with the black bean soup I had for dinner. Thanks for sharing!
178427,96727,2011-12-27,5,Wow!! This was awesome. I made one pint as there is only 2 of us. I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. It was perfect. Next time I plan to make more so I can share with friends. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.
88099,96727,2012-01-20,5,"Very very good.  Great combination of cheese flavors, but I will cut back just a little on the Romano cheese next time as I personally thought it was a little stronge.  I made only a third of the recipe and have plenty for lots of bread.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Best of 2011 tag game."
407338,245950,2007-08-13,4,"Good on top of rice, but I found it lacking a little something.  Therefore, I added a teaspoon each of vinegar and sugar which helped.  I only used half the amount of bacon grease.  Thanks for sharing."
143933,292147,2008-04-18,0,This is now my best bread.  I did divide the the amount into 2 loaves get a smaller slice.  I calculated about 50 calories for about 40 small slices.  I like the smaller loaf size.
1176241,292147,2009-04-01,5,"perfect!  i *had* a standard everyday 100% ww recipe i used, but this is my new standard!  thanks so much."
1535,292147,2010-02-25,5,"Wow! I'm impressed! This was as soft and light as store bought wheat bread and lot more flavorful. Even my son, who usually doesn't care for 100% whole wheat bread, asked for seconds. I served it with Recipe #276895. This bread will be made again, often! Thanks for sharing it."
185684,292147,2010-03-31,5,"Very nice bread, soft, chewy, fluffy, fantastic. I did not have gluten so I left it out and still made very good bread, thank you."
1665656,292147,2010-08-15,0,"Amazing!  For the first time, a loaf of 100% whole wheat bread that doesn't come out like a brick!  Quite the opposite actually!  My wife is having a piece and going crazy about it right now.  More recipes like this please!"
314211,292147,2011-02-01,5,At last!  I feel like singing!  I too have been looking for a simple dependable 100%ww at is usable for sandwiches and toast!  I made exactly as printed except there the smallest loaf size on my machine is 2.0 - it still worked well an is my new standard!
350812,292147,2011-05-14,5,I was looking for a low sugar whole wheat bread and this was GREAT!  This is an excellent sandwich bread as it has a very mild taste...it will go great with PB&J or deli meats.  I used skim milk with 1t vinegar and  made the dough in my bread machine and then baked in 2 stoneware loaf pans @ 375 for about 25-30 minutes until the tops were a deep tan color.
437991,423880,2010-05-25,5,Mango Lassi just could not fail! Made for ZWT6
527886,423880,2010-05-28,0,"It's definitely fast! I prefer the texture from using an actual mango, but this is a nice drink when convenience is more important."
552613,423880,2010-06-03,4,It doesn't get much easier than this recipe! If you don't have the actual mango fruit around this is an easy fix to satisfy your sweet tooth while still being a healthy drink.  I used nearly fat free natural yoghurt and it worked just fine.  Made for vegetarian swap.
35965,31683,2002-09-12,5,"I didn't use leftovers as I usually don't have any.  I cooked up 1 cup of frozen corn, 1 cup of brussel sprouts and 1 cup of lima beans, then used them for the three cups of vegetables.  I figured leftover veggies would have been cooked...lol.  One bite and my husband said, ""This is definitely 5 stars!""  I had a big dinner in the works (was serving in courses), but he ate two huge plates and was too full to eat much else.  I will definitely be making this a lot.  In the past I've thrown those 1 cup leftovers in the garbage, but now I think I'll dedicate a bowl for accumulating 3 cups of veggies in the freezer for this casserole.  I can see it wouldn't hardly matter what vegetable you used, it would still be good!  Thank you for sharing this recipe Tara.  It is delicious!!!"
30789,31683,2002-09-16,5,"Is this ever good!  The vegetables I used were leftover fresh ones:  corn, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli. I used cheddar and jack cheeses. Everyone in my family loved it and I will certainly be making this casserole often.  Thanks, Tara!"
22724,31683,2002-09-30,5,"What a delicious way to use up left over veggies...or as in my case...I had a bag of mixed veggies that was not quite enough to use for a full meal, and a bag of broccoli florets that wasn't enough for a full meal either.  I just cooked them up, then continued with your recipe as directed.  I was skeptical that I could get them to try it...but they did and it was a huge hit!!  This is definitely going in the veggie rotation list!  Thanks for the GREAT recipe :)"
45001,31683,2002-12-06,5,"Fantastic way to use leftovers.  The milk and eggs make a nice custard.  I use a lot more than just 3 cups veggies, perhaps even 4-5.  This can be a good meatless entree, accompanied with bread and salad."
116478,31683,2004-01-09,5,"Yummy! This recipe was nice and easy (an amateur cook here). Didn't have leftovers so I cooked up carrots, broccoli and potatos. Used Mozzarella & Racclette cheese b/c that's all I had.  It turned out great. Thanks!"
54243,31683,2004-05-21,5,"I enjoyed this casserole. I used carrots, broccoli, and celery.   It was a light, sweet tasting casserole that looked good and tasted even better.  My husband said ""Breakfast tomorrow""...and that is sooo unlike him..Really a nice casserole to use up leftovers."
104283,31683,2004-06-02,5,"My family thought this was a yummy side dish casserole. I used our favorite vegetables: corn, broccoli, and carrots. I used grated colby cheese. This had a good custard-like texture and will make a good side for most anything. Thanks--will be making this often."
89435,31683,2005-02-06,5,"this is one of the easiest , tastiest recipes that i have made. we had a bunch of random things in the fridge... nothing really that fit together to make a meal and then i found this recipe. it turned out alot better than i had hoped. it is similar to a breakfast casserole but so much better!  i used (silk brand) soy milk instead of regular milk. i used a can of mixed vegetables (which had : carrots, potatoes, celery, peas, green beans, corn, and lima beans.) i also had some chopped brocoli that i added. i really liked the variety that the mixed vegetables added as well as it being easy ( just opening the can and pouring it in). i think it would be really good to add some tomato next time. will definately use this recipe again.
thanks tara!"
36944,31683,2006-01-18,5,"This recipe was so fast to put together and will make a very simple and delicious side dish or entree.  It gets an extra star from me for being able to use leftovers or whatever you have on hand.  I used corn, green peas,tomatoes and whole wheat bread.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Tara."
185708,31683,2006-01-21,4,"This was great for using up those bits and pieces in the fridge. I used a mix of leftover and frozen veggies (corn, peppers, spinach, peas) and diced ham to equal 3 cups. I buttered the casserole dish, but otherwise skipped the butter and didn't miss it at all. Also, I added a dash of hot sauce and 1 t. dijon mustard to milk mixture. Took almost an hour to bake, so I may try it at 350 next time. "
210117,31683,2006-02-04,5,"I love this recipe! As mentioned before it is a great way to use leftover veggies.  I doubled the recipe to use as a side dish for a large family dinner, then the next morning I heated the leftovers for breakfast for my husband and I. Thanks!"
147109,31683,2006-08-18,3,"This recipe is very easy, but just not to our taste I guess.  I thought the custard like texture was just not something we would probably like again. I might try it one more time with different veggies (I used corn, peas and green beans) or different bread (I used homemade bread). Thanks!"
141012,31683,2006-10-16,5,"This is easiest vegetable casserole ever, except for a bit of chopping that takes time. It always turns out perfect and looks fabulous. I have doubled and tripled the recipe on various occasions. It has never failed me, except once when I used zuchinni and it gave off a lot of liquid. There was a puddle at the bottom on the dish. I now saute vegetables like mushrooms and zuchinni that give off a lot of liquid if I have to use them. It is amazing the day it is made, but tends to lose some of its texture the next day. Highly recommend for a dinner party, Thanks for sharing"
458087,31683,2007-04-26,5,Tried it with mushrooms peas corn and peppers! Turned out really good!!
403089,31683,2007-08-13,4,"This recipes is really great!  I used some frozen veggies (corn, peas and spinach) wheat bread and mozz and it was mighty tasty.  I used it a side-dish along with some Aidells sausage, it was a fantastic meal and so simple only taking minutes to assemble.  I will definitely be making this again, it's a quick, tasty, versatile (ie; you can really make it with whatever you want!) meal. Thanks Tara!"
144897,31683,2007-10-09,4,This was easy to put together and tasty also.  I'll have to remember to try it with a different veggie combo sometime too :)
288351,31683,2008-02-06,5,"I made this with brussel sprouts, corn and mixed veggies.  It was a hit with my kiddos and DH.  I did have some watery issues at the bottom of the pan, but no one seemed that bothered by it and we hardly had any leftovers!  Great idea for leftover veggies!  I'll make this again and again. *The biggest hit so far has been broccoli, corn and carrots. Thanks!"
442988,31683,2008-03-06,5,"Loved it!  My husband declared that this was perfect comfort food.  The quality of the dish depends on what you put in it, doesn't it?  I used a ton of veggies -- 7 different kinds, and probably closer to five cups than three.  To keep it WW-friendly, I used Trader Joe's low-calorie wheat bread, skipped the margarine, used skim milk, and reduced-fat smoked Gouda and reduced-fat sharp cheddar.  And I topped it with a quarter cup of fresh grated Parmesan.  It was delicious!  Thanks so much for posting this."
167179,31683,2008-03-13,4,"I made this last night for the first time.  I used cauliflower, brocoli, and green beans and I used a blend of swiss and sharp cheddar cheese.  It is a mild dish; the texture and flavor reminded me a lot of the flavor and texture of quiche. Next time, I am going to try adding some onions and spinach and more cheese on the top.  Still a pretty good recipe.  Thank you for submitting it!"
323328,31683,2008-03-20,4,"We had this this evening and its pretty darn good!  I used a dense white bread, parmesan cheese in the mixture (probably closer to a cup), and sharp cheddar on the top to cover.  I also used skim milk and it was fine with that.
I keep a container in my freezer where I dump all the little bits or leftover veggies that I usually use in vegetable soup, so I just defrosted that and it was about 4 cups, so I just dumped it all in.  I think next time I'll be sure there are some onions in there, but overall it was very good.    I think spinach would be great as well as cauliflower.   The corn was also tasty in there!!
Thanks for sharing a great recipe for using up my veggie leftovers.  DH says its a keeper!"
61010,31683,2008-08-24,4,"This is a very good casserole on the order of a quiche with no crust.  It's versatile in that it adapts to any vegies, and I used leftover corn and peas, broad beans and zucchini.  I served it with tomato soup and it was a quick and tasty dinner."
281330,31683,2008-11-03,4,"Very good.  I used broccoli, red pepper, onions and snow peas.  Also, for cheese I used brie in the filling and chÃ¨vre noir on top.  It was a nice combination.
Thank you."
307059,31683,2009-01-03,4,"My family enjoyed this casserole.  Although my husband said it could use a little more flavor.  Next time I will use 1/2 evaporated milk as you suggested. I used brocolli, cauliflower and carrots for the vegetables.  Thanks for sharing."
317631,31683,2009-08-03,5,"My impression when looking over the ingredients was there wasn't much (besides salt) to accent the taste of the vegetables. So I added a chicken bullion cube to the milk, and also stirred in a blend of Italian seasonings, which included sage. My first thought when taking my first bite? Omigod - this is vegetable STUFFING! Really, just like stuffing at Thanksgiving, except instead of just bread and herbs and whatever other things some people put in, it's chock-a-block with vegetables. I think I would have found it a bit on the bland side if I hadn't included the extras that I did. As it was, it was really tasty comfort food. With all the cheese in there, I think you could also decrease (perhaps even omit?) the margarine. Shall try that next time and see how it turns out. In any case, I will probably even up the sage a bit - love that unexpected little savoury taste of Thanksgiving."
215898,31683,2009-10-07,4,Very good and easy to make!
1376400,31683,2009-10-24,5,"I altered the recipe quite a bit in term of flavoring but used the same amount of the backbone ingredients (milk, eggs, bread, cooked veggie). I made 2/3 of the recipe, used butter instead of margarine, added a cube of chicken bouillon, sprinkled the mixture with italian seasoning (as one of the other reviewers had suggested), used 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp pepper for this 2/3 of the recipe. For cheese, i used half asiago and half medium cheddar."
1072593,31683,2009-11-15,5,A recipe boost for plain vegetables and likening it to the difference of shopping at K-Mart as compared to Neiman Marcus. Made for Alphabet Soup Tag.
252084,31683,2010-05-01,4,"Delicious, and even better texture when reheated the next day!!  I think 4-qt is a typo; mine fit in a 2-qt even with a little extra bread.  Picture seems to show a 2-qt. casserole dish.   And friends, please, use butter.  Margerine is NOT better for you and doesn't taste as good!  ;-)"
1800198467,31683,2013-11-05,1,"Mine wasn&#039;t creamy, it was more lumpy and mushy. Did I do something wrong?"
573325,286484,2011-11-16,4,"This is very easy and quick to prepare and makes for a delish breakkie. I loved how healthy this is and how nice the spices complemented the banana flavour. I think next time I might add a dash of cinnamon as well. <br/>THANKS SO MUCH for sharing this keeper with us, Cookgirl and THANKS to Tasty, too. ;)<br/>Made and reviewed for Veggie Swap #40 November 2011."
55122,67142,2003-11-13,1,"Tried this and had to throw it out.  I had the recipe for this cobbler somewhere, but misplaced it so I tried this one.  I do believe my original recipe calls for self-rising flour, not all-purpose.  Also, before it finished baking, I had to drain some of the liquid off.  I would drain the liquid from one of the cans of fruit and use half as much butter."
156034,145831,2006-05-09,5,"Thanks to Paul's recipe, I now weigh 9125 lbs.!  Just kidding...you could really do yourself in eating these though.  The texture is great and the flavors blend together extremely well.

THANKS FOR ADDING A NEW STAPLE TO MY RECIPE STASH!!!"
297543,145831,2006-06-03,5,Loved it!! Very rich and creamy and best of all it has my favorite..crispy bacon. These are fantastic kicked up mashed potatoes.
247940,163238,2006-04-07,5,"Oh, I love this recipe! My MIL taught me how to make it like this many years ago and it's scrumptious! *hint* This also works just as well with bulk sausage instead of dried beef."
9717,163238,2006-10-09,5,"I chose this recipe for PAC and my whole family loved it.  Thanks for posting a great ""comfort food"" recipe.  I will try it, as another reviewer suggested, next time with sausage.  Thanks again."
210188,163238,2007-01-16,5,"This is how I make mine. My father picked up this recipe, supposedly, while he was in the army (WWII). He taught my mother how to make it and I learned by watching. However, I use differentamounts and I make hardboiled eggs and slice them onto the toast before putting the chipped beef over it. Thanks for the suggestion of putting it over home fries.  I never thought of that!
Lee"
343262,163238,2008-01-17,5,"Great recipe ! One can also use part evaporated milk , it's creamy and isn't as expensive as cream. This is great made with ground beef that has been browned and drained. Add lots of black pepper and serve on toast or mashed potatoes. Either meat you use will make a warm filling meal. I've seen recipes that call for 1 cup shredded cheese to be melted into the white sauce."
56003,163238,2008-05-20,4,"This was really good, and brought back childhood memories.  My mother used to make this frequently as we were growing up.  Thnx for posting, Sherie17.  We will have this again."
369715,163238,2008-06-21,5,This was just as I remember. My mom use to make this all the time. We love chipped beef on toast but I have been buying the stouffers kind. Hubby said he was hungry for it and I had some chipped beef in the fridge and thought it couldn't be that hard to make. So I looked for a recipe and found this one. This was very easy to make and was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly but added more milk at the end as it was a bit too thick for us. Will be using this recipe again- no more store bought for us!
1136209,163238,2010-02-15,5,This is how we make it also. The dried beef was always expensive so my mother would use good lebanon bologna and now that is what my kids prefer
952152,163238,2010-03-10,5,"Yes, this is true Pennsylvania Dutch Dried Beef!  Most people don't bother to brown the meat, or ""frizzle"" it as my dutch relatives say.  This really adds to the flavor.  Great recipe."
990914,163238,2012-05-25,5,While visiting my daughter in S. Pa. and saw delicious dried beef at a local market and purchased it to make some creamed chipped beef. My Dad was a cook in Korea and made this for us as children and I loved it. In my area all you can find is that awful jarred so called dried beef meat. I made your recipe and it was delicious. Thanks for bringing a fond childhood memory back to life.
1846441,163238,2012-12-02,5,"This is a great recipe.....a flavor I've tried many times to replicate and your technique did it.  I made a couple of changes.  For health reasons, I cut the butter and flour in half.   I sliced a bunch of green onions and sauteed them in the butter before adding the dried beef.  Then I split  the liquid equally between milk and creme fraiche. The creme fraiche has some nice qualities in this situation.  It is very tolerant to cooking temperatures and rich and creamy.  I also added a few tablespoons of white wine and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  It is magnificent.  I would say without hesitation that it is the basic recipe that makes this so successful.  Thank you."
2664120,163238,2013-02-07,5,"If you want the absolute best chipped beef for this purpose, I most highly recommend ordering it from S. Clyde Weaver online (a family-owned Lancaster county company, from which this recipe derives); their's is incomparable--being from Lancaster, I've tried from many purveyors."

371672,309594,2009-01-13,5,"Excellent weeknight get-it-on-the-table-quick, oh-my-gosh-that's-good dinner (and complete in much less than the stated time - you should adjust that so you can list this as a one-dish, under 30 minute recipe).

I stirred in the thyme/oregano/garlic-powder in for a few seconds before the wet ingredients - a quick burst of dry heat brings out the flavor in dry spices.

Thanks for a great easy recipe, AllergyGirl (and

33722,95926,2004-07-22,5,"I have made this since I was a kid and it is one of my favorite sandwiches.  I have heard about it with Peanut Butter, but nothing beats the mayo.  Don't knock it til you try it."
146637,95926,2004-11-02,5,My mom used to make these for me. I love them with salt and pepper. Very good.
202733,95926,2005-03-14,5,"Daddy used to make these for us when we were little, they were a BIG treat in our household.  Unfortunately, I have extremely low blood pressure and can no longer eat bananas, but oh I remember these sandwiches and how daddy would put lots of pepper on the mayo, simply delicious!!! And they don't give you that heavy feeling like peanut butter and banana sandwiches do  :)"
21841,95926,2005-04-08,5,Yum is right!  Been eating these for years.  Very fresh bread is a must.  Thanks for posting.....think I will have one for lunch today!
40560,95926,2005-04-09,5,"When I saw this recipe I couldn't believe it.  I had forgotten all about it.  it was my fav..as a a sub teen/teen/grandma.
GOOD GOING."
17803,95926,2005-04-10,5,"Being a mayo lover myself, this was just A-okay in my book!  I used one piece of white and one of wheat. Next time I make this I'll cut the mayo back to 1 1/2  teaspoon per slice of bread as my banana slices would slide around as I tried to eat the sandwich.  LOL "
125808,95926,2005-04-10,5,I grew up on these.  :-)
170959,95926,2005-04-24,0,I LOVE banana sandwiches made this way!! Never ate them any other way growing up. So glad to see that many others are now joining us in our mayo/banana lovefest!
29782,95926,2005-06-23,5,"Just came across this recipe. I also have made banana sandwiches for years. Its very easy and simple to make and taste is delicious. Some folks likes peanut butter in place of mayonnaise, I personally am a mayonnaise person. LOL  Thanks for sharing this oldie but goodie recipe! I have a banana so I think I'm off to make one right now. YUM!"
54271,95926,2005-08-07,5,I thought everyone ate these! SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! The freshest bread possible is a must. DH likes mayo on one side and peanut butter on the other. You have to try this!! 
233014,95926,2005-10-02,5,I've been eating this since my dad introduced it to me 20 years ago. The only difference is he puts some salt in his hand and rubs them together over the sandwich. The little bit of salt adds a great flavor.
169969,95926,2006-02-02,5,After seeing Marsha D's photos and smelling the Buttermilk Honey Wheat Bread I had baking in the oven (recipe #128588) I knew I had a winning match. This was the best banana sandwich I have made!
302815,95926,2006-03-18,1,"A sandwich can taste great to one person and terrible to another. The banana with mayo just does not go, it has acidity and banana is sweet. I made it,i ate it ( at least tried), I throw it. I made it again as a sweet sandwich useing thick whip cream in place of the mayo. Try both yourself! I tested both  at a party, nearly all the mayo were left, the banana cream filling were all gone. Action speaks better than words.

95372,95926,2006-06-13,5,The best ever!!!!  I moved to NM frome NC and nobody here even heard of mayo and 'naner sandwich!!! (or slaw on hot dogs!!!)
428463,95926,2007-01-12,5,This is my all time #1 favorite sandwich! If I go too long without it I crave it. I remember my grandpa making these for me and my sister when we were young. I have them at work for lunch all the time and people this I'm crazy but they just need to try it themselves!
106777,95926,2007-06-23,5,Love love love this sandwich - grew up on it!!  Peanut butter is good.. but mayo?? UNBELIEVABLE!!
47510,95926,2008-01-04,5,"I grew up eating these, haven't had one in ages, but this recipe sure did bring back some good memories.  My grandmother used to make these for me and they were delicious!"
292308,95926,2008-03-03,5,"When I was growing up, my dad ate one of these every Sunday morning for breakfast before church (with a glass of Tang :)  We also like them for a light dinner.  The tang of mayo (I prefer Dukes) goes well with sweet banana (make sure they are ripe!)  I actually had one for dinner the other night (b/f stumbling across this).  Do try it.  I've also seen people mayo one slice of bread, lay banana in it like a hotdog, and eat it like that :)"
4740,95926,2008-06-05,2,I don't know about this one.  I tried it and one of my daughters tried it and thought it was just ok.  It was good but I think I'd rather eat a banana by itself.
206442,95926,2009-08-29,5,"Oh my, I grew up eating banana sandwiches and I still eat them.  White bread & Dukes Mayonnaise.  Wash it down with a cold glass of milk.  Simple and delish!"
1612977,95926,2010-05-10,4,"I grew up eating these. Nothin' gourmet but sometimes this is the only thing that'll hit the spot. Fresh, white bread and Duke's mayo are essential."
122878,95926,2010-06-15,5,"I too grew up eating these and still do.  You've got to love the simplicity.  They are so, so good but darned if I can get my kids or grandkids to try them.  Oh well, more for me."
139381,95926,2010-06-16,5,"I too grew up eating these.  We did do them with just a light sprinkling of sugar.  Ahhh!  Nostagia!  I haven't eaten one in years, but I have bananas on hand and tomorrow just might be the right day!  Thanks for a lovely reminder!"
605574,95926,2010-07-31,0,"My family has eaten these all our lives, though a lot of people thought we were strange.  It makes a fabulous breakfast, snack or lunch.  They're great with wheat bread too!"
286566,95926,2010-08-31,5,"I made this for the DM and she loved the twist of having the mayo on the sandwich, I would have used about 2 teaspoons and 1 large banana and 2 slices of wholemeal/wholegrain bread. Thoroughly enjoyed, thank you MizEmerill, made for Potluck Tag."
844554,95926,2010-09-16,5,"Talk about bringing back childhood memories!!! When I found this recipe, I just had to make one of these again. I had forgotten how tasty they were. I thought we were the only ones to eat this but I can see I was mistaken. Thanks for memory lane."
475484,95926,2011-02-17,1,"Im sorry but you must have to grow up eating this to like it, It was like savoury and sweet that wernt meant to be"
526666,95926,2011-05-06,5,"This is such a treasured childhood memory...I love banana sandwiches and still indulge, occasionally! The bread must be fresh, and 'my' mayo must be Kraft! I sure appreciate your sharing this recipe, MizEmerilLagasse!"
2208765,95926,2012-03-11,5,"My dad use to make me these as a kid.  One of my favorites.  People think I'm crazy because I love these sandwiches, but they just don't know how good they are!  I also like to put chips on this sandwich too.  I like the crunch against the texture of the soft bread and bananas."
2210747,95926,2012-03-14,5,I love banana and mayo sandwiches! I grew up on them. Don't know where everyone is from but it must be a southern thang! Adding a sprinkle of sugar is also very good. I do know some people that like them with marshmallow fluff instead of mayo.
2401954,95926,2012-09-14,5,"This is a sandwich that requires no recipe: start with 2 slices of fresh, soft bread (white or wheat); slather on as much mayonnaise as you like on both slices of bread (I like the sandwich to be rather moist so I use a lot); put as many banana slices as you can across one slice of bread (I prefer to cut mine in lengthwise halves); and then cap the sandwich off with the second slice of bread (pressing slightly to create a nice seal).  Like others have said, this is a sandwich that reminds me of my childhood - I'd eat 2 of them most afternoons when I arrived home from school.  And most definitely, this sandwich is a Southern specialty.  Edited to add star rating."
2879123,95926,2013-06-26,5,They sound gross but........They are AWESOME
1803611854,95926,2015-01-04,0,"This is very close to a recipe that I have used for years, but let me tell you how to make it better:&lt;br/&gt;Add 1 Tbs of white sugar to recipe, but mash everything together in a bowl or food processor, spread on bread and enjoy."
2000355338,95926,2015-07-22,5,"Sounded odd when I heard the recipe (sorry for being French :) ), but it actually tastes very good, perfect balance between sweetness of banana and bread against the acidity of mayo. Sometimes it does not have to be more complicated than that !!"
2000533197,95926,2015-10-07,5,"I grew up eating this, but I&#039;ve had friends try it and love it.  Though they thought they wouldn&#039;t.  You have to use dukes mayo to make this work, though."
2000912079,95926,2016-03-09,5,"I don&#039;t like mayonnaise but tryed it without and it worked - was unsure if it really would but it did.
Looking into crisp sandwiches next wonder if ready salted is they right thing?"
2834180,95926,2017-01-30,5,"I love this recipe! I'm a 60s baby and I've been eating these all my life. Maybe it's justa Southern thing? Who knows? But, alas, I think these are awesome!"
2001569573,95926,2017-06-05,0,"Do NOT use overly ripe bananas. The bananas should be yellow and ready to eat, but not very ripe."
2000188242,95926,2017-12-23,5,"Guess it's a Southern &quot;thang&quot;, because I've been eating banana sandwiches my entire life! Sooooo good!! I slice my bananas long ways, use ONLY Dukes Mayonnaise and 2 slices of soft, white sandwich bread, THAT'S IT, NOTHING ELSE NEEDED!! So simple, yet so delicious!! Thank you, Mr. Lagasse, for posting an actual recipe and bringing attention to this old Southern delicacy. I was JUST now eating one and decided to Google it to see if it was just something my mother fed us as children alone or if it was an actual &quot;thang&quot;!! lol I'm so pleased to see so many other people enjoy these delicious sandwiches!! Mmmmm, think I'll have another!!"
2002174000,95926,2018-06-03,1,totally agree mayo and banana doesnt work
111342,166476,2006-06-21,5,"SUPER good!  Very easy and incredibly fast.  I added sliced avocado and green onions and what was supposed to be the side dish, turned into the highlight of my meal!  Will be making this again, thanks for posting!"
199848,166476,2007-04-25,4,"A very good, colorful, versatile salad.  I used medium salsa and low-fat ranch dressing.  I thought it needed onions, so I added some.  If I had fresh tomatoes (especially homegrowns) I think I'd use them in place of the salsa.  Thanx for a nice salad lunch.  I'll whip this again when I'm in the mood for a quick satisfying salad!"
374520,166476,2007-07-19,5,This is a perfect summer dish!  I leave out the ranch dressing because none of here like it and I cook some ground Bison with taco seasoning.  Even the kids love this salad!  Thanks for sharing.
1129191,166476,2010-07-23,5,"I needed a salad without mayonnaise, and this really was good. I used kidney beans with taco seasoning and fresh salsa (because I ran out of bottled), and everyone really enjoyed it. This is definitely a recipe keeper for hot summer days and BBQs!"
498271,370567,2012-08-01,4,"What a fun recipe!  You're right, it did take me a couple of tries to get the cheese right - had to find the right balance of time and temperature.  I used monterrey jack cheese and corn tortillas.  Served with salsa of course and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT8, Chefs gone WILD!"
107135,370567,2012-08-03,5,this is a good snack after the tortilla was on cheese i twirled it a little to get even distributioni used swiss cheese and flour tortilla really good stuffzaar world tour 8
400708,370567,2012-08-05,5,This is such a fun recipe and it was easy once you get the hang of it.  For me the trick was not to be in too much of a hurry with flipping the tortilla and cheese over giving it time to reach the right stage.  I like this so much better than regular quesadilla and instead of a snack had it for breakfast.  Added salsa and sour cream to the topping when eating and it was a pleasant light breakfast.  I'm thinking even the grandkids will like this one - specially if I add a few pepporonis to it on completion.  Made for ZWT 8 the Mexican leg
526666,370567,2012-08-08,5,"I love the fact that you say it may take more than one try to get the cheese right. I did need a second try, but it was surely worth the first mistake, that was tasty, nonetheless. You really do need a nonstick pan, so I dug my non-stick wok out, to insure great cheesy coverage. I used a pepper jack, which was a good choice. Nice and crunchy, this stood alone, tho I may have one with guac for lunch today! :D Would be great, as an alternative to grilled cheese, with a steaming bowl of tomato soup! I plan to remember this, when winter comes...Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Cookgirl!"
373020,370567,2012-08-12,4,"My kids enjoyed these for lunch, made for ZWT8, The Fearless Red Dragons"
949568,370567,2012-08-12,5,"very tasty, I like how it melted the cheese, and then the tortilla was a bit crunchy.  My kind of snack, quick and tasty and easy to clean up after!  Thanks Cookgirl!  Made for ZWT8 trip to Mexico."
361931,370567,2012-08-12,5,"Oh my gosh, we LOVE these things -- you can make it with any cheese, any time, and any size tortilla!  YUMMY!"
80998,327979,2008-12-03,5,"I gotta admit that I wasn't sure I would like this.  However, I did.  It isn't sweet, so if you are looking for a ""milkshake smoothie"" look elsewher.  However, there is so much natural flavor and natural sweetness that it taste wonderful.  It certainly did put a pring in my step this morning.  Thanks Mike.  Made for bevy tag 2008."
464080,327979,2009-06-05,5,"Wow. . .this SO reminds me of Mexico. . .sitting by the pool with a plate of fresh fruit!  I did sub cantaloupe for the honeydew with excellent results.  The papaya really stands out here.  Mine was too thick for my blender, so I threw in 3 oz of unsweetened pineapple juice.  I love low calorie smoothies like this.  I am going to put a little in the fridge and mix it with some vodka tonight for a fruity martini. . .we shall see how that works!!!  Made for Veg*n Tag June 2009."
128473,327979,2009-06-19,5,"Another awesome smoothie from Syd. This was so good. I love melons in smoothies. The flavors blend really nice is this tropical smoothie. I especially love the flavor that the papaya brings to the mix. I used all frozen fruit for this, so I mixed in a little pineapple juice. Thank you so much for sharing this tasty treat."
679953,327979,2009-07-10,5,"GREAT SMOOTHIE YOU GOT HERE MIKE !!  Great combo of ingredients, and flavors.  Kind of reminded me of the days, that I was in South Texas near Mexico.  I did add a tad pineapple juice to this.  Made for PRMR tag."
1429901,471666,2014-01-21,0,"Note to reviewers: I want to give this recipe a 5-star rating, but the stars wouldn&#039;t stay red!"
44757,101115,2004-10-03,0,"This is known as a ""Loco Moco"". It has been said that it originated on ""The Big Island"" in Hilo. You can find it almost anywhere in Hawaii, and is one of my favorite breakfast meals! You might also want to try a version that was served at a bar I used to work at in Manoa. Instead of brown gravy, they used chili, thus the ""Chili-Loco""!
"
143318,223242,2007-04-26,5,Very good! This would be nice on all kinds of salads.
487387,223242,2007-05-01,5,"Thanks for a great dressing recipe. I made up a double batch with wine ripen tomatoes and basil. It was very tasty.
Tee"
231054,223242,2007-05-08,5,"Yes, the addition of the soy sauce is a little different -- but this is just AWESOME!!!  I picked up some baby Heirloom tomatoes at the grocery store yesterday and used them.  I also had some of the small fresh mozzarella balls and added them (I cut the tomatoes and mozarella balls in half -- just so they could absorb more of the dressing.  I had some green onions that I added also.  This is sooooo simple to put together and the flavor is outstanding.  The dish looked so attractive -- all the various colors of the Heirlooms, the cheese and the green onion.  The next time I make it (which will be very soon), I'm going to add some fresh basil.  I can't wait to serve this at our next barbecue.  Plus I didn't have any Tamari on hand, so I just used plain soy sauce.  I want to use the Tamari the next time.  Thank you for posting this."
156034,223242,2007-05-14,4,"Very good.  I really enjoyed it, but think that next time I will lessen the balsamic vinegar to 2 Tbsp. instead of 3 as it overpowered the tomato in my opinion.  All my guests liked it and requested the recipe.

Thanks Trinkets....another keeper!!"
486725,223242,2007-06-19,3,I put the dressing over tomatoes and topped it with arugula. It was a good salad. The soy is definitely subtle.
537188,126072,2008-01-27,5,I usually always manage to make my pastry go hard and brittle but this worked out really well - it was nice and soft!
476326,126072,2009-12-24,4,"Soft, tender crust, but a pain to try to roll.  I finally gave up and pressed it into place by hand.  That's definitely my suggestion!  I'd use it again though."
1701315,126072,2012-03-30,5,"I've never made a pie crust using milk before.  This was a wonderfully tender crust and had good flavor.  I also had trouble rolling it out, but it patted into the tin nicely and tasted fantastic, so no complaints here!"
679689,152441,2008-01-27,2,I guess ginger is just not my thing.
87577,31984,2003-05-30,5,"This is a wonderful ""make a memory"" for children, plus it is a delicious dessert.  I've used strawberries, peaches, raspberries, and blueberries - all equally good.  The grandchildren ask to make Granmom's ice cream each time we visit!"
231661,31984,2006-07-11,5,"This is a great recipe to make with the kids - they LOVED it!  We couldn't wait for it to freeze before eating and it was sooooo delicious.  The taste of naturally, sweet strawberries were wonderful.  My DS has already asked for blueberry ice cream for tomorrow!   Thanks for sharing.  Yum!! "
268778,31984,2006-09-23,5,"It is an easy and very lovely ice cream.  My DH, mother-in-law and myself enjoyed it very much, even though my DH never likes brought strawberry ice cream.  
However, I changed the procedure a little bit as it is stated in the 'Zaar' dictionary that it is better to add sugar at the end of whipping the cream so it will increase the size more and stand longer.  So I mixed the half frozen strawberry with sugar in the food processer before adding to the whipped cream in the blender.  I made 3 servings the first time.  However, my DH, MIL and I all agreed that the amount was enough for 6 servings after a main meal, so it meant that we only have 261/2 carloies each.
When I made it the second time, I blendered it again when it started frozen again, the texture was much creamy.
Thank you for sharing."
70662,31984,2006-09-25,5,this was so easy and so good-- i love how creamy it is for how little effort you have to put in!
392154,31984,2006-11-22,5,this recipe was great and i didnt even use a food processor! i used a blender and it turned out great!
781392,31984,2008-04-15,0,This was a wonderful alternative for homemade ice cream.  I made this for my husband on an extremely hot day when I wanted some ice cream (I had all the ingredients) and came across this recipe.  It provided almost instant gratification.  I had no idea where the ice cream maker was and it was too hot to look.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and my husband could not tell.  Great for when you want something yummy that is not a smoothie!
592157,31984,2008-06-30,5,"This turned out much better than I had expected. It's very close to the ""real"" thing. Great result for the time and effort. 
Thank you for sharing."
1762248,480558,2012-09-09,5,"""Peel your bananas first...""  No kidding!"
2002314120,250024,2018-10-28,1,"Am I something? I count only 6 ingredients-pb, flour, sugar, egg, cinnamon and nutmeg."
149363,152441,2006-01-20,5,"Well I was looking for a different way to prepare carrots and saw this was recently posted. WOW!! Delicious! I love the addition of the brown sugar and ginger, they go together great with carrots. I will be making this one again.
Thanks Mama!"
229619,152441,2006-01-24,5,Yummy carrots!  We'll be having this again and again.
169969,152441,2006-01-26,5,These are wonderful!!! I love the flavors! It is as if ginger and brown sugar were invented just for carrots!! Thanks Hope for a fabulous carrot recipe!
227831,152441,2006-01-28,5,"I also like to make carrots this way but I like to use fresh ginger root, about 1/2 to 1 tsp chopped fine.

I OFTEN make them in the microwave, which means you throw the above ingredients into a glass casserole along with about 1 T. water, cover it with plastic wrap, and micro cook for 6 to 8 minutes right when you are ready to serve."
89831,152441,2006-01-29,5,These are just delicious! I increased the brown sugar slightly. Thanks mama!...Kitten:)
131807,152441,2006-01-30,5,"This is a great recipe. I think next time, I may increase the brown sugar a little bit, but was definitely great as is. Thanks for posting. "
293086,152441,2006-02-16,5,"I made this tonight.  It is my favorite way of making carrots (although in a crockpot with a roast is pretty good too.)

Good: easy:  a way of getting some vegetables!"
86764,152441,2006-03-02,5,"Another rave for you, Hope.  Missy (next door neighbor) came over and asked me if I knew how to make glazed carrots.  This is the only recipe I ever use, but haven't rated it (I'm a lazy bones sometimes!)  She gave it a rave, but left out the ginger because she didn't have any.  Said it was just like the school's (which she loves - our school had good food!).  Rylee (her DD) also gobbled these up...well, part of them.  The other part ended up in the floor, on the high chair, and in her hair.  :D"
278113,152441,2006-03-03,5,"I was leary of the ginger when I first read this recipe. But, with all the rave reviews I had to see for myself. And it is REALLY good!!! I will never make them any other way again! Thanks for a fantastic recipe."
129992,152441,2006-03-12,5,Yummy! Nice light ginger taste...I'll make these again!
217726,152441,2006-03-22,4,The taste of the carrots were good and it is easy to make. I guess with all the 5 star ratings I was excepting a little more yumminess!
244817,152441,2006-03-23,5,I had this for lunch today. It was very good. This is one of the few ways that I like to carrots. Good Basic recipe. Thanks for posting!
274866,152441,2006-03-23,4,"Yummy recipe, will make again! Will probably try with less ginger."
239229,152441,2006-05-06,5,"These carrots were soo delicious!!! I usually dread eating carrots because of a bitter flavor, but this recipe made them easy to eat! I now OFFICIALLY LOVE carrots! Thanks so much for submitting this recipe! Will make again and again!"
65720,152441,2006-06-21,5,"These were delicious! What a nice accent the ginger provides and it pairs so well with the carrot flavor. I halved the recipe, since there were just the two of us and used Sugar Twin brown sugar substitute and light butter without adversely affecting the quality of the recipe.Thanks, Mama, for posting this- we'll enjoy it often!"
209255,152441,2006-06-27,5,"My Mom used to add brown sugar and butter to her carrots so I do it as well now.  But I had never added ginger!  WOW!  That gives it a delightful flavour.  There is just enough ginger in there that you don't really ""taste"" it, it is just there.  Perfect!  Thanks!"
205100,152441,2006-08-17,5,HUGE hit in my family!  I make these several times a month. My daughter will not eat any other kind of cooked carrots. Awesome.
269198,152441,2006-09-22,5,These are so yummy! The ginger really helps them out. I also like to add some cinnamon. I've also substituted orange juice for the butter. Less fat.  
230258,152441,2006-09-24,5,"These carrots are definatley 24k!!! The ginger you couldn't really taste which made this recipe have a unique flavor. I loves it and I can't believe how simple it was!
Thanks for the recipe mama's kitchen!"
329056,152441,2006-10-01,4,"These carrots were delicious. The sauce was yummy. The taste of the sauce didn't really infuse itself into the carrots, but when I re-dipped the carrots in it... YUM! I mixed the sauce into some rice I had, and you should definitely try it. Good stuff."
57162,152441,2006-10-02,4,Made last night for family.  My seven year old asked for seconds.  I did double the sauce as I didn't think the first batch made enough.  Great recipe - a keeper for sure!
98336,152441,2006-10-23,5,"This was an easy recipe- and believe it or not-- my 8yo daughter (non-veggie eater) even asked for a second helping of carrots! 

OK, so I said there was caramel sauce on them...  I used chopped ginger from a jar..  Definately a keeper!"
138429,152441,2006-11-06,5,  We loved these carrots. I do like ginger and the balance of the ingredients was perfect. So very easy to make and  with  such great flavorI served them with pork chops and  brown rice. They will be a great addition come holiday time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
356062,152441,2006-11-15,5,I can not thank you enough for this recipe! My father who has not been able to eat much and has zero appetite because of his illness had more that half of this recipe!!!!!! That says A LOT about these carrots. I had to whip up another batch so my whole family could have some with their dinner. Thank you thank you!
222055,152441,2006-11-30,4,I made these for dh as a quick side for his work lunch (Spam and mustard sandwiches). He loved them and said they complimented the sandwiches well. He also said it made carrots much more enjoyable to eat. I love how easy they are to cook and I used the microwave suggestion of another review to steam the carrots. I let dh do the rating as I am not the carrot lover. My little one still preferred them raw. Thank you mama's kitchen !!!
126104,152441,2006-12-02,5,"I totally enjoyed these.  Not only were they simple, but delicious.  I might try fresh ginger the next time, because I love an intense ginger flavor, but these are a winner just as they are.

I just upped the stars.  I saved a small amount of these and reheated them after 3-4 days.  I liked them even better.  I had them tonite with just a simple pot pie."
142559,152441,2006-12-03,4,"Fantastic carrots! Served at a Christmas party and they were a hit! I personally don't care for carrots, but did find these very good!  Super easy to make - no baking! LOL! I steamed these and then tossed in the sauce."
405313,152441,2006-12-17,5,"I made these yummy carrots for a holiday dinner party we had last night and they were a huge hit. My mother-in-law especially enjoyed them. :) It must be the ginger in this recipe that really makes it special. I will definately be doing carrots this way again. Thanks, mama's kitchen!"
59473,152441,2006-12-19,5,These carrots were great. The ginger added a nice flavour. Like another reviewer I cooked them in the microwave. Thanks
394077,152441,2007-01-08,5,Delish and so easy to do. Thank you mama for the recipe
248772,152441,2007-01-24,2,"Not our favorite...kids did not like and they love carrots, but I think it is a adult food. Thanks for sharing."
359220,152441,2007-01-31,0,"I think I need to rate this without stars, as I left out the ground ginger (I think mine wasn't up to par).  But boy or boy, you can't beat tender carrots with brown sugar and butter...I think I ate this entire recipe myself over a day or two!!!  Yum!"
446610,152441,2007-02-09,5,Made these to go with the kids' lunch today.  I have used a similiar recipe in the past that had honey in place of the brown sugar and I think we prefer it your way.  YUM!
309368,152441,2007-03-11,4,Simple and tasty!
168416,152441,2007-03-29,0,"These had good flavor, BUT, I did not rate them because I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and microwaved them. I have never done that before and DO NOT recommend it. The first batch I made using the directions given in the review resulted in horribly shriveled and overcooked carrots. The second batch, I halved the amount of cooking time and still they came out shriveled and overcooked but somewhat edible. However, as I stated before, the flavor was still good. So, next time I will go back to making them via stovetop and I'm sure I will love them!"
129031,152441,2007-04-16,4,"great flavor, I steamed them also. very tasty."
58836,152441,2007-04-17,5,"Yum, I love carrots and these were very good.  I didn't add the ginger and they were just as good.  Thanks, I'm sur4 I will make again."
458309,152441,2007-04-17,4,"We loved these carrots!  I steamed them using my steamer, then just coated with the sauce.  Fast and easy! Thanks for posting."
487248,152441,2007-04-20,5,These carrots were so yummy! Full of flavor. We will be making these again!!
274719,152441,2007-05-01,5,"For not being a big of carrots, I sure gobbled these down quick.  I used honey flavored butter instead of regular and fresh ginger instead of dried.  I will be making this again and again!"
295565,152441,2007-05-21,1,I followed this recipe exactly and there was absolutely no flavour.  Sorry.  Didn't like it.  :(
227607,152441,2007-05-25,5,Made these for ZWT 07...The kids loved them and want me to make them again tomorrow.  Very yummy way to get the kids to eat their carrots.  I think I used a little more brown sugar than called for.
219318,152441,2007-05-27,4,"These were quick and easy to throw together, and I thought the butter and ginger flavors came through very well.  It needed more brown sugar though.  But that might have been my fault.  I wasn't sure whether to firmly pack the brown or not, so I measured it somewhere in between.   Made for Zaar World Tour III."
394604,152441,2007-05-28,5,"I have made these little beauties a couple of times so far. They taste great. I used baby carrots the first time and regular sliced carrots the second. The ginger makes the recipe, in my opinion. They are mighty tasty and I think the kiddies would like these, too."
223854,152441,2007-05-28,5,"I made this for *Zaar World Tour III*
I sliced the carrots in half and baked them in the oven for 40 mins at 190oC and when they were finished cooking I poured the ""dressing"" over the carrots.  They tasted wonderful, Little Miss (DD) really enjoyed them she wanted second serving.  Thank you Mama's Kitchen for posting your recipe"
222478,152441,2007-05-29,5,These were fantasic! Had both a slightly caramelised and sweet taste from the sugar and the ginger just really set things off.
231054,152441,2007-05-29,5,"So simple, but so, so good.  I didn't double the sauce -- but I think I was a little short on the amount of carrots I used, so it worked fine.  But if I have the entire pound of carrots, I think I'll do as others suggested and double the sauce -- it's certainly yummy enough to have double the amount!!!"
183964,152441,2007-05-30,5,A very nice dish. There's a lot of flavor here! These went along very nicely with Charmies corned beef brisket. I cooked the carrots in the brisket broth and the pickling spice added a very nice flavor. A perfect side for your next corned beef meal. Try them!
324621,152441,2007-05-30,4,These were pretty good. Made them to go with our steak and shrimp dinner along with some seasoned pasta and fresh honeydew melon. Very nice meal and these carrots were a lovely addition!
222139,152441,2007-05-30,5,Excellant!  You can make this dish in no time.  Well worth trying.
507233,152441,2007-06-01,5,Best carrots I have EVER had.  PERIOD!
361931,152441,2007-06-01,5,"I have been looking a long time for a good glazed carrot recipe -- and have found it!  My little carrot expert (2 year old son) LOVED them, as did hubby and myself.  Picky daughter even said they were good and she would eat some next time -- since she waited until after dinner to actually taste them."
275438,152441,2007-06-07,5,I don't like cooked carrots but this made them great!!  We will definitely be eating more carrots!  I doubled the sauce like suggested but probably could have just done normal.  Thanks for posting!
265954,152441,2007-06-08,5,"Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.  So delicious, quick and simple, and leaves your kitchen smelling like the sweet scent of ginger.  Note:  sugar burns quickly, so be sure to heat the sugar over low heat and stir often.  Thanks for posting."
199848,152441,2007-06-14,5,"Sweet with a hint of ginger.  Just perfect.  These are great for kids and ""grown-up"" enough for adults.  I may have used a bit extra ginger; I didn't measure it.  Thanx for sharing this.  I'll be making these again."
353579,152441,2007-06-17,5,"This has plenty of great reviews, but I'll chime in with one more.  I make glazed carrots often, but the addition of just a bit of ginger sets this apart and I'll definitely add it next time I make them.  Thanks for sharing, mama!"
505325,152441,2007-06-22,5,"Mama, these are absolutely great!  I mixed the sauce separately and poured it over the sliced carrots which I had in a glass bowl, covered it with plastic wrap as recommended by MollyJ, and microwaved it 6 minutes.  Perfection...."
107135,152441,2007-06-25,5,great carrots  the ground ginger is inspired
74652,152441,2007-06-29,4,This is the way my Mother always made carrots and now the way I make them.  Always a must on the Thanksgiving and Easter table!  Thanks for sharing!
261510,152441,2007-06-29,5,I can't make carrots any other way now!  So easy and great flavor.  I steamed the carrots then added them to the mixture.  They were loved by all.  Thanks!
103876,152441,2007-07-01,5,Very good carrots!  This recipe is simple to make and the flavor of the sauce really compliments the carrots.  I used baby carrots and fresh ginger.  My daughter was still eating the leftovers after dinner was over.  I think that's a good sign!
130663,152441,2007-07-05,5,"Love it,,Will make again"
442988,152441,2007-07-05,4,"Very good.  It was a bit too sweet for my tastes -- I found the natural sugar in the carrots didn't need that much extra richness.  Next time I'll cut the sugar/butter glaze in half for the same amount of carrots, so it's just the slightest hint of extra sweetness.  Thanks for a good recipe!"
20480,152441,2007-07-07,5,"I served these carrots with my meal last night.What a great surprise; we loved them.I made them for Zingo; thanks for posting.
Rita"
352845,152441,2007-07-16,5,"When your teenagers ask for carrots with dinner, you know you've got a winner.  Great recipe!"
140132,152441,2008-01-26,5,My family loved these. What a great idea to add the ginger.  I feel that is what makes this dish so special.  Its that wow factor.  Thank you for posting this simple side dish that is sure to please....Stephanie
250031,152441,2008-01-27,4,Family liked them! We don't eat carrots much but everyone liked these so I'm adding them to the family menu.
339260,152441,2007-07-23,5,"These carrots are superb!  I had a 1 lb bag of baby carrots left over from a veggie tray I made for by DIL's baby shower.  I did an ingredient search for carrots to find a different way to use these up.  I like glazed carrots and I like ginger.  When I read this recipe, I knew I couldn't go wrong.  I use an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  These were the best glazed carrots that I have ever had.  The ginger and the brown sugar are a wonderful combination.  I am putting this recipe in my binder of ""special"" recipes.  I would like to try these with fresh, grated ginger root as some of the others suggested.  Thanks for another amazing recipem, mama!"
344069,152441,2007-08-13,4,A great way to get a toddler to eat his carrots!  Yummy!
559316,152441,2007-08-16,4,Made this for dinner tonight. Went over well. I doubled the sauce. Thanks for posting!
573224,152441,2007-08-28,4,Very good! I used fresh ginger that I minced but I didnt taste it at all in the end. The sauce was still very good though!!
547357,152441,2007-08-31,5,Very very good!
281132,152441,2007-09-01,5,oh these are sooooooooo good. i just prepared them today prior to a family gathering tomorrow. i was intending to heat them quickly in the microwave tomorrow. and guess what? i've eaten the lot of them. for sure i am making these often.  thanks for a lovely recipe - i am sure my kids will be encouraged to eat healthily with these (thats if i leave them any). Great!!!
566275,152441,2007-09-04,5,Simplicity itself.  Would probably increase the ginger next time.
473347,152441,2007-09-11,5,"Wow! This was amazing. I can't stand ginger normally but this converted me. I steamed the carrots and whipped up some rice. And I mixed the rice and coated carrots together. A great, filling, fairly healthy meal (better than the potato chips I was going to eat). For a little kick I added some crushed red peppers. I will take this recipe with me when I head off to college."
494068,152441,2007-10-04,5,"I make these all the time, only use cinnamon instead of the ginger.  Always a hit in my house.  Thanks!"
332670,152441,2007-10-05,5,"These carrots are definitely yummy! My son who is 3 1/2 does not like carrots,but he sure did like these. Even my 16 year old like them. I will be making these a lot. Thank you so much for posting."
467341,152441,2007-10-14,5,I love carrots and this was a great recipe.
13483,152441,2007-10-17,5,Excellent veggie dish.  I made the dish a day ahead of my dinner party and just gently nuked it to warm it up.  Worked like a charm.  Added a nice colour to the plate and a good taste to the pallet.  Thanks for the post mama's kitchen.
88569,152441,2007-10-18,4,"These were good, the rest of the family liked them better than I did. I think next time I will add a bit more brown sugar and only use 1/4 t. of ginger (I usually like ginger but the taste was quite strong). Great twist on carrots, thanks!"
446738,152441,2007-11-18,5,Very tasty!  I added just a little bit of kosher salt for a little more flavor.  Husband and daughter loved them.
173880,152441,2007-11-23,5,Made this as part of our Thanksgiving dinner! Thanks!!
68023,152441,2007-11-26,4,Not too bad!  I was skeptical but it really does have a nice flavor!  (Make sure you cut down the ingredients in the sauce if you don't have as many carrots.)
305531,152441,2007-12-06,5,What can I say that hasn't been said already? These are really yummy and were the star of our dinner last night. I steamed the carrots ahead and heated them up right before dinner. Thanks Hope for a wonderful new side dish.
58104,152441,2007-12-11,5,"CANDY!!!!!
Yes this is like eating candy so buttery sweet!
 I used 1 1/2 pounds of carrots 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger, 2 tablespoons butter and brown sugar! I served with recipe #142483. Thanks Hope!"
591307,152441,2008-01-02,4,"Lovely recipe, and one I will be repeating often. I didn't use the ginger in my recipe.  Made for Christmas dinner and it went so well with my roast!  Loved this recipe.  Thank you Mama! Debbie"
61660,152441,2008-01-02,5,"Great carrots!  I used the last of the ones I had stored from our garden.  I sliced up regular orange carrots as well as white and purple carrots.  Very pretty together (the white carrots did pick up a little purple hue,lol).  Loved the sweetness of this recipe, it so enhanced the carrot flavor."
468146,152441,2008-01-10,4,"mama's kitchen, the carrots were tastely. After reading the reviews I used fresh ginger root and a little more brown sugar. I also added some cinnamon for extra flavor. It was a great way to sneak carrots in on the family."
8688,152441,2008-01-18,5,"Delicious simple and easy to put on your table!  Thanks, Mama's Kitchen!"
659588,152441,2008-01-24,5,"These were absolutely great.  Really enhances the natural sweetness of the carrots. Made them with little shatanay carrots, halved lengthways. I cooked 500g for my little boy and I, and we ate the lot! Ive passed the recipe onto my friend whos little boy has an aversion to veg, with the promise ""he WILL eat these!"" :o) thank you very very much for the recipe."
352738,152441,2008-01-30,5,Rave reviews from my family this last Easter.  I was looking for soemthing simple and just a little different but not so much so fussy eaters wouldn't try it.  This was a real winner and really fit the bill.  I had many requests for the recipe and have had them ask for it again.  Think I will add to my Easter menu every year thank you!
191533,152441,2008-02-05,5,"Superb! The flavor is great! I like a thicker sauce that sticks to the carrots, so I blend in a little mixture of cornstarch and water after the other sauce ingredients. Delicious; thanks for sharing!"
130133,152441,2008-02-05,5,"This is so good, and it is simple to prepare!  My husband raved about the carrots.  Thanks for sharing!"
68960,152441,2008-02-09,4,These are nice.  Easy to make and went well with our lamb shanks. My brown sugar didn't melt that well even though the pan was low.
731434,152441,2008-02-10,4,These are sweet like lollies!
355058,152441,2008-02-10,4,These are sweet and yummy!
202431,152441,2008-03-12,1,Looks like I am definately in the minority here. I followed the recipe exactly and even steamed the carrots hoping to lock in the flavor but the end result was not at all what I expected... just simply had no taste. Sorry but I won't be making these again.
369715,152441,2008-03-12,4,These are good and easy to make. I used canned carrots as that is all I had tonight and needed a quick side dish. I followed the recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed these. Thanks for a different way to make carrots.
587114,152441,2008-03-31,5,"It's all been said already, wonderful carrots! Even my 6 year old ate them up!  For the Freezer Tag game, these carrots froze beautifully.  I added about a teaspoon of water to the finished product, stuck them in the freezer, and thawed and reheated them later."
332211,152441,2008-04-03,4,"Ginger really gives the carrots a little zip.  Hesitant to try, but so glad I did."
389431,152441,2008-04-07,4,"Good down home kinda flavor. Sweet, but not candied...  you could still taste the carrot! I will be using this one again! Thanks!"
675287,152441,2008-04-08,5,"Made these along with corned beef and cabbage.  They went great!  The only change I made was to use cinnamon instead of the ginger.  Simple, quick and delicious!  Thank you Mama for this one!"
537188,152441,2008-04-19,5,This is such a nice way to prepare carrots : it's so simple and yet...so tasty!
377581,152441,2008-04-21,4,"These were nice for a change!Easy to make and tasty. A subtle change to the usual carrot taste. I felt there was too much glaze, so next time I'll reduce the butter and sugar by half, but keep the ginger just as is. Thank you for such a simple flavorful recipe! I'll be making these again."
538098,152441,2008-05-16,4,"Quick, easy, and a nice change of pace."
125640,152441,2008-07-19,3,"Simple sweet, buttery side dish. If nothing else, good basic microwave carrots. Incredibly easy to make in just minutes without taking up space on the stove. I thought they tasted pretty good. DH didn't like them, but we both prefer raw carrots anyway. Thanks for sharing."
638072,152441,2008-07-30,3,Well I had to try this after reading it comes from Texas!  I was born and bred there.  I didnt like the sweet in the recipe.  I think Im just a salty veg kinda person.  But thats just me!!  Thanks!
422609,152441,2008-08-01,4,These were delicious!  Our new favorite way of preparing carrots as a side dish.
399657,152441,2008-08-05,5,Nuked and eyeballed everything using baby carrots.  Doesn't get much easier than that!
383206,152441,2008-09-15,2,"I was going to make this for Thanksgiving based on all of the amazing reviews, but I am so happy that I tested the recipe first.  I followed the recipe exactly, and he ginger was not at all complimentary to the carrots. We love carrots and these actually got tossed. I am sorry, I guess this is just not suited to our taste at all."
288351,152441,2008-09-16,4,"I made it according to the recipe.  Everyone liked it, but I thought it would have been better without as much (or any) ginger."
801264,152441,2008-09-27,5,Yummy! The portion of dressing to carrots is perfect. The flavors complemented the carrots very nicely. I steamed my carrots on the top rack of my rice cooker for 15min and they came out perfect. Thanks again!
29404,152441,2008-12-08,5,"Who Knew!  Just a little touch of ginger and what a treat.  I had to halve the recipe, used carrots on hand.  They got done b4 the rest of dinner, and I finally gave up the charade and just left a fork in them, a bite here, a bite there.  Ty for posting.  This goes to my Do Again list."
134624,152441,2008-12-10,4,"These were quite tasty. I steamed the whole baby carrots in a bamboo steamer, and served the carrots with smoked turkey drumsticks, and Buttery Parmesan Rice #201142.
The recipe was made as directed, using freshly grated ginger. I will probably make these again, with no changes."
55578,152441,2008-12-18,4,Good!  I like the addition of ginger.
495032,152441,2008-12-19,4,Tasty.  Thank you.
674484,152441,2008-12-26,5,These were a nice side dish to my dinner of Recipe #126492.  We had with mashed potatoes and  Recipe #261418.  What a delicious combination it was!
868673,152441,2009-01-05,5,These went great with my roast and mashed potatoes over the holidays.  Everyone enjoyed the sweetness and flavors from the brown sugar glaze.  I will use this recipe when I feel like making fresh carrots.  They were great for all of us!  Roni
768828,152441,2009-01-25,5,"I love these carrots.  I've made several times and can't belive I didn't review.  I usually use Smart Balance instead of butter, but are still really good.  Thanks"
362983,152441,2009-02-04,5,"Yummy! I always use carrots with other vegetables, so it was nice to use just carrots and make something very simple yet tasty at the same time! I sliced my carrots and sauteed them till they softened. A bit of water helped them along as well. I think I'll probably add more ground ginger next time since I think I added a touch less than recommended, or try fresh ginger for a nice little kick. I might microwave the carrots next time like other reviews have suggested and see how it compares time-wise. Hmm maybe some honey instead of brown sugar.. or even some herbs. Oh the possibilities.. :) Thanks for a lovely recipe!"
622972,152441,2009-03-22,5,These were good!  My hubby even ate a few and he hates carrots.
544754,152441,2009-06-02,4,"This was different from how I usually season my carrots, so it was nice. I liked the sweetness from the brown sugar, and the ginger taste in the background was subtle. I steamed this in the microwave according to MollyJ's tips and it turned out perfectly. Thanks!"
719083,152441,2009-06-19,5,This is how we like to cook our carrots and is my favorite type of carrots. We don't normally put ginger in but I had some so I chopped up finely (as MollyJ mentioned) and used that in there. This is just a nice easy way to give carrots some flavor. Thanks!
98761,152441,2009-06-22,5,I served this tonight to company along with a turkey dinner.  I enjoyed the carrots fixed this way.  Thank you.
577723,152441,2009-06-22,5,"I cooked the carrots in the microwave 1st, in a Ziploc ""Zip & Steam"" bag.  I do have to cut the cooking time in half or veggies will overcook. They were great!"
951589,152441,2009-07-06,5,"mmmm delicious!!!  I cooked mine in boiling water until they were soft and tender, then tossed them in the sauce.  I did add a litte extra brown sugar :)"
395940,152441,2009-07-13,5,"Really good variation on carrots!  Delicious, but not too sweet."
987323,152441,2009-07-28,5,My boyfriend and I thought these were great!  They were sweet and buttery.  This is such an awesome way to spice up ordinary carrots!
1049724,152441,2009-08-26,5,"I followed Mama's recipe and found that I prefer the less saucy version - to keep it healthy. The kids liked it, it was easy to make - I steamed baby carrots, then mixed them into a bowl with the brown sugar, butter and ground ginger.  Because the butter was not melted yet, I mixed what I could and then added the hot carrots, which then dissolved and turned the mix into the sauce.  I will be making this again."
633027,152441,2009-10-04,5,Very yummy!  Made these to go with dinner last night.  I used 1/2 lb of the frozen crinkle cut carrots.  I kept the sauce ingredients at 2 tbsp brown sugar and 2 tbsp margarine but decreased the ginger to 1/4 tsp which was plenty for my family's tastes. I'll definitely  increase the sauce ingredients in the future to make it more 'saucy' though.  I also think next time I'll try subbing cinnamon for the ginger because my family likes cinnamon on carrots and I think it will work well with this method.  Thanks for posting!!!!!!!!
158086,152441,2009-11-15,5,These were excellent carrots..I used splenda brown sugar and will be making these for our annual family xmas dinner at our Uncles...They will go perfect with his ham...thanks
353485,152441,2009-11-28,4,Super easy and got rave reviews from my guests though I thought they were quite sweet (made as written.)  Everyone at the table commented favorably on the ginger taste and one of my guests even asked to take the leftovers home; that alone is enough to ensure that this recipe will be made again.
1007259,152441,2009-12-02,0,"I cooked these a bit differently - mixed up the butter, sugar, and ginger, tossed raw carrots in it, and roasted them.  Maybe ground ginger doesn't hold up well to the heat, but I couldn't really taste it at all.  Since it might be my fault, I won't rate it, but I wanted to warn anyone else hoping to roast carrots this way."
1046155,152441,2009-12-13,5,"These are fabulous! My fiance bought a huge bag of baby carrots and I needed to find a way to fix them. Neither of us particularly like cooked carrots, but these are the exception! I steamed the carrots and microwaved the butter, brown sugar and ground ginger for 30 seconds. Then, I drained the water from the pan, added the carrots and sauce and voila! A ridiculously easy, DELICIOUS one-pot side! The ginger flavor isn't obvious, but gives these something extra."
126618,152441,2009-12-15,5,"Super Yummy!
My 5 year old ate all of the carrots on her plate.
My 3 year old asked for more.  When everyone was done I polished off the bowl. I will make these again."
1102065,152441,2009-12-28,5,This was an awesome recipe.  The flavors blended nicely.  I steamed the carrots first.  Thank you!
1239933,152441,2009-12-28,5,"What a yummy recipe! Totally simple and utterly delicious! My daughters (ages 5 and 3) both asked for second helpings, and my husband has asked me to make them again tonight! Thanks for posting!"
1200137,152441,2009-12-31,5,I steamed the carrots and they were very moist and flavorful! Yumm
221139,152441,2010-01-03,5,Very good!  Enhances carrots without masking their flavor.
329638,152441,2010-01-16,5,Very tasty!  Kids loved it. Thanks for posting!
653438,152441,2010-01-23,5,I saw this recipe this morning and just had to say I fix my carrots this way quite often only I use some fresh grated ginger...DH and I love these!  Thank you for posting.
1365025,152441,2010-01-28,5,"These are so good. I steamed my baby carrots first and then finished simmering them in this delicious sauce. I'm just cooking for one but I always make enough for two meals, shame on me but I ate all the carrots in one meal, that's how good they are."
384657,152441,2010-02-15,4,"I was hesitant to try this, b/c I usually don't care for sugar of any sort on any vegetables.  But we were glad I gave it a try.  The ginger gave it a nice kick and I will make it again.  I will probably cut back on the sugar next time though, just a little bit.  All in all, a nice recipe.  Thanks."
468351,152441,2010-03-18,5,Quick and delicious!
1348747,152441,2010-03-22,5,"A super easy, very yummy side dish."
173579,152441,2010-03-23,5,These are very tasty carrots and so easy to fix.  My family just loved them.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
333017,152441,2010-04-01,5,I have made something similar to this but used mustard instead of the ginger.  I quite liked the ginger/butter combination. I made this up the day ahead of time...undercooked the carrots a bit and placed them in the crockpot for about an hour.  Loved it!!  I will definately use this recipe again!!
415084,152441,2010-04-22,4,Great flavor. I used fresh carrots from the farmers market and sliced them instead of baby carrots. The ginger is the darling in this dish.
590640,152441,2010-04-23,4,"These were very good. I wasn't sure how my family was going to like the ginger, but my husband liked them and my 3 year old daughter ate all of hers! I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!"
355637,152441,2010-04-29,3,These were pretty good!
1437646,152441,2010-05-14,4,"I had to omit the ginger, because I have picky eaters and it still turned out great. The only other thing i did differently was to add a pinch of salt during cooking. I cookrd mine in the microwave, but added enough water so that at least 3/4 of the carrots were submerged."
184890,152441,2010-05-30,5,Perfect Carrot dish recipe.  Definitely 24k.  I substituted 2T orange juice for the butter  and also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Excellent taste.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
465829,152441,2010-06-03,5,"Most of the family really liked this. DH even took the leftover sauce and poured it over some ice cream with bananas for instant bananas foster dessert. I did add a small dash of cinnamon, just because that smelled right. My DD and I still agree that even with a sweet sugar coating, carrots are the most vile, evil vegetable ever created. ;) I will be making this again. One day, I may even taste it! Thanks! :)"
50969,152441,2010-06-20,4,"UPDATE On 6/20/10: I've made these carrots so many times and can't believe I've never posted a photo. Well, I've made these again and here's the photo. And I have to say they are just as good if not better than the first time they were made. My first time to review this recipe was November 3rd,2006
I just want to say that my SO and I really enjoyed these carrots very much.I thought that the ginger and brown sugar gave the dish that ""something special""that is usually missing from carrots.These will be made again,Thank you for posting."
228963,152441,2010-08-16,5,This was a simple and easy recipe to make. My entire family loved this. I will be making again soon. Thank you for posting!!!!
74281,152441,2010-11-16,5,"These are definitely delicious carrots and SO simple to make. I used a bag of baby carrots and just threw all of the ingredients into a pot with 1 cup of water. Then I brought it to a boil, covered the pan and reduced the heat to a simmer. I simmered the carrots covered for 15 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes until the sauce was reduced. My 80 year old Dad looked at the plate and said: ""CARROTS? YUK!"" I told him to just try 'em, and he did.... He then requested seconds!"
1154939,152441,2011-02-03,4,"Nice blend of flavors! My husband is not fond of carrots, but ate these and enjoyed them. My 5 yr old daughter liked them too. I did cut the ginger in half. They weren't too sweet and not too buttery. I'll definitely make them again."
633761,152441,2011-02-15,5,"Not that you need another 5 star review, but this recipe is super yummy!!  I'm not normally a huge fan of sweetened veggies, but the brown sugar and ginger was a great combo.  Even got my 4yo veggie hater to clean his plate!  That's saying something.  I melted the butter, brown sugar and ginger in a serving dish in the microwave. Then just added my boiled, sliced carrots and tossed to combine. Thank you for the great recipe!"
1832505,152441,2011-02-21,5,"Though I had to substitute ground ginger for fresh grated, these were delicious! I'll be making them again!"
75890,152441,2011-04-10,4,"I really liked these carrots and so did MOST of the family.  My husband only likes carrots that have been cooked to death, so that might attribute why he was not a fan.  I used fresh ginger as I had some on hand."
1084369,152441,2011-05-30,4,"I also steamed my carrots and then tossed them with sauce. Additionally, I reduced the sugar and butter by a tiny bit - still yummy, not too strongly flavored to scare off those who aren't exactly ginger fans."
344087,152441,2011-07-30,5,Thank you!!! I hated cooked carrots until now. Temporary following a low residue diet and need to eat well cooked or canned vegetables with no skin. I had some canned ones in the pantry that I knew I should use or donate. I made the sauce in a small skillet and tossed the drained carrots and heated till warm. I also added a little sauce to my plain white rice and it was very nice for a change. This would be great for the microwave or to make camping as it is super easy!!!
1530179,152441,2011-08-29,4,"Delicious carrots and very simple to make.  Similar to Sooz Cooks I tossed the ingrediants in a pot with a cup of water, brought to boil and reduced heat to low, everything was done in 15 minutes, I still like my carrots to have a little firmness to them and not be mushy.  Very easy!"
132010,152441,2011-10-17,5,I tried it and we loved it!  Very simple and I doubled the recipe. I steamed the carrots and then mixed in the sauce.  Very good.  Thanks for posting.
207257,152441,2011-12-25,4,pretty yummy and very easy!
316809,152441,2011-12-26,5,"Loved this very simple and elegant dish for Christmas dinner last night! The ginger really made the dish. I microwaved the sauce, but next time I'll do it on the stove. Everyone loved these! Thanks for a great recipe!"
928301,152441,2012-04-27,3,It was ok.  Needed to try to thicken the sauce on the heat a bit more.
1581225,152441,2012-07-29,4,Very sweet and tasty.
2378234,152441,2012-09-30,4,"these were amazing, simple to make and will definitely be done again.<br/><br/>I actually boiled them like Sooz Cooks suggested. Loved them!"
2474725,152441,2012-11-01,5,Yummm the ginger is perfect.
348926,152441,2012-11-23,5,"Needed one more vegetable for Thanksgiving, something quick, easy, tasty; this was it!  Thank you for posting."
175727,152441,2013-01-15,5,IF I could give this a 10 I would.. perfectly balanced sweetness and the ginger is SO perfect here!<br/><br/>Will use for tonight - St. Patrick's with our corned beef.<br/><br/>1/2013  Adding that these canned so well!!!!<br/>a
2661620,152441,2013-02-04,5,"Simple elegance! I sliced the carrots, then steamed them for 10 min, added other ingredients to the carrots with some carrot water, reduced sauce on medium heat for 5-10 minutes. This is a PERFECT side dish."
2742639,152441,2013-04-25,0,"Thank you, we never loved carrots!!! But now its a different story they are so sweet I have made them now 4 times, and my hubby loves them."
851405,152441,2013-04-29,4,"My oldest son and oldest daughter and I liked these.  My two younger sons and husband wouldn&#039;t even try them-they were, after all, carrots."
628076,152441,2013-10-21,4,Pretty tasty ... I did reduce the ginger by half but I will try if full strength next time. Thanks the hubs and kids liked them
486718,152441,2014-05-22,0,Yummy way to make carrots!  Thanks!!!
176615,152441,2015-01-07,5,Really good. Super fast and easy to fix. Thanks for the recipe!
165933,152441,2015-01-19,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  I have made it twice now, first with brown sugar and the second time with maple syrup sugar!  Both were a hit with everyone.  Thanks."
661864,152441,2015-01-30,4,"Delicious as is. Also very good using half parsnips, half carrots."
198154,152441,2015-03-08,3,"I made these for DH, as is the only one who likes cooked carrots in our house. He gave them 3 stars. He said they were &quot;okay&quot; and &quot;not bad, but not his favorite.&quot; Lots of leftovers."
2000335947,152441,2015-07-13,5,"I loved the recipe the way it came out. Its was awesome and my whole family loved it. Easy and tasty, thank you :) It tasted amazing with chicken and mayonnaise salad."
1949845,152441,2017-04-17,4,"I have made these twice in the last two weeks &amp; believe I'm onto something. The first time I made it &quot;as is&quot; with the addition of just a little cinnamon (plus the ginger called for in the recipe). The second time when I made it for Easter, I doubled the recipe but didn't double the butter (still adding the touch of cinnamon). I think I liked it better the second time because the sauce was thicker. Will definitely make again."
377366,152441,2017-06-13,5,"As a full time working mom, wife, etc. no time for steaming, washing pots &amp; all that entails. Cook carrots in microwave 3-5 minutes. Melt butter, add brown sugar &amp; ginger, parsley for color. A little salt to enhance flavor. Done in less than 10 minutes. One dish, minimum clean up. Simple, easy, healthy."
218535,152441,2017-10-15,2,too sweet
