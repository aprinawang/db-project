52476,181765,2006-08-15,5,"We have been eating this bbq sauce for years!  Fortunately for me I live in Northern Alabama and have access to the restaurant that originated the white bbq sauce (Big Bob Gibson's). It's my understanding that this white sauce is indicative only to Northern Alabama. The only way I have ever seen it eaten or have eaten it myself is with ""smoked"" chicken (either poured over the chicken after its done or used as a dipping sauce).  The combination of the smoked chicken and the tartness of the sauce is heavenly! I make this often in the Summer months and encourage everyone to give it a try!!  "
37722,181765,2007-03-12,5,"This is excellent and the same recipe I've always used except that we increased the amt. of pepper slightly, and added a little sugar and salt to boot. Never tried the red pepper but will. I lived for 34 years in Huntsville, AL before moving to St. Louis, and our favorite place to have white BBQ sauce was the old Greenbrier restaurant on Hwy 20. There we douse grilled chicken with the sauce, but a major treat is their heavenly hushpuppies, to which we also add the white sauce. I grill skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts pre-seasoned only with seasoned salt and serve the white sauce on the side when serving. And Sally's right: the sauce tastes a whole lot better after chilling for a few days. Finally, don't buy commercially bottled white BBQ sauce; it's usually awful. Thanks, Sally!"
135470,181765,2008-05-05,1,I did not care for this at all. All I could taste was the vinegar.
286566,352182,2011-02-16,4,"We really liked the marinade but next time I would use fresh oregano and also add some fresh rosemary (we are fortunate that both grow abuntantly all year round and I did double the garlic as we just love the fresh garlic we have harvested).  I cooked on an indoor grill (using 12 loin chops for 4 which were served up with 2 recieving 4 and the other 2 persons got 2 each which suited us).  I cooked on an indoor electric ridged grill 5 minutes per side which gave a well done to the smaller chops and a slight pink to the larger ones so everyone got what they liked.  Thank you Sara 76, made for Bargain Basement."
1802964648,424551,2014-07-25,4,When making this recipe be aware of the scoville heat units of your cayenne.  A half teaspoon of cayenne 40 is going to be less spicy than a cayenne 90.
49304,106241,2005-01-17,5,"Very good,I made 2 large onions made them just like the recipe stated. We really enjoyed them with Swordfish and a big salad. We love the syrupie balsamic sauce over the onion. Thank you Mermaidmagic, for the recipe."
37449,106241,2005-02-18,5,"I halved the recipe because it was just for me, but I wish I had made the full recipe, this was so good! I loved the intense taste of the reduced balsamic vienegar! Thanks mermaid!  :)"
52543,106241,2005-03-05,5,"If you love balsamic vinegar, this is a must try! Its also quick & easy. Thanx mermaidmagic!"
121690,63529,2005-01-06,4,I made this exactly as written. My family and I found it very enjoyable.
1609858,63529,2014-02-04,4,"I thought this sounded really strange, but I wanted to try it for my little guy who loves bananas.  We all enjoyed it!"
29782,129621,2008-11-07,5,"What a wonderful potato soup recipe! I made this for the cook-a-thon for stacy. She will be missed but her recipes live on. Stacy my friend  I know your in heaven looking down on all of us with a big smile.  My hubby really loved your potato soup (so did I )  he said and I quote "" This is the stuff ""  I added some chopped onion and onion powder to the potatoes along with a Tbs. of bacon grease.  Hubby ate so much that his belly was so full, he was growling on the sofa in pain from stuffing his self. LoL   
This was so easy to come together and ready in no time at all.  Thanks for posting this delicious soup! :)   I miss ya my friend!!"
317809,177644,2008-08-17,5,We gave this jam a try today. It was fun and easy to make. The aroma still fills my kitchen and we can't wait to try it out.
97901,177644,2009-07-17,5,"This worked out great! It is definately strawberrybanana-you can taste each. I was worried it wasn't going to set up b/c it was pretty runny when we went to bed, but it was solid the next morning. It took me about 5 bananas to get enough. I didn't add the butter to reduce the foaming and I would strongly reccomend adding it. I had a TON of foam to skim off!!!!!!"
91340,177644,2009-08-21,5,Lovely Strawberry banana jam. The Banana takes center stage in this one but isn't overpowering. My 14 year old son love this one on PB&J sandwiches. Pretty color and sets up nicely; a little loose but that is typical for home canned jams. Thanks for posting! :-)
1352668,177644,2009-08-23,5,This was really great jam.  My husband already asked me to make more so we won't run out!  The strawberry/banana combo complement each other so nicely.
134289,177644,2009-08-25,5,Yummy!!  Very easy to make!!
2282309,177644,2012-06-02,0,I doubled everything except the sugar and the pectin and it turned out perfect!
53959,112973,2006-01-28,5,You can never go wrong with potatoes. It is one of my favorite foods. I made it exactly like stated and it was delicious. Yummmm!!!!!
57042,112973,2007-03-07,5,I gave this 5 stars. My family loves mashed potatoes. I make mine very close to this except I use milk and black pepper. Thanks for posting a comfort recipe! Christine (internetnut)
174096,112973,2011-08-29,5,"Great and simple, as stated!  I used fat free evaporated milk and did not peel the potatoes first.  Thanks for sharing!  Veg*n Swap 37"
175827,304159,2008-10-05,5,This was so delicious!  It made it's own fantastic caramel syrup that we drizzled over top.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!
602094,304159,2010-05-16,5,"Wow this was so simple to make and so worth every minute. The hardest part was coring the apples. I did have to cook it a tad longer, but it's easy to see when they are done. The apples were cooked perfectly, the crust was so good and it went great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We drizzled some carmel on top of it all as well. I'll definitely be making these again!"
245642,38959,2005-09-23,5,It is so nice not to look in every cook book for this simple sauce :o)
200728,38959,2005-11-16,3,Easy to make.  
1237233,240311,2009-04-13,5,"This bread pudding tastes just like the ones served on Disney Property.  The Vanilla Sauce (Creme Anglaise) is essential to complete the dish.  

A few tips to help make the dessert great!!  

- Let white bread get stale for about a day or so to help absorb the egg mixture.  
- Cut of the crusts of the bread (at least half the loaf) to keep the pudding more smooth and less chewy.  
- I also added a tsp of vanilla to the egg mixture which enhanced the flavor as well!!"
37449,275526,2008-12-24,5,"So easy to make and yummy too! I used rice milk, didn't freeze my banana and used peanut butter that has flax and honey in it. Thanks for a nutritious drink!"
1328550,275526,2010-05-12,5,I was looking for a recipe that didn't use those pricey powders! Thanks.
1609858,275526,2013-06-27,4,"Wanted to use up some bananas that were getting overripe and thought my one year old would like this with breakfast.  He did!  I didn&#039;t try it myself as I&#039;m not big on banana flavored things and I also don&#039;t drink milk much either, so I figured I wouldn&#039;t like it.  Thanks for the idea."
2001480980,275526,2017-04-10,5,"This was really good! I used rice milk, added a little extra peanut butter and some cocoa powder as well."
135566,364186,2010-04-11,5,Great recipe to use for teaching a new cook.  My youngest niece wanted to learn how to make French toast so we used your recipe.  Turned out perfect! Made for Spring 2010 Pick A Chef.
424680,400243,2009-12-29,5,"What a fast, easy & interesting way to make a tasty sorbet! Making this recipe in my heavy-duty blender was a breeze! I look forward to trying it again with a combo of fruits! [Made & reviewed in the PRMR Holiday Special as a thank you for one of the new players!]"
690623,457496,2011-06-23,5,This is getting a five from bacon loving DH.  I must be a freak because I thought I would prefer it with less bacon. :)  I started this in a non stick pan that turned out to stick like heck!  When I inverted the plate (seriously hot btw) the bottom crust remained in the pan.  Undaunted I hauled out the pan I should have used in the first place - cast iron.  I stuck the bottom back on and finished them in that.  We thoroughly enjoyed these potatoes.  Thanks for posting.  Made for Food.Commandos ~ ZWT 7
204024,457496,2011-06-30,5,"Great comfort food, a central European take on hashed browned potatoes.  Unlike the previous reviewer I used my seasoned cast iron skillet from the beginning and it came out dark but perfect. I added a dollop of sour cream and could easily picture it alongside a couple of fried eggs. Very tasty and filling!"
400708,457496,2013-10-16,4,I had a baked potato left over from dinner and decided to use it to make this for our breakfast.  It truly went together pretty easy and I had no trouble with it sticking (I did use spray before starting) Loved the addition of the bacon and onions and I even added some sliced jalapenos that I had pickled from the garden.  It does remind me of crusty hash browns and we really enjoyed.  Right at the end I sprinkled with grated cheddar cheese and enjoyed that addition.
55594,65897,2003-07-23,5,"This is the first time I have made rice pudding.  I thought it had great flavor, although I used about 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I also used 1/4 tsp of the nutmeg and cinnamon on the top and I might use even more next time.  I loved the raisins in it!!  I did have a little trouble with the cooking time.  Next time I will let it cook for about 40-45 minutes before I stir it so that the rice and raisins will be mixed throughout all the pudding.  Most of my rice and raisins ended up at the bottom with the ""pudding"" part on the top.  Still tastes great though.  I just have to stir it up before I serve it."
156034,65897,2007-04-13,4,"I made this and followed the directions to the letter, but I didn't use raisins.

It was good, but a little dry for my taste. Next time I won't let it cook for the entire 50 minutes.  I ate it warm and haven't tried it cold yet.

I think next time I will also add a little more sugar, just for our tastes.

Easy recipe to follow and make...thank you for sharing."
222696,65897,2007-08-09,4,"This was a very good, albeit a bit dry, rice pudding. The flavors were spot-on, even though I left out the raisins. I actually used 1% milk and was still super pleased with how rich the dish was. I also appreciate how it uses leftover rice! The rice pudding was delicious both warm and cold with a little whipped cream. Writing this review is making me wish we hadn't eaten it all! Thanks for sharing your recipe; it's a solid one. :)"
319855,65897,2008-10-06,1,"I really didn't enjoy this, which was a shame, especially after all the great reviews
I found it to be much too eggy tasting, especially after it chilled.  I ate one bowl warm, but the rest will be going into the garbage unfortunately."
242396,65897,2009-02-12,4,"I cooked this once to the letter and also found it to be a little dry but second time cooked for 40 mins (till egg was set) and it was perfect.  I used express rice second time around as I wasn't having rice for dinner but wanted this, also used vanilla sugar as well as vanilla which made it nicer IMO!!! Thanks for a great recipe"
412186,65897,2009-04-15,4,I love rice pudding and this is very good. I used 2 % milk but I think the half and half would make it richer  oreven whole milk.
94090,65897,2009-04-17,5,"Just like I remember my Granny making it when I was a little girl....yummmy!
Thank you Mrs Stacy, this is absolutely fabulous!"
201091,112871,2005-03-08,5,These meatballs are excellent!  They are even better the second day.
200898,112871,2005-04-20,5,Yummy meatballs. Think I will also try them with cream of mushroom soup. Thanks for posting this great recipe. It's a keeper!
665896,254578,2007-11-25,5,"I cooked this recipe for Thanksgiving and my mother was pleased with the results! Hard to find in stores and rare to even find- if you're able to, so I decided to cook myself. Thanks for sharing! 5 star rating!"
191015,284008,2008-05-08,5,"loved these hearty, tasty baked apples!  Because I made them up ahead of time, I rubbed a bit of extra virgin coconut oil on the inside of each apple before adding the rest of the ingredients so they wouldn't turn brown.  I love walnuts...love apples...this is great!"
727055,284008,2008-09-19,5,"These tasted like apple pie, but were soooo much easier to make! I used some crushed pecans instead of walnuts and I still can't believe how good these were. I think I just found my new recipe for Thanksgiving, how pretty they will be served up on a large platter with roasted nuts! Made this for Fall PAC '08. Thanks for sharing!"
626018,284008,2008-10-13,3,The apples were not done after almost 1.5 hours. I had to add water to the dish I was afraid it would break as the apples were getting burned. The taste was good I don't think I will make this again. Thank you anyway
15521,284008,2009-01-06,5,"Delicious!  I cut the apples in half, then I added whipped cream on top after they were baked.  I love this as a dessert.  The honey ran off a little bit, so I had to scoop it back over the apples.  I might use half the honey before I bake next time, and half after, to keep more honey on the apples."
668240,284008,2010-07-22,5,Great recipe as quick and easy to make with ingredients we have in the cupboard.  Kids really liked the way the honey went like toffee!  Will make again.
47892,251430,2007-11-02,5,"Subbed white balsamic vinegar for dark balsamic. Subbed 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning for the dried basil. Very good! Best prepared at least 1 hour in advance of serving. Thanks for posting your friend's recipe, Impera. CG ;)"
315565,137637,2007-04-28,4,"Fabulous for breakfast or brunch with yoghurt  - I doubled the recipe and used skim milk and dried fruit salad as I had no dates with great success - it is a casserole type thing and I am unsure of the use of the term ""bar"" in the title as it is too soft to cut up and you need to serve it with a big spoon but it is very healthy and I loved it !!"
1283421,137637,2009-08-05,5,"Yummy!
I actually used almond milk (so my vegan friend could have some) and I omitted the coconut.  Super delicious - it's not oatmeal consistency, more like a heavy pudding.  Super yummy and super nutritious!"
593927,137637,2013-07-20,4,"Hearty breakfast not bars. This is softer than bar consistency. DD1 (5 years old) says it is yummy eaten with a dose of organic 3.5% milk on top. I liked it just not as much as her. I used organic wheat free rolled oats, organic pear instead of apple which worked well, organic rasins and organic chopped apricots in a lesser amount, no optional coconut, less organic chopped walnuts instead of almonds per preference, plus the rest of the ingredients. I like that this contains no added sugar. I will try another baked recipe next time."
548963,7397,2007-09-01,4,Ran across this recipe while looking for something to do with ripe bananas that my family didn't eat.  Mixed it up and threw it in the oven as the recipe says and it was awesome!! The neighbors enjoyed it to.  Very Yummy and Very Easy!!!
82616,7397,2004-01-29,5,"This turned out to be a very nice loaf. I realized when I started to make it I did not have enough oil, so substituted a small container of banana yogurt I had on hand. It turned out very nice. Thnks for recipe."
128698,7397,2005-03-18,5,"Very nice cake.  I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.  I've done it twice for 2 different crowds, very easy, fast and tasty."
219672,7397,2005-05-31,5,"I sub'd splenda for the sugar, and WOW, my kids couldn't even tell!!
What a great and simple recipe!!!"
124237,7397,2005-06-24,5,simple but delicious.  Thank you for the recipie
194859,7397,2005-07-22,4,this bread is a fav with my kids...they usually hate toast..but when i made toast out of this bread they ate it all up and asked for more...i am please to say i make this bread in my house once a week but i make 3 loaves of it for the whole week so we can enjoy it!!
344083,7397,2007-04-22,5,"Super moist! I thought it wasn't done at 50 min, but took it out anyway. Turns out that's the perfect amount of time! I couldn't find my great-grandma's recipe but this looked very close to what I remembered. It was only missing the finishing touch- a buttered top dusted with cinnamon sugar. Once I did that it was just like my great-grandma's famous banana bread! Yum!"
230258,7397,2007-11-03,5,"Very good!!
I was looking for a recipe that didn't use margarine cause i was out of it and this worked out perfectly!
Great recipe!"
544876,7397,2007-11-28,5,WOW! this recipe was AMAZING! My family couldn't stop eating it! I usually try different recipies each time I make Banana Bread and this is was by far the best! I will most definately be using this recipe in the future. I also added 1tsp. of honey and it added a nice extra taste!
397272,7397,2008-01-22,5,Most excellent!! Bought a big bag of ripe bananas for a buck and had to use them quick.  This was easy to make and great tasting.  Definately a keeper. Thanks for sharing.
746639,7397,2008-02-19,0,"Super easy! I am not a great baker, but this came out well for me. I only had 2 bananas, so I used those and added 1/2 cup of applesauce for moisture. I also added a little cinnamon."
587978,7397,2008-08-21,5,"Easy recipe and the taste is sooooooo good!  I must admit that I used 5 large banana's instead of the 4 the recipe called for, so the cooking time was off due to more moisutre, but that was all my fault!  Will definately make again!"
922432,7397,2008-09-30,5,"This recipe was really easy to make and it came out delicious.  I ended up adding cinnamon about 1 teaspoon, and it gives it a very nice taste especially if you like cinnamon like I do."
825375,7397,2008-11-05,5,Came out great!
385119,7397,2008-11-11,5,I just made mini muffins (24) and 6 large muffins with this recipe~ I did eat one of the mimi ones while it was still warm and it has a very nice flavor! I recommend this recipe ~ Just wish I had some walnuts on hand would be much better (Since I love nuts in my muffins /brownies.) but over all it gets a 5 star from me! GOD BLESS & Happy Thanksgiving!
773024,7397,2009-07-11,5,"This is the easiest, and best-tasting banana bread I've ever found...it easily adapts to the mini-loaf pans, too, just reducing the time (I cut it back by 10 minutes).  Thanks so much for sharing!"
827900,7397,2009-09-12,0,I love this! It was fabulous as a loaf and muffins! I did change a few things. I used half cup light brown sugar and half cup regular sugar. I doubled the vanilla. I used half olive oil and half applesauce in place of vegetable oil. I am going to also try the recipe with peaches instead of bananas since there are no peach muffin recipees on recipezaar!
176907,7397,2010-06-20,5,"This was a wonderful, fast recipe that hit the spot! I love banana bread, but dislike the complicated recipes that tend to override the banana flavor. This recipe was not only easy and fast, it tasted wonderful! The fully banana flavor came through! The only changes I made were to add chopped nuts and a half teaspoon cinnamon. All of us love it!"
1668664,7397,2010-08-23,5,"YUM!  This is absolutely wonderful!  I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon and walnuts as was previously suggested...perfect.   Next time I will cut the sugar to a half cup as it is a little too sweet.  Nevertheless, this banana bread recipe is the best I've ever tried."
19995,12100,2001-09-27,5,"I made these last night for my roomates. We ate them up so fast. I'm not a real experienced cook, but these where easy to make."
18660,12100,2001-10-06,5,"I have always loved stuffed mushrooms, but afraid to try to make them myself.  This recipe was tasty and easy.  Looks and tastes like a lot of work, but it's not!"
29606,12100,2002-02-08,4,"Simple, yet satisfying.  I made mine with the bacon added and my wife and I were very pleased.  She is insisting that I make more soon.  I found that they cool rather quickly but just a few seconds in the microwave will fix that."
20159,12100,2002-04-20,5,"Very very good.  The stuffing does make more than needed for 24 mushrooms so just buy more mushrooms and use it up!!  (Or eat off the spoon, nice touch.)  I did end up using 1 full cup of milk - used skim and it was fine.  Added it 1/4 cup at a time until reached good consistancy.  The breadcrumbs I had were unseasoned so I added a bit of garlic powder and italian seasonings to it before mixing it all up.  Make sure you chop the stems up really good too - I'd suggest almost mincing them - only cause when you are mixing and trying to melt the cream cheese the stem chunks I kept stirring thinking the chopped stems were cheese."
37229,12100,2002-04-24,4,"They weren't bad, but next time I'd add bacon to it for a little more flavor."
24235,12100,2002-05-13,4,"These were quite good. I followed the recipe exactly using italian seasoned breadcrumbs, almost a full cup of milk and freshly grated parmigiano reggiano. Be sure to use a good parmesan. It makes a huge difference in the flavor."
33588,385053,2009-08-17,5,"Great flavor!! will make often,Thanks."
386585,385053,2009-08-24,5,"This is fantastic!  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden (I seem to have escaped the blight), and it was delicious.  I will be making this again definitely.  Made for Everyday's a Holiday Tag Game."
570804,385053,2009-08-29,5,"What wonderful and easy snack. Will be in my files and used often, especially for entertaining.   Thanks for a recipe with ingredients that are always readily available."
385919,326076,2009-06-08,5,"So yummy!! Great substitute for mayonaisse. I used reduced fat cream cheese, skipped the lemon juice because I didn't have any and it was still great!"
340130,326076,2010-06-13,5,Great stuff ! Made this as a spread for bagels and my guests loved it.
407007,326076,2010-06-13,5,"Fantastic! My mom made this for me when I came to visit, and I instantly got the recipe and made it as soon as I got home as well! :) I used 5 ounces of light cream cheese and garlic powder instead of the cloves. SO good on bagels!"
1803494137,326076,2014-12-12,0,I like to put this on ezekiel sprouted bread with slice of swiss cheese and alfalfa sprouts.
2001635824,326076,2017-07-21,5,I used this in my vegetable pizza recipe as the spread on the croissant crust. Everyone loved it!!!
2001697523,326076,2017-09-02,5,"I have recently gone on Keto and was looking for a simple spread that could multipurpose. This is delicious and blends into anything well. It is very, very rich and find myself satisfied with using a teaspoon at a time. I think my favorite application so far is to put rounded teaspoons of this on top of half a hard boiled egg then add a shake or two of hot sauce. You don't need added salt and the flavor is just delicious."
376189,47629,2014-02-01,3,"These did not turn out great for me. It only made enough for 2 standard pans. They were rather dense and not very flavorful. I&#039;d recommend increasing the spices and possibly sugar depending on the sweetness of your bananas. Baking powder, like someone else mentioned, is probably necessary to improve the density."
54678,47629,2003-04-08,4,"Nice flavor - moist, no need to butter. Used 5 bananas and subbed 1 cup choc chips for the nuts. Did not rise much so was wondering if there should have been some baking powder???"
201040,47629,2005-11-11,5,"Just made it.  I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of bananas and pumpkin.  I substituted white chocolate and butterscotch chips for the nuts.  I also added about a cup of sour cream.  It is so moist, and wonderful.  The double recipe made 2 larges loaves and 4 smaller loaves.  My husband ate an entire smaller loaf by himself before it ever had a chance to cool down.  This is a keeper."
57695,47629,2005-11-16,5,Just took out of the oven! A good dense and moist bread!! i should have added some craisins but didn't think about it at the time. I did up the spices and added vanilla and butter flavorings. Very good. Thanks for posting!
300948,47629,2006-11-30,4,Pumpkin and banana give it a nice flavor. Very moist. Not quite sweet enough though.  I also added more spice than called for (i.e. pumpkin pie spice)
136183,47629,2008-04-12,5,"This is a really excellent banana bread. I used 5 bananas, a small can of pumpkin, LOTS of golden raisins, and about 2 cups of chopped pecans.  The loaves took a bit longer to cook - I set the timer to 50 minutes, then checked them every 5 minutes after that - my metal bread pan finished in 65 minutes, and my glass bread pan took 70 minutes.  The house smelled heavenly!  Thanks for such a wonderful, easy recipe."
402559,47629,2008-11-26,5,"This was really good, very moist. I did use applesauce for the oil. Will make again, thanks for sharing."
1156663,47629,2013-10-10,5,"Delish, delish!  Made mini muffins, baked 12 minutes.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour too.   A new staple for my family."
1800090141,47629,2013-11-22,0,"Awesome!!! I did use applesauce instead of oil. My husband is raving about it as I am typing. Will make this again, might try a pinch of nutmeg next time."
21752,17881,2002-02-12,4,"I made this as part of Worldwide Recipezaar Day on February 10th.  The recipe assumes that you will have roasted garlic, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Not everyone knows how to roast garlic and this could mess up an otherwise delicious appetizer!  Fortunately, I can roast garlic and this was delicious!  We had this with Swedish Rykrisp bread.  Thanks Rise!"
21730,17881,2002-04-07,5,This is an absolutely divine dip! The aroma of the roasted garlic is [i]to die for[/i]! I love it. Thany you Rise for the recipe!
10802,17881,2002-05-25,5,This was delicious with tortilla chips.
2000635610,421812,2015-11-03,1,"After some effort compensating for your instructions, I regret to inform you that your temperature and timing are way off. Please reevaluate this recipe. Also, I recommend including extenuating circumstances regarding its execution (e.g. your kitchen being at high altitude, your oven being next to flowing magma on a volcano)."
463202,183914,2007-04-17,4,"Very quick and easy.  I wouldn't have ordinarily paired marjoram with tomatoes and avocados, but it was very yummy!  I did use shredded mozzarella, because that was what I had on hand."
485728,364119,2009-12-12,5,"This is a delicious twist on a grilled cheese sandwich.  I have been on a grilled cheese kick lately, and I am always looking for new ways to add a bit of variety.  I added a little sprinkling of salt to the avocado, and it came out great.  Thanks."
674022,364119,2010-06-21,5,"Thanks for posting Megan V. You reminded me of two of my favs put together. Thanks too Juli J for the sprinkling of salt idea. I made one with salt and one without ; both were good but the tiny bit of salt brought out the flavor of the avocado so much! Great lunch for my kiddo and I. Simple yes, but a good post. Enjoy! ChefDLH"
527607,364119,2012-01-22,5,These are delicious.  I used some salt too.  Next time a slice of tomato goes on as well!
2002160855,364119,2018-05-22,5,So glad you posted it. I was thinking about putting avocado into a grilled cheese - but just wanted some reassurance that it was a good decision ??
1612088,317060,2011-07-29,4,Made this last fall and it was so perfectly easy!  Will make this one again.
113492,70858,2003-11-19,5,"This is an awesome recipe. I remember my grandmother making it, also. Very easy and taseful. Thanks for the memories. If too much powdered sugar is added I used a little milk to thin it back out. :-)"
97901,70858,2003-09-19,5,I used this on Meow!'s banana oatmeal cake. It turned out very good. I might try using two bananas next time for more banana flavor. It got wows all around. I made it more of a glaze texture.Very good!
152393,70858,2004-10-17,4,"Very good and easy frosting.  I took a hint from Zaney1 and used this on Meow!'s Banana Oatmeal Cake #51264.  It was delicious.  Because I was decorating the cake, I had to use a little more powdered sugar than called for to obtain a frosting consistancy.  I think that next time I too will use extra banana for more flavor.  Thanks JamesDean'sGirl for a great new (old) recipe! "
52543,70858,2004-12-01,5,"An excellent frosting that I used on PaulaG's Apricot Banana Squares! I had no bananas left but, based on other comments, I added a tsp of banana flavouring. Thanx JD's Girl!"
173579,70858,2007-09-21,5,We thought the flavor of this frosting was very good.  It was also very fluffy.  Thanks for posting.
182010,70858,2008-03-24,5,"Delicious!  Fluffy, great texture and, unexpected bonus, it freezes beautifully.  Thanks, Girl!"
993604,70858,2009-09-30,4,A nice flavor.  I used to frost Recipe #152894.  Next time I might try adding some cream cheese to the frosting.  Thank you for the recipe.
1925885,70858,2013-03-09,5,"Yummy!!!  Based on other reviews, I used two smallish bananas that were very, very ripe.  It had an awesome banana flavor, and as other reviewers mentioned, it was quite fluffy - so not a hard type of frosting at all.  I used it to frost Brownies by chef Tweetygrams (my favorite brownie recipe on this site!).  Oh, and I made the recipe as stated, but took half and added cream cheese and a bit more powdered sugar.  WOW!  Both versions were absolute keepers.  Thanks for posting!"
1458294,447040,2011-03-02,4,"So good! I made enough to fill a 11x7x2inch dish, and baked it for 30 minutes. This was roughly<br/>1.5 x the original recipe. I used brown sugar, butter, McIntosh apples and some canola oil on the topping to help it brown. I added the lemon juice and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the apples, which worked well. I should have used firmer apples and left the peel on (forgot to do), so juice sat at the bottom of the pan. Also, it would have been better if the topping stuck together, instead of the just being a sprinkled oat layer. However, it tasted great, so the presentation did not really matter. I served it with some dream whip, because I was out of vanilla ice cream. Next time I will ready the directions carefully and work to perfect the topping. Thanks for the great recipe. I made this for spring PAC 2011."
149363,214798,2007-03-04,5,"Terrific weekend breakfast. We loved the Worcestershire/butter flavour, it went so nicely with the bacon! 200C is 400F for other chef's future reference. It is a great change from bacon and eggs, and I will be making this again! I think some sweet red pepper (capsicum) added to the onions and bacon would be terrific!
Thanks for posting!"
80353,214798,2007-06-01,5,Made up one of these for breakfast today for just me.  Delicious and easy and entirely satisfying.  The worcestershire sauce adds a nice touch.
222478,214798,2007-07-04,5,Great flavour and the cooking method makes the bun wonderfully crisp on the outside but soft on the inside.
286566,214798,2007-11-17,5,"Three of us have just scoffed one of these each for lunch and it was thumbs up all round.  Used jumbo wholemeal rolls (or mini cobs as I call them) and melted the butter and lancanshire relish sauce (didn't have worcestershire) in the microwave, otherwise proceeded as directed.  Thank you Tisme for a keeper.  Made for Edition 2 - Make My Recipe - game of tag."
330545,214798,2009-10-17,5,"Double delicious - the Worcestershire butter adds so much to the taste.  First bite made this a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing, made for Aussie/NZ RS#33."
560491,214798,2011-01-17,5,These are really good and a perfect treat to put in DH's lunch.  I cut each bacon slice in thirds and left out the onions.  The eggs were soft set with a runny yolk just the way we like fried eggs!   Made for AUS/NZ Make My Recipe.
917568,94873,2008-11-22,5,"Holy crap, it WORKED!  I made oven donuts!  And they were GOOD!  I didn't have any normal potatoes so I used sweet potatoes instead, cut the butter back to a half cup and used Splenda instead of sugar.  They still came out absolutely wonderful.  Tender and poofy, but with that crispy donut crust I would never have expected to get on an oven donut.  I am so danged glad I decided to give these a bash.  Thanks for a winner, Chris!  P.S.  Sorry about the picture, my donut cutter is foolishness in physical form.  At least they're vaguely donut-shaped."
110433,94873,2009-01-18,5,"Oh my goodness!  These were really good!  I wish I made a full batch!  I had such a craving for doughnuts today, I'm so glad I found this recipe.  They were easier to make than I expected.  I did mess up a bit and forgot to add the mashed potatoes to the bread machine.  So I kneaded it in after it had finished rising.  The results were good though.  I used a glass and a shot glass to make the hole.  Half a batch made 12 nice size doughnuts, and 20 holes.  I brought these over to the neighbours and they were a big hit.  I definately have to make these again!  I'd like to see how long they last next time.  I dipped half in melted chocolate and the other half in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I personally liked the cinnamon/sugar topping the best."
416191,94873,2009-05-06,5,"Wow! Outstanding, and delicious! The dough is soooo soft and although it takes time to boil the potatoes and roll and cut the dough, it is well worth it. No greasy fried dough! I glazed some of them and did the cinnamon sugar thing with the rest. I made some smaller and some larger ones. Next time I will boil the potatoes the night before and try a different glaze. FYI - The glaze makes them very soft as they are a little firm when you first take them out of the oven, being they are baked, not fried.
    I will be making these little babies a lot. Thankyou for posting this gem Chris!"
1440828,94873,2010-02-26,5,"Yup! These are delicious, soft,fluffy, yet with substance. I made with 1/2 c butter and 1 egg- came out great. I  used two toppings: cinamon sugar and icing glaze (made with whipping cream, vanilla) The entire recipe was gone in one morning with my teenage sons! Thanks Chris"
254614,361524,2009-03-21,5,"Absolutely wonderful! I would like to say that this recipe is wonderful for dialysis patients, if diabetic, use splenda but this is very low on phospherous.I refrigerated for an hour and then covered leftovers and served them tonightt.They were still fresh and the flavor fantastic. There are many recipes using strawberries and vinegars and they are good, but this one is really outstanding. I used huge strawberries and cut them vertically. Thanks for posting."
542060,261461,2010-08-09,5,"A great ice-cream. Very creamy, not too sweet and absolutely delicious!"
201581,359058,2009-07-19,5,"I've never roasted green beans before, but this won't be my last time. These were excellent! Served with Recipe #379195 and Recipe #340851 this was a wonderful combo. Made for Unrated Asian Recipe Tag Game."
171790,359058,2009-07-09,5,Wow! Simply delicious. This is so quick and easy to prepare and packs a big flavour punch. The only change I made to make this was to use Recipe #53039 rather than plain sesame seeds. I'll definitely be making this again. Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag.
653438,359058,2009-07-10,5,This was a great recipe and sooooo easy. I followed instructions except to add a touch of garlic (love garlic) and used toasted sesame seeds (that is what I had. Wonderful! Thank you. Made for Unrated Asian Recipe Tag 2009.
489552,359058,2009-08-16,4,This was pretty straight forward and easy.  It went well with my asian dinner party with family and friends.  Made for Asian Unrated Recipe Tag Game.
37449,359058,2010-03-09,5,I enjoyed the flavor and used gomashio too. Thanks! Made for PRMR game.
15521,359058,2010-06-27,5,Really enjoyed this recipe!  The beans were flavorful and just the right amount of crisp/tender.  Went well with the Asian-inspired flank steak that I served with it.  Thanks!
383346,359058,2011-03-09,5,"I cooked the green beans more than 10 minutes.  It's so yummy with the soy sauce, sesame seeds and sesame oil.  Thanks Bonnette :)  Made for PAC spring 2011"
1775953,359058,2012-12-24,5,"This turned out excellent!  I have a real love of roasted veggies, and I'm glad I found yet another vegetable that works well roasted.  I followed the recipe entirely, except that I added in powdered garlic and I added the soy sauce before the 5 minute baking part rather than after.  Oh, and it ended up taking me 40 minutes to roast the green beans since I doubled the recipe.  Other than that, though, no changes and it was delicious!"
101823,100964,2004-10-09,4,"I first made this using 7-grain toast and swiss cheese and popped it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  I found this to be a bit dry.  Then, I tried it with an herbed cream cheese spread on the toast prior to placing the bacon and tomatoes on top and broiling just a bit.  This was much better.  It is an easy snack that can be adjusted to personal tastes."
401138,100964,2015-06-07,4,"In our family, we reverse the order... bread, cheese, tomatoes, and bacon on top (pre-cook bacon or it will burn when broiling)... then broil (low broil) for 5 or so mins until bacon is crisped and cheese is melting.  We call these &quot;Cheese Dreams&quot; ... technically an open-face broiled sandwich... but it&#039;s been a family extra favorite for 50+ years!"
714046,97005,2008-07-12,5,"really yummy! I used apple-sauce instead of the oil, and sprinkled shredded coconut on top. Big hit!"
93446,97005,2011-08-19,5,We had a wonderful apricot cherry crisp last week when out for dinner and I wanted to find a recipe that was as close as possible.  I like that you can substitute other fruits since the local apricots are not in the stores yet so I had to use peaches instead.  We really loved it and are looking forward to enjoying the leftovers!
263911,53743,2005-11-19,5,"This recipe is very good.  I served it warm, but I'm sure it would be good chilled, too.  The recipe makes a LOT of crumb topping.  I really liked that, but my husband and son scraped most of theirs off, claiming, ""It was too sweet.""  For Thanksgiving, I plan to make this recipe without the topping and crust and using Splenda instead of the sugar to serve as a reduced calorie/carbohydrate dish for the dieters. "
228840,53743,2005-12-06,5,"fabulous, just the way it is!!! this will become a holiday tradition with me. THANKS!"
965609,53743,2008-09-29,0,"There is only one word for this pie. INCREDIBLE! My whole family loved it! I can't wait for Thanksgiving to make it again. Thanks for sharing. 
P.s. the crumb topping is delicious on an apple pie instead of a top crust."
1886454,53743,2012-09-23,5,"I was a bit apprehensive but this recipe blew me away. Absolutely delicious, I will make it again and again!"
254614,277445,2008-02-10,4,"Wow! Delicious! I used the new whole what Ritz crackers and a pint of home canned apricots, not as much butter. I sprinkled cinnamon and allspice. I served with maple nut ice cream! Quick and easy. I am sure that you could add some brandy or whiskey but it is great the way it was submitted.
Thanks for posting."
135887,439078,2010-12-25,4,Great do-ahead recipe.  I added cinnamon.  It took a lot longer to cook than the stated time but it was still good.
29655,354082,2009-04-03,5,What a refreshing beverage!  DD doesn't like coconut so it didn't pass her scrutiny but I thought the flavors were great.  Next time I'll make a batch without the shredded coconut just for her.  Great way to make sure my bananas don't go bad anymore!  Thanks for posting!
432917,261025,2008-01-01,4,these were yummy!  thanks for sharing!
337963,261025,2008-02-05,4,"LOVED THEM!  Lainey, this is going to be added to buffet menu for all future parties!  Quick, easy and so good - you can't beat that!  I used regular baking potatoes rather than red, otherwise made as directed.  Especially loved the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  Thank you for posting!  Made for Photo Tag, please see my rating system.  I promise to raise this to 5 stars as soon as I make again."
770879,279671,2008-02-21,5,"Oh wow!  Just hand me the bowl and a bag of tortilla chips and I'll be in Heaven!  This is great - I served it for a cocktail party.  I wanted something different that would be creamy and flavorful, but more elegant - not like a salsa type.  This was perfect! Thanks."
909116,279671,2009-06-15,5,"GREAT! i added some garlic because i was afraid it would be a little bland, and only had regular pepper so used that instead. but WONDERFUL recipe. lots of compliments! ate it with both crackers AND tortilla chips. Thank so much!"
367711,279671,2009-09-15,4,This was a good dip.  It was nice for a change.  Think next time I'll use 2 avocado's though.  I added a few shakes of garlic powder also.  Served with tortilla chips & avocado rice cakes.
709902,279671,2011-01-16,3,"I used more avocado and less cream cheese.  This was OK, nice and creamy, but really mild.  I don't think I would make it again."
2000187106,279671,2015-05-05,4,"I wanted to make a different guacamole for a change of pace. I used low fat cream cheese,  2 avocados, minced onion, lime juice, garlic powder and a touch of cumin. It was very good!  Will make again."
62545,422978,2010-05-04,5,"This was a staple of my German mother-in-law's kitchen. While the egg mixture and potatoes remained constant, the add-ins varied. She used sausage, left-over beef or pork roast and even an occasional sprinkling of vegetables, especially green pepper or tomatoes. Regardless, we were never disappointed in the resulting meal."
157167,422978,2010-05-20,5,Delicious!  It reminded me of the hash that my MIL makes.  I used sausage instead of bacon as msschar suggested.   I think your servings are very generous - I halved the recipe and it was too much for two people to eat for breakfast.  For ZWT6 N.
58104,422978,2010-05-21,5,Delish!  I made this using 2 russets and 4 eggs. And this was enought to serve 4.  I added fresh chopped chives. Made for ZWT 2010. Thanks for a yummy Breakfast.
416985,422978,2010-05-22,5,"The entire family enjoyed this.  I will make this over & over, with many different additions. Thanks for sharing!! Made for ZWT6."
296809,422978,2010-05-23,5,"I made a 1/2 recipe for ZWT6 & 2 of us still had a *giant* pig-out, so I concur w/other reviewers that the # of servings should be revised to at least 4 ~ which will make the recipe + nutritional data more accurate. I believe the German farmers think as I do. They would make this recipe, add fresh chives if they had them (I did), add diced green pepper if they had it (I did) & then chow-down greedily as we did. Bottom line is we loved this recipe & thx for sharing it w/us. :-)"
305531,422978,2010-05-27,5,"I used 3 small russet potatoes, 4 slices of bacon and then made the rest of the recipe as written. I agree with other reviewers that these are generous portions - but we managed to eat most of it, lol. Simple and tasted great. Thanks Tanner's Mom for sharing. Made by an Unruly Under the Influence for ZWT6."
560491,422978,2010-05-28,5,"I made this with 2 very large russet baking potaotes but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  This is similar to what my mom use to make when we went camping, just used canned potatoes out of convenience.  It was enough for DH and I and leftovers for DH breakfast.  Made for ZWT6 Germany."
65502,422978,2010-05-29,5,"We had breakfast for supper tonight and this was the meal! I used 4 large potatoes, 8 slices of bacon and 8 eggs. We do have leftovers so it will make a nice meal for one of us tomorrow. The four of us enjoyed this a lot with some toast and cold glasses of milk. I actually diced the potatoes first and cooked them in the pan instead of precooking them. Very nice! Made for my fellow No-Nonsense Nibbler for ZWT6. Thanks Tanner's Mom! :)"
621626,422978,2010-05-29,5,This makes a lot. It could have easily fed 3 people. I used canned diced potatoes & I added some shredded cheese while cooking. Made for ZWT6 - No-Nonsense Nibblers.
344231,422978,2010-05-31,5,I enjoyed this for breakfast today as part of the ZWT 6 - Germany - segment.  I didn't have bacon on hand so used some smoked honey ham instead.  It was very yummy and I'd make this again!   I did pre-cook my potatoes in boiling water but otherwise followed the recipe's instructions and it was very easy to throw together. Thanks for posting.  (-:
225853,422978,2010-05-31,5,This is a very tasty recipe.  I also boiled my potatoes and used no bacon (although I did have a bit of bacon grease to fry the potatoes and stirred in some bacon bits just before serving).  My teammate kelllychris made this for the Xtra Hot Dishes during ZWT6 and it sounded too good to pass up.  Thank you for this great recipe.
386585,422978,2010-06-01,4,"We did enjoy this for breakfast, although I found we could have used less potatoes (or more eggs).  I would make this again, adjusting that ratio.  Thanks for sharing this.  Made for ZWT6."
428885,422978,2010-06-24,5,"Oh, this is right on, especially for a farmer! I halved this, and used baby red potatoes sliced in half (just picked from the garden!) and this was heaven on a plate! Made for ZWT 6 2010"
1623265,422978,2010-12-13,5,This is really good. I did as another reviewer suggested and used less potatoes (two). My son felt that he still couldn't taste the eggs. I was happy though.
888081,422978,2011-03-07,4,"Mmm, comfort food after a long drive home. Oops, breakfast is somtimes great for dinner too! Lovely simple flavours, which are often the best.  Added a little Tabasco sauce when eating, just for a little zing!  Made for PAC 2011."
350938,388503,2010-05-07,5,"This was lovely and so easy to make. Had it over baked potatoes :)
Thanks for sharing this recipe."
383346,388503,2011-02-10,5,This is so easy to do. I made it with a sharp orange cheese.  I omitted the salt.  I made macaroni & cheese with it.  Me and my son really liked it.  Thanks AZPARZYCH :)  Made for Photo tag game
675265,388503,2011-03-05,5,Whipped this up in no time flat to have over steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  Simple and delicious!
1806667,388503,2011-05-04,4,"very easy to make, which is a plus. Used extra sharp chedder over steamed broccoli. very versatile sauce. easy to change flavors simply by changing the type of cheese. I will be making this again."
212609,388503,2011-09-29,5,"Amazingly simple to whip up and very tasty....I just loved this, and had to exert amazing self restraint not to just eat it as it was!!!!<br/>I threw this into some pasta, and had myself a delicious mac and cheese....yum!!<br/>Thanks AZ..."
284897,388503,2011-10-10,5,"So easy and simple to make, with such a lovely flavour added with the mustard.<br/>I could see this sauce being served in many ways, we served it with a roast dinner as the family love their cheese sauce over their vegetables, and everyone loved it.<br/>I followed the exact ingredients (except for the salt) in the recipe, but made my sauce in the microwave, and it turned out just perfect.<br/>I will be making this again AZPARZYCH.<br/>Thanks for posting a great cheese sauce recipe."
65502,388503,2011-11-16,5,"This cheese sauce is absolutely delicious! Very creamy, even with skim milk and low fat cheese. I would definitely make this sauce again, making sure to add the Worcestershire sauce and mustard - they added a great flavour to this recipe. Aunt Michel knows how to make a great cheese sauce! We really enjoyed this with baby shell pasta. Made for Zaar Stars tag game. Thanks AZPARZYCH! :)"
50969,388503,2012-09-10,4,"This recipe was made on 9/9/12 to top some broccoli I was severing as a side to go with my steaks.Except for decreasing the Worcestershire sauce by half the recipe was made as written. After tasting the sauce, I did find the texture a bit on the ""grainy "" side. Other than that, the taste was o.k. Thanks for taking the time to post."
275742,102315,2006-05-14,5,This was really easy to make and it tasted great. Thank you.
179133,456859,2014-05-02,5,"Delicious, quick and easy. I used raw sugar and skim milk and reduced to two bananas. Baked for 25 minutes total. Next time, I will use less milk (not quite covering) as they were kinda swimming in it after coming out of the oven. Otherwise loved this. Thanks for sharing! [Made for Spring 2014 PAC]"
231661,30407,2006-11-02,5,"This is absolutely wonderful.  A friend served this at a supper but I didn't realize I would find it here too.  The description is right - it's a perfect combination of a cheesecake and a pie at the same time.  Really, really tasty and good."
126377,174296,2006-07-04,4,"I used this on Fried Tofu #175340, and It made the meal!"
205783,174296,2009-07-02,5,"I made this a couple of weeks ago and have been using it ever since.  I must admit, I only had fresh ginger and was too lazy to grate it, so just chopped a knob of it into 4 bits, gave it a bit of a bash and threw it in the mix.  Maybe at the start you might sacrifice a bit of ginger flavour, but certainly now the flavour is great.  I also bashed the garlic cloves as opposed to mincing/chopping them.  Thanks for the great recipe, made for Aus/Kiwi Recipe Swap June 2009."
481092,174296,2009-07-09,5,Great accompaniment to a variety of foods.  I served with seared ahi tuna.  I tooked the chef's advice and added some chopped Thai chiles.
542159,174296,2009-10-01,4,"A good base sauce. Made as written, although think adding the chili should be listed as a must add. Served over Recipe #224663. Australian/NZ swap #33"
678366,174296,2010-03-27,5,"This is something I'll always keep it in the fridge.The longer it stays the better the taste,the garlic gets stronger. I added some vinegar and turned it into a salad dressing."
486725,398131,2014-06-01,4,"I liked this different take on a popcorn snack. The things I would adjust are the powdered ginger (less than the lower end, it was too strong for me) and the soy sauce (I would add more to try to increase its flavor and even out the distribution across the popcorn). Good flavors!"
59780,71863,2003-10-15,4,Yummy! I used green onion for the onion and mild cheddar. I think next time I will add a bit of cream cheese as well for a firmer spread. This would taste great on baked potatoes too!
13063,8650,2002-07-07,5,"The lemon is a nice addition to the pesto... zingy and bright, this fresh sandwich add-on really 'made' the sandwich (I was having a tomato sandwich).  Great, thank you!"
26278,8650,2002-07-11,5,"Wow! What a burst of flavor!!! Loved this recipe.  It is the first time I have ever grown basil and it sure won't be the last.  Great sauce.  Thanks for posting.
Barb"
20832,8650,2001-10-09,5,"Spicy, zingy, bold, yet full of subtle nuance. Incredibly simple to make, and a little goes a LONG way. I tried it with home grown basil on bowties with some diced sundried tomatos, and YUMMMMM.... Lovely color as well!"
52413,8650,2002-08-16,5,"Tasted pesto only once at the Macaroni Grill and it was so bland I did not order it ever again. A few months ago I started growing a basil plant, now I have 3 and they were taking over the house so I decided to try your pesto. It is so delicious my husband and I could not stop eating it right out of the food processor! I think it's the addition of lemon that gives it the zing. Thanks"
26584,8650,2002-09-20,4,"Wow, I have used this recipe three or four times now, and feel I must check in. 
I put it on a spinach fettuccini, and I will tell you, it is good, hot or cold. Cold on a cold green fettuccini it is a kind of&#8230;you know: hot stuff. It makes a summer lunch special."
55655,8650,2002-10-10,5,"We too ate spoonfuls right out of the food processor! I froze one batch thinking that I would use it in the winter. However, I have already been into it (a week later) and I can say that it freezes and thaws well. We stir-fried some zucchini and red peppers and added the pesto and it was great. Have also used it on pasta with chicken - also great. This pesto is thick enough that you could even put a little bit on a cracker and top with a small shrimp as a colourful addition to an appetizer platter. Thanks Bonnie!"
55690,8650,2002-10-12,5,"First time I have made my own pesto and it came out great!  Spread it on slices of french bread, topped with sliced roma's and mozzeralla cheese and popped under the broiler.  My husband said I can make this every night for him.  "
75902,8650,2004-02-11,5,Yummy!!  I love the lemon ... gives it an extra boost whilst helping to keep the fat content down.  I also did a batch with coriander and that was delicious too.
15892,8650,2004-02-11,5,"I love how garlicky and light this is!  I've made this twice and it freezes/thaws so well, good mixed with a tablespoon of mayo on chips or crackers, and this last time I threw in equal parts basil and parsley.  This is a keeper, Bonnie, and I'll always have some of this on hand.  "
148068,8650,2004-06-27,5,"This is just how I make it!  Saves me posting my version!  BRAVO!
PS:  you can also spoon this on top of chicken breasts and bake.  Serve over a bed of hot linguini! "
149043,8650,2004-07-04,5,A friend gave me fresh basil from her garden.  Turned it into you pesto and am so glad!  Used it tonight on Nurse Di's Pesto Ravioli with Chicken recipe.  Scrumptious and super simple meal.  Thank you.
40211,8650,2004-11-14,5,"This is very flavourful and delicious. I froze it into ice-cube trays, then transferred them to a ziploc bag for storage. It's really good on homemade pizza (along with or replacing the tomato paste). "
57500,8650,2005-01-25,5,mmmmmmmm... this pesto got my husband and me so addicted. it just doesn't last around here-no matter how much i make. thanks for sharing!
205783,8650,2005-07-03,5,"Loved this pesto - since I'm trying to watch how many calories I eat I tried this as it is a bit lower in fat.  I was a bit sceptical, however the taste is fantastic - the recipe still have heaps of flavour.  I served this over steamed chicken, and also with some stirred through cooked pasta.  It was delish, and thanks very much for the recipe.  "
67026,8650,2005-07-16,5,great baisc pesto recipe.  thanks!
149002,8650,2005-08-14,5,I used this to roast red potatoes...Wow!  I added more garlic because it is to my taste.  The lemon added a zing!  Thank you.  This will be one of my favorites as long as the fresh basil lasts.
243749,8650,2005-09-17,5,"I thought I posted this once but will try again. 
This stuff is excellent! Very robust flavor, and easy to make! KUDOS!"
148316,8650,2005-09-18,5,"This turned out wonderfully!  For this recipe I harvested our precious Opal Basil from the herb garden.  I used 5 cloves of garlic, freshly grated Parmesan cheese and the juice of one lemon.  Using a silicone mini muffin mold, I placed roughly 1 tablespoon of pesto in each mold for freezing - this equaled 12 perfect pesto ice cubes - enough to last us for most of the winter.  Great recipe - absolutely delicious!  Thanks for posting :)"
160974,8650,2005-09-20,4,"I love the idea of having pesto in the freezer. It really livens up dishes and so better than purchased. Mine turned out thicker than I liked (next time I'm going to try adding some chicken broth to it) and too garlicky (my fault!), since I added the 5 cloves of garlic(which did overpower the lemon juice. I just put some in a buttermilk dressing today and it gave it a special flavor and used it in a pasta dish with chicken and peppers (everyone loved it) so I am having fun with it. 

Roxygirl"
140275,8650,2005-10-01,5,"This is really good. I have made this several times already this summer and am ready to make a bunch for freezing.
The only thing I changed was that I added the grated lemon zest from the lemon I juiced. I also roasted the nuts in a dry pan.
One suggestion for freezing though. You might want to hold off on the addition of the cheese until you thaw it for use, as the cheese will have a better taste and texture if added fresh.
Lemon in basil pesto is simply a no brainer. Nothing could be better!"
208631,8650,2005-12-06,5,"Made this up today with the last of the fresh basil outside. In California of course where frosts are just barely beginning! 
Used sweet lime (lime that's turned yellow) and lemon juice mix from the trees outside, with some zest.
Came out a bit thin, but to each their own. Tasty and freezes nicely in ice cube trays. Might think to add some cilantro or mint to it next time to play a little."
191990,8650,2006-06-16,5,I used Tofu instead of parmesan cheese. (My mom is very sensitive to a lot of foods) It was WONDERFUL!!  I will be making this again...it deserves 10 stars! :)
242809,8650,2006-07-06,5,"THis is the best pesto I have tasted yet! The addition of lemon is fabulous and brightens up the pesto. With this pesto, I made a fantastic sandwich: Ciabatta, pesto, brie, and seasoned roasted chicken breast. The combination is a killer sandwich!! Thanks for posting!!"
72254,8650,2006-07-06,5,"This was the first time to ever eat pesto, but I'm sure you've heard this before.  This was really delicious.  Served this with bow tie pasta  and tossed in some diced tomato.
This would be really good on some toasted french bread too.
Very easy to make. Very summery and bright tasting which at the same time packing a garlicy punch.  I did add some salt to it to round off the flavour. Definatly a keeper and what a good idea to freeze this because I've got lots of fresh basil in the garden and now I know what to with it. lol
Thanks for a delicious recipe."
148114,8650,2006-07-09,5,"I was looking for something to do with all of the basil in the garden and this fit the bill wonderfully. It has a greaty tangy flavor, I'm looking forward to adding it to chicken and pasta tonight."
119549,8650,2006-07-17,5,"I made this last night and my husband said, ""that left my tongue happy""... Well, I've never heard that during the last 10 years, so here are your stars!!! :)  I used basil from the garden and it was excellent.  Thanks"
145731,8650,2006-09-04,5,So fresh and delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly but did a much rougher process than what the picture looks like and am absolutely loving this pesto. It's so good that I've just been eating it with tortilla chips. Thanks for sharing!!
54678,8650,2006-09-13,5,The frost hit my basil patch early and I was worried about the dark leaves but the flavour was still there. Loved the addition of the lemon juice. I used grated romano cheese and my yield after doubling the recipe was 12 ice cube sized portions for the freezer.
126037,8650,2006-09-15,5,"This is a good basil pesto, but watch the lemon - it can overpower the flavor; next time I will cut back slightly.  I threw the pesto on spinach fetticini, tossed in a tomato and chopped chicken breasts, then topped it with toasted pine nuts and fresh basil.  It was excellent and easy!  I froze the extra pesto for later use."
453338,8650,2007-02-21,4,1/2 the lemon - also has a bite so don't overdue the garlic.
60918,8650,2007-06-22,5,"Had everything for this recipe except the pine nuts, but I did have just about the right amount of macadamia nuts left from anoter recipe.  In went the macadamias, and out came excellent lemon macadamia pesto.  This is definitely going into my recipe list, although I will likely double the recipe next time since I have a feeling the amount I made is going to be gone very fast."
230404,8650,2007-06-27,5,"Excellent Flavor and easy and fast to make.  Especially considering the basil comes from my son's herb garden.  I use this over pasta, in wraps, everywhere I can.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
502468,8650,2007-07-14,4,Really great full fresh flavour.  I used sliced almonds (they grind down easier)when I ran out of pine nuts and it still tasted fabulous!
509259,8650,2007-07-20,5,It is the best pesto I have ever made and I have been making it for many years I can't believe how simple it was to make. The lemon juice is the key to the wonderful flavor. I froze it in 1 Tblsp. portions and got 13 portions.I spread some on crackers and topped it with a grape tomato for a quick canape.
209603,8650,2007-07-30,4,i've never made pesto before so this was fun. i used an immersion blender and it had a bit of a hard time with the dry ingredients so i added a spoon or two of plain yogurt. it was good. the finished product was a little thick for me even after adding a bit of water... maaybe i'll add more. but it was a good basilly flavor and seemed to go over well. i also used thai basil.. thanks for a good first time.!
240668,8650,2007-08-01,5,"I had a surplus of basil in the garden and decided to try using some of it up with this recipe.  Wow!  ""Too much fresh basil,"" is never going to be a problem for me.  I subbed almonds for the pine nuts and used Romano cheese.  I ate the pesto with fresh slices of tomato on wheat crackers.  Yum."
298979,8650,2007-08-01,5,"Excelllent recipe!! I did use walnuts instead of the pine nuts but it was still great. 
I made the Chicken pesto recipe from Recipezaar today and used this instead of the packaged pesto. Thanks Bonnie."
78365,8650,2007-08-06,3,I'm not much of a Pesto fan but I liked this one.  I screwed up and for got the Parmesan.  I was able to added the the plate before eating.  The wife liked it so I'm sure we'll make it again.
387626,8650,2007-08-09,5,made this heaps of times and to order! i always make about 5 batches because everybody pinches it out of my freezer! i do use picorino cheese instead of parmesan. thanks for posting the receipe.
45999,8650,2007-08-09,4,I'm not a great pesto fan but this is pretty good.  I used 5 cloves of garlic and next time I will just use 3.
559090,8650,2007-08-12,5,This was wonderful - my husband went back for thirds.
464797,8650,2007-08-17,4,"Very zesty pesto.  I served it over pasta, although I could picture using it with lots of other dishes and foods.  I would try this again with some chopped sundried tomatoes, on a sandwich, or even as part of a meat dish.  Thanks for the recipe. =)"
141610,8650,2007-09-04,4,"Great recipe. I weeded my garden and it was all basil and this recipe fit the bill.  I had everything pretty much in the pantry.  I exchanged pine nuts for slivered almonds, doubled the cheese, and used the juice of a fresh lemon and just added an equal amount of olive oil.  Then served it over rotini pasta with olives and diced tomatoe for dinner last night.  The kids loved it and so did my hubby.  The rest I tossed into some ground turkey and put in the crock for a meat loaf so it will be part of tonights dinner too.  Very versitile."
199971,8650,2007-09-26,5,"I made this last night with the rest of the basil in my garden.  I used about 4 cups of basil and left the rest of the ingredients the same...I used 5 garlic cloves as one can never have enough garlic.  It was AWESOME!!!!  I have never had pesto before (I don't like Italian food), but this was absolutely incredible!  I spread some on half a bagel and it was the best thing I have EVER had."
400991,8650,2007-10-30,5,"This was sooo good. I used it for pesto ""fried"" chicken #55836.  It was really easy and great tasting. I will use this for all of my pesto recipes."
177933,8650,2007-11-02,5,"Wonderful Pesto, I added a little more lemon juice and some salt.  I made this to go in Recipe #126611 and it was delish!  Thanks!"
146904,8650,2007-11-08,4,ummm!! I used this pesto recipe for my roasted vegies pasta salad and it was great!! I used 3 1/2 cloves garlic and was a bit too strong for me (and I'm a huge fun of garlic!) so I might use only 1-2 cloves next time. but will definetely make this again thanks for posting the recipe!
94105,8650,2007-12-15,5,"I made this and used it for the zaar pesto chicken recipe (highest rated ""pesto"" recipe of date)  This was so good, I can't wait until summer, I will have to plant extra basil plants yummmmm!"
655529,8650,2008-01-09,4,I made this pesto to give as gifts for Christmas in decorative jars. Would go so well with pasta. Unfortunately I didn't keep any for myself so I will be making it again! Easy to make.
629920,8650,2008-01-20,4,"This is soooo good, and you can whip up a batch in just few minutes.I substitute nutritional yeast flakes for the parm to make it vegan. So far  I've only used it on spaghetti and bow tie pasta, which was great. Thanks for posting."
239758,8650,2008-02-12,5,A fantastic pesto recipe. I have made this three times in two weeks -- using 4-5 cloves of garlic depending on the size of the cloves. It freezes beautifully. I pack the basil leaves tightly and have found that the 1 1/2 cups weighs 90 grams (or 3 ounces). Thanks for a real winner.
115758,8650,2008-03-09,5,"Oh my...a fantastic light and refreshing tasting pesto. I couldn't help myself and ate some directly from the blender, spread over some nice fresh woodoven bread. The rest is in the freezer waiting to be eaten over pasta along with some sun dried tomatoes and toasted pine nuts, later this week.
Thanks for sharing."
388044,8650,2008-04-07,5,"So easy to make, and delicious."
295591,8650,2008-04-08,5,Wowzers!  Turned out fantastic :).  I was a little worried because i used parsley instead of basil but still came out perfect
580295,8650,2008-05-18,3,"In comparision to everyone else, mine did not come out that good. I made it twice just to make sure. I guess I'll keep buying the jarred stuff at the store."
871112,8650,2008-07-01,3,"I made 3 separate batches, and only on the last batch did I get it to taste somewhat right.  Way to much garlic, first I tried 6 cloves, then 4, then 2.  I think I had too much basil in first batch, (packed it too tightly).  Mine tasted very ""grassy"" and on the bitter side?"
585211,8650,2008-07-02,5,My DH does not like pesto but he LOVES this recipe.... and so do I!  I make one change- I replaced the pine nuts with walnuts.  Very yummy!  thanks for posting
332564,8650,2008-07-05,5,"This is a delicious recipe and has become my standby pesto. I love that it uses less oil than most pesto recipes, yet it has great flavor.  Today I toasted some whole grain bread, spread it with a generous layer of pesto and then topped with homegrown tomato slices and arugula.  Yum!  A simple summer sandwich."
165169,8650,2008-07-12,4,"This was really good.  I didn't have a food processer, so I used my blender but needed the liquid to help blend, so I went ahead and put everything in all at once.  It turned out great!!!"
269656,8650,2008-07-16,5,Outstanding recipe! This was my first time making pesto and this recipe was super easy and very very tasty! Thank you!@
185139,8650,2008-07-28,4,"Made this pesto last night since the basil in my garden is growing like a weed.  I had to add extra oil because I made it with the blender.  I enjoyed the lemony flavor, though next time I might use just a bit less.  We enjoyed this over spaghetti (with a lot more parmesan cheese on top) and it was a delightful, delicious and easy meai.  Glad to have a new pesto recipe!

Thanks!"
80219,8650,2008-07-31,5,Excellent.  I used walnuts.  Two cloves garlic -- plenty.  Tossed with linguine and topped with a bit more fresh parmesan.  Super easy and tasty!
206616,8650,2008-08-06,5,"Very easy to make, and very flavorful. I think this recipe made about 1/2 cup pesto.  I usually mix 1 part of pesto to about 1 or 1 1/2 parts mayo (pesto-mayo, as it's called in CA) and use it as spread on sandwiches. Use french, sourdough, ciabatta, or similar type deli bread, sliced in half, and scoop out a bit of the middle so there's not too much bulk. Spread the pesto-mayo on the cut side of both pieces of the bread, then layer with fresh spinach leaves (on the bottom), then smoked turkey slices, then mozzarella or provolone cheese slices. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and pepper to taste, replace upper piece of bread and wrap sandwiche(s) in foil. Warm for 15-20 minutes in a 300-350 degree oven. Before serving, open up warmed sandwiches and add sliced tomatoes and avacados, if desired.  I've had it with artichokes as well."
59307,8650,2008-08-22,5,"Very tasty, I used 3 garlic cloves and that was enough.  I also added a little salt.  Thanks for posting, I never will have to buy store made pesto again!"
57850,8650,2008-09-01,5,"AWESOME recipe! I used about 1 tablespoon of garlic powder instead of garlic, walnuts instead of pine nuts, and some red wine vinegar for the lemon juice, and it still turned out great. thanks so much!"
310749,8650,2008-09-04,5,"My first try at Pesto and it's great!  Really, what can I say other than it's super easy and very tasty!  It's better the day after making it.  I let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours to let the flavors blend together before using.  Thanks for posting!"
320870,8650,2008-09-05,5,Loved the lemony flavor to this pesto.  Made as directed except I used extra garlic.  Will be making again soon.  Served over pan fried tilapia...YUM!
451574,8650,2008-09-08,3,"Very easy to make, but not the best."
356986,8650,2008-09-26,5,"I really liked the freshness that the lemon juice added to this. My husband, for some reason, just can't stand lemon added to food. Well, too bad, because I love it, and when Momma's happy, the whole house is happy! Pasta was the first, obvious option, but as Just Call Me Martha said, on a cracker with a shrimp on top would be wonderful for an appetizer. Love that one! I'll keep making batches as long as my Basil keeps producing. Thanks for a great, simple recipe!"
377581,8650,2008-10-06,3,"I tried 4 cloves garlic. Very easy to make, and nice but not the best. I plan to use the leftovers in a cold pasta salad. Thank you for posting."
1161295,8650,2009-02-21,5,"So yummy!!! I didn't have pine nuts, so I used walnuts instead and a little more olive oil. Very good recipe. Thank you"
729254,8650,2009-04-14,5,Simply Awesome! Thanks.
916394,8650,2009-05-10,5,easy and delicious. thanks!
1015482,8650,2009-05-25,5,"Never had pesto before, so I don't know how it compares, but this was pretty good! I used it to make Stuffed Pesto Chicken."
574445,8650,2009-06-06,5,I used up a surplus of basil that I have growing to make this. I put it in Recipe #126611 and it is delicious! I can't stop picking at it. Yum!
55578,8650,2009-06-18,0,Not sure yet.  I've made it and DS (who loves pesto) felt it had too much lemon in it.  I'll wait a day or so with in the fridge and maybe it will taste a bit different.
1151826,8650,2009-06-23,5,My husband and I loved this recipe. It was light and lemony and nothing in it was cooked except the pasta. Great for summer evenings!
464080,8650,2009-06-30,5,"Awesome!  I used the full 5 garlic cloves, asiago cheese, just 2 squeezes of lemon juice (who knows how much that it), 1/8 cup olive oil and 1/8 cup vegetable oil.  Perfect!  THANKS!"
130219,8650,2009-07-02,5,"(First post 8-27-08) 5 stars for easy preparation and WONDERFUL flavor! Great way to use fresh basil from the garden. Thanks Bonnie this one is a keeper for me.

Update 7-03-09 
Made this today and mixed equal parts of pesto with cottage cheese (lowfat) for a delicious spread. This recipe is SO good it's worth growing your own basil and lots of it!"
719083,8650,2009-07-10,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe and was able to pluck enough basil from my garden to satisfy 1.5 times the amount. I found that even 3 garlic cloves was a lot. What I've decided for the future to make sure that the shells are completely taken off is to stick the garlic cloves in first and then pulse for a few seconds and pull out any shells that come loose. Mine didn't turn out quite as thick or green as some of the pics but was still very good although it wasn't enough pesto for a meal for a family of 5. So we've slowly been eating it with crackers. Thanks for the delicious pesto!
UPDATE 7/10: Made this today with both sweet bail and a purple basil. This is a great combination as it gives it some lovely color."
976956,8650,2009-07-17,5,"I used 3 cloves of garlic and walnuts as I didn't have any pine nuts. It was great! We made a pesto, tomato and broccoli pizza with it. It was fantastic! Thanks!"
470351,8650,2009-07-23,5,"I give this one 5 stars for the basic concept and the ""punch"" it gives to basic pesto.  However, I do feel there's WAY too much lemon in this!  I made this pesto because I needed pesto in a recipe and the lemon was very overwhelming when I first tasted the pesto.  To offset this, I increased the pine nuts, EVOO, parmesan and basil to make more of the pesto to dilute the lemon.  PERFECT!  When I make this again (and I will since it's far more flavorful than normal pesto) I will cut the lemon juice ratio either in half or possibly even in 1/3.  Thanks for posting.  GREAT flavor!"
1334630,8650,2009-07-25,5,"Great stuff, we love this recipe"
908620,8650,2009-08-01,5,I have used this wonderful recipe several times and love it!  I have also frozen several batches for this winter when my basil is not as plentiful.  Thank you so much for a great easy recipe!
748565,8650,2009-08-06,5,"Um this was incredibly AMAZING!! This was the first time I've ever made pesto and I can't believe what I've been missing out on this whole time! My husband gave this a 5 (& that is very rare). Wonderful recipe, can't wait to make again!"
500860,8650,2009-08-12,4,"it was really very good, and I ended up using about a tablespoon in a whole bowl of pasta and adding cheese, oil and lemon juice. I'm freezing the rest. It just seemed like it was missing something....something that would have lended to it's mix or spread ability...? But I don't know what. Either way, it was very good. Thank you."
696808,8650,2009-08-18,5,"This was fresh and delicious, I had tons of basil that I didn't know what to do with.  Now I have a freezer full of yummy pesto for the winter.  I followed the recipe using a little more garlic than called for.  I will grow more basil just so I can make more."
985795,8650,2009-08-19,5,"I used this pesto layered with thinly sliced tomatoes, sliced black olives and Feta cheese on homemade pizza dough.  Excellent!"
607150,8650,2009-08-26,5,"This is super yummy delicious!  I used the full 5 cloves of garlic and it just has a wonderful, full taste.  Will be keeping this one in the front of the book!"
694465,8650,2009-09-11,5,"OMG!!  This recipe has the OMG factor for sure!  This recipe is delicious and thank you for sharing! FYI, I added a touch of sea salt and that made it a little better (if that is even possible!)"
1364914,8650,2009-09-16,4,"Really great pesto, I used 3 large, organic garlic and a touch more lemon juice and voila! It was fabulous and froze well too."
539686,8650,2009-10-31,5,"Fantastic Pesto! We loved it as a pizza topping, but would be equally great on pasta or even as a dip!"
545825,8650,2009-11-02,2,I didn't really like the flavor of this.  I wonder if the basil I planted was a different variety or something.  The flavor was just very off.
121613,8650,2009-12-01,4,"This is how I make pesto, without adding the lemon juice.  Also, I lightly brown the pine nuts in a pan w/ some olive oil before adding to the food processor.  

To use this sauce, I add some heavy cream or half and half to the pesto and heat through in a pan, and then top my pasta with it."
278516,8650,2009-12-17,5,"Hooray! 50 reviews!! :D
I love the lemon in this pesto.
Made with fresh-picked basil from our garden (& lemon from the neighbour's tree!).
We made a lasagna & garlic bread & when the garlic bread was done we spread pesto on the slices as we ate it.
Beautiful.
UPDATE: This has become our go-to pesto recipe. That's gotta deserve bumping our original 4* review to 5! :)
Thanks for sharing, Bonnie."
1108825,8650,2009-12-26,5,Great! I substituted cashews for the pine nuts and it came out perfect! I will be making this again for sure. I used the pesto to top off mushroom and spinach ravioli. Delish!
373495,8650,2010-01-13,5,"I used this in Recipe #73341, it was perfect.  I did scale it down because I didn't have that much fresh basil, so I sort of eyeballed the other ingredients, but everything came out perfect!  Yum!"
126440,8650,2010-04-10,5,Wonderful!  I used this on Recipe #397202.  Loved it.
1122988,8650,2010-05-24,5,This was really yummy.  I used toasted walnuts instead of pine nuts.  I could eat this all day!
133174,8650,2010-05-29,5,After 100+ reviews not much is left to be said.  My basil needed to be trimmed and what better than to make pesto.  I washed the basil leaves then gave them a quick spin in the salad spinner.  The basil through cheese was placed in the Vita-Mix and the lemon juice/oil combination drizzled in.  In time delicious pesto.  I put it in freezer containers and froze it for later use but not before tasting.  The lemon juice really helps to liven up the flavors.
413880,8650,2010-06-08,5,"We all loved it!!  I am going to have to buy more basil plants to feed my habit:) I did use walnuts just because the pine nuts were so expensive at the store and added a pinch of sea salt.  I spread it on french bread, layered roma tomatoes, and mozzarella and popped it under the broiler as suggested by deb k.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe."
837451,8650,2010-06-21,5,Perfect pesto! I used toasted walnuts in place of the pine nuts. Froze pesto in ice cube trays for future use! Thank you!
317596,8650,2010-06-24,5,"4.5 stars!

I have to say I'm a big fan of the lemon juice in this recipe! I also liked how it used half the amount of olive oil that other recipes asked for. I was a bit nervous this would be dry but it actually came out really great and creamy. It tasted amazing when I tasted it for seasoning. I added a tiny bit more lemon juice. However, once I added this to pasta, the flavor immediately died and tasted quite bland. I added a bunch of salt and pepper but it was still bland. Strange because it was so flavorful  beforehand. I'd def. use this as a dip or added to a cold pasta salad.  The lemon juice is just the best part of this recipe as it keeps the basil so bright and green!"
924109,8650,2010-07-03,5,Awesome. My first homemade pesto - soooo easy and soooo tasty. Didn't know what to do with the big bunch of basil I got from our CSA this week and made this and stir fried some of the other veggies and shrimp and tossed it all with some pasta. Terrific. Thank you. I did just use the juice from 1 whole lemon so might have been about double the amount and then I lessened the olive oil just a bit.
385999,8650,2010-07-04,5,"I made this today so we could serve it over some low carb Dreamfield's Pasta.  I love the taste of this, it's yummy.  I used Romano cheese in mine because the zing it has better then Parmesan.  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe."
540142,8650,2010-07-21,5,"wonderful, love the lemon!"
1061209,8650,2010-07-25,4,Very light and refreshing pesto. Although the lemon flavor was a little overpowering for me. Might decrease the amount just a smidge next time I make.
891130,8650,2010-08-18,4,"Wow, this pesto blew my tastebuds off! A tiny dab'll do ya. The flavor improved, I believe, after a night in the fridge so it had a chance to meld. After reading the other reviews I got daring and used slivered almonds in the place of pricey pine nuts because I had some on hand. I don't think it really detracted from the overall flavor."
10404,8650,2010-08-18,5,"Very Nice Pesto!  I used 2 cups of basil leaves, upped the oil to 1/4 cup, added 1 teaspoon salt  and used roasted sunflower seeds over the pine nuts.  Great color, love the lemon bite and will be using this recipe all summer as I have 4 basil plants that are over 2 and a half feet tall.  Thanks for posting, Di ;-)"
1133190,8650,2010-09-03,4,I should preface this by saying I've never made homemade pesto before so I don't have anything but store bought to compare it to.  I thought it was good but I really felt it needed salt and maybe a little pepper.  Once I added both the flavor improved significantly.  I also used about half the lemon juice called for.  I just put everything in the food processor (should have read the directions more carefully beforehand) but it worked out great. Thanks!
858501,8650,2010-09-17,5,Super easy and really palatable.  I didn't have pine nuts so I used some walnuts.  Still tasted great.  Very bold and zingy flavor!
1376400,8650,2011-03-06,5,Awesome recipe. I halved the recipe and used 4 oz pre-crushed basil in a tube. I also omitted pine nuts. I substituted lemon juice with lime juice. Tasted great in pasta!
231057,8650,2011-04-10,5,This is a wonderful pesto recipe.  I have used it several times and it is definitely in my favorite file.  Love the flavor and it was so easy to make.  Thanks very much for posting.
744425,8650,2011-06-07,5,"Mmm... delicious!  I've avoided pesto so this was a first for me, and the flavour is amazing.  I haven't tasted it on pasta yet; it's sitting in the fridge to develop flavour for a day first, so I'll come back to let you know how it was!"
128803,8650,2011-09-06,5,This pesto was delicious!  I made enough to freeze as well.  We'll be able to enjoy that summer taste all winter.  Thanks for posting!
1072593,8650,2011-09-16,5,I was wondering if Italians have garlic problems.  Maybe we could harness that power for good.
31807,8650,2012-04-05,4,"Delicious! 4 cups basil, 8 garlic cloves, zest of half a lemon, juice of 1 1/2 lemons, 3/4 c pine nuts, 1 c grated parmesan and about 1/3 cup really fruity olive oil. It did need a good one-and-a-half or two teaspoons of kosher salt. Spooned into ice cube trays (at least the part we didn't eat right out of the processor, smeared on bread) and frozen until hard, then transferred to a vacuum-seal bag for longer storage."
745531,8650,2012-07-07,5,This recipe was awesome...  thank you for sharing
232037,8650,2012-07-29,5,"Solid recipe. Nothing overwhelming, just a good and honest recipe. I've already used it on pizza, corn on the cob, pasta, chicken, and I froze a lot of later use (I made a double batch from a huge basil haul from my CSA). I was a bit shocked at the price of pine nuts. I think I'll try an alternative next time."
199020,8650,2012-08-13,5,"I had an abundance of basil in my garden this year. Unfortunately, it was the only herb that did any good this summer. I had no idea what to do with all of it, and one of my coworkers suggested making pesto. I've always liked pesto, but I didn't even know what was in it! This is delicious! So quick and easy to make! And cheap, too! I may try the walnut version next time. The pine nuts were expensive and hard to find. Thanks!"
146976,8650,2012-09-02,0,"Wow, what flavour!  I doubled the recipe, used 8 garlic cloves (we love garlic!) and made it as stated.  I will use this on the Pesto-Chicken Italiano tonight, and freeze the rest.  I have LOTS of basil in my garden this year, so I will for sure be making this recipe again for the long winters in Wisconsin,  Thanks Bonnie for the recipe."
970861,8650,2013-06-29,5,"First time making basil pesto, and it was delicious!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used a combination of red (correct term?) and green leaf basil, used almonds instead of pine nuts, and left out the parmesan cheese (lactose intolerant). It was so good!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixed with spaghetti, served with pan-fried shrimp."
2935688,8650,2013-08-08,5,This was a great  pesto! Love it over grilled chicken and pasta. Will make this again for sure!
103876,8650,2013-09-03,5,Wow! This is amazing. I have never made pesto before and this turned out perfect. I used pecans instead of pinenuts and 1 1/2 T of lemon juice.  I am going to increase my basil planting so we can have this more often.   Thanks for posting!
364211,8650,2014-05-14,0,"Made this after pruning back my patio basil plant.  I have not experienced pesto before so I can&#039;t compare.  After processing this, it tasted rather raw.  I put it in a bowl and placed clear plastic wrap, expelling all air, on top of bowl and pesto.  I did add some Italian parsley, to make up for a small deficit of available basil.  The nuts were omitted because I had none on hand.  Used bottled lemon juice and added a pinch of salt. Thanks for posting, Bonnie Traynor."
355531,8650,2014-07-05,5,"When my basil plant started threatening to take over it&#039;s pot in the back yard I went looking for a pesto recipe and landed on this one due to all the positive ratings.&lt;br/&gt;Really easy to make and holy cow, so delicious!&lt;br/&gt;I decided to cook up some bow ties just to try it out and have the left overs later. Ya, that didn&#039;t happen, ate the entire pot of bowties!  I couldn&#039;t stop myself.&lt;br/&gt;I put 4 huge garlic cloves in this so of course now I am burping garlic all over the place! LOL&lt;br/&gt;This is such a delicious and simple recipe and I can&#039;t wait to eat more!!"
1584953,8650,2014-07-21,4,"Nice basic recipe.  I subbed walnuts for the pine nuts and omitted the lemon. I can always add some upon serving, if I choose. FYI,  when I freeze this, I omit the parmesan cheese. It doesn&#039;t freeze well and can also be added just before serving. I freeze it in a &#039;mini muffin tray&#039;, rather than in ice cube trays. I give the muffin tray a spritz with spray oil for easy removal, and then place the little frozen pesto &#039;muffins&#039; in zip lock bags."
2368155,8650,2014-08-04,5,"I used walnuts instead of pine nuts.  It was awesome.  Used it to make tuna salad, on tomatoes, and in soup so far."
53932,8650,2014-08-10,4,A good way to use the abundance of basil in my garden!  I used 4 cloves of garlic and added a tablespoon or so more olive oil as well as a sprinkling of salt.
368078,8650,2014-08-27,5,"Made just as directed, except used slightly less lemon (a splash, instead of 1/8 C), and a little more olive oil (to the desired consistency) as I didn&#039;t want too much lemon flavor.  It was perfect, and I think we&#039;ve found our go-to basil pesto recipe! :)"
906665,8650,2014-09-10,4,I liked the lemon flavour of this. It also used a lot less oil than other recipes. Tasted great with pasta!
1800292167,8650,2014-10-24,5,This is a really good recipe.  The only thing I did differently was add a dash of salt and I think that really made the flavors pop. I will use it for my pizza again!
140132,8650,2014-11-08,5,"I had a bunch of basil from my garden, so I buzzed this up and froze them in ice cube trays for future use.  Tastes great."
628279,8650,2015-01-20,5,"Fantastic!  Lovely zing (but I love garlic), simple, quick and delicious!  I&#039;d tried another one that used a couple tablespoons of pine nuts but if you&#039;ve got &#039;em, bring &#039;em on and sprinkle some on top when you&#039;re done!  This made a very nice pesto pasta, I tossed some of the pesto with pasta, put about a tablespoon on top and sprinkled that with whole pine nuts.  A couple basil leaves for garnish makes a nice presentation. Thank you for the recipe~"
1900301,8650,2015-02-21,5,"I substituted walnuts for pine nuts.  Freezes well.  This recipe has inspired me to triple our basil crop next season.  I&#039;ve added a photo of our favorite way to eat it.  My kids say it&#039;s perfect - baked Italian loaf, pesto, sliced roma tomatoes and mozzarella."
2000443191,8650,2015-08-31,5,"I am a pesto addict. I have been making my own at home for a while now. It goes great on just about anything. This recipe is spot on. This is the first time I have used lemon juice in my pesto and it was wonderful. I think the lemon will help the pesto keep its vibrant green color. I made it tonight and used it as a spread for delicious open faced mozzarella and tomato sandwiches. I doubled the recipe and froze the majority of the pesto in a container filled to the top and sealed. It will be used later to make a creamy pesto pasta. Just a suggestion for anyone wanting to switch things up, adding a medium chopped tomato to your pesto creates a lovely variation on a traditional pesto. This makes a delicious base for creamy penne pastas with sundried tomatoes!"
632249,8650,2016-09-16,5,"Really good pesto. This was my first time making pesto and the family loved it. I used walnuts in place of the pine nuts. Fabulous, thank you!"
2001613138,8650,2017-07-04,5,It has a nice zingy flavor with a nice bold flavor to it. A must have! it is a nice side dish with corn! Thank you!!!
2001617239,8650,2017-07-08,0,tried this recipe last weekend and boy oh boy...what a hit. Subbed the lemon with home grown limes and bam! BBQ thigh pesto chicken
2001633027,8650,2017-07-19,3,It sounded really great but when I tasted it...it immediately was like I had dumped pepper in it. Maybe it was the lemon (which I halved in the amount)? Anyone else have this experience?
742029,8650,2017-10-07,3,Entirely too much lemon. Needs salt and pepper. I think I'll stick with the recipe that came with my cuisinart.
2920881,8650,2017-10-07,4,"I made this tonight for pesto chicken linguine. It was my first attempt at making homemade pesto. I would normally just buy a jar already made but I have to say, I love the fresh version much better. I did add a little fresh cracked pepper and a dash of salt to mine. Hubby ate a big plate and went back for seconds so I'll keep this recipe to make it again."
5669231,8650,2018-08-01,4,DezygnHer Tweeks... Included a bit of parsley &amp; cilantro from our garden (some of the basil was NOT beautiful) Had no fresh garlic so chopped a shallot &amp; 3 tbs of jarred chopped garlic Used Juice of 1/2 a large lemon &amp; some of the rind EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil Added a touch of sherry / amontillado to help preserve
101823,205904,2007-07-19,4,"This sauce has excellent flavor.  I used it as a topping with Recipe #174102 and for topping frozen Nutrigrain Eggos, too.  My sauce didn't thicken much, but that could be because I didn't put it through a sieve.  I left the berries whole to float in the sweet syrup and top my breakfasts.  Yum!"
330505,275084,2008-05-02,3,"We liked these.  I'm not real sure if it is something I'll make often, but they were still good.  Made for the Potluck Tag Game.  Thanks for posting!"
162826,233025,2007-11-04,5,"Totally dÃ©licieux Francais! It ""crowns"" beautifully. Enjoyed it very much. Made for French Food and Fotos in Cooking Photo Forum."
222564,233025,2017-06-17,5,"Subtle, elegant and just right!"
18745,258733,2008-10-26,5,I have this exact recipe and it is awesome!  I have been making it for years and I have never been dissapointed with the results.  It is my DD's favorite so I made it this weekend for her and her family.  Thanks for posting.
233495,318720,2009-10-18,5,"I was going to post this same recipe on here and found yours!  I use my reduction for drizzling over my version of insalata caprese (halved grape tomatoes, sliced fresh mozzerella and chopped fresh basil) for a quick and tasty lunch!  Yummm!!  Your time for reducing is spot-on.  Thanks for sharing!"
142367,318720,2009-12-01,4,This was too sweet for me and I did not use the sugar.  Perhaps I let it reduce too much? Thanks for sharing this recipe!
1835812,318720,2011-04-04,5,So Good ! That was awesome !!!
925054,318720,2012-03-10,5,"Wow, who knew how easy that would be?!  Thanks for posting the instructions.  I used only raspberry balsamic vinegar and it reduced beautifully and concentrated the berry flavor very nicely.  Drizzled over grilled chicken and roasted veggies and was delicious!"
590859,10463,2007-09-20,4,"Terrific. My first shot at this business, and a big mess, but there are seven jars of real good-looking tomato sauce on the shelf. More ripening out on the vines.
Thanks ,

P.S., forgot some of the lemon juice, but hey, this is a learning experience, right?"
114681,10463,2010-07-14,5,"Not planning on doing as much canning this year as last (many reasons!) but you bet I will be doing this one.  Made about 16 jars last year, when they were gone they WERE missed.  I did pretty much just big chunks or whole tomatoes.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly using fresh basil.  They were fabulous in so many recipe's.  They tasted so darn fresh when you wanted that taste the most - in the dead of winter.  Thank you, even if I am off now to make the mess in the kitchen!  Easy, no disappointing, versatile recipe.  What's not to like?"
199848,264430,2007-11-13,5,"I never made a soup in a 13 x 9"" dish before!  It's quite interesting.  I used rye bread and that flavor really added to the soup.  I added some onion.... just because I always do.  ;)   The bread puffs a little bit but there is still just enough broth.  I used a Swiss cheese and parmesan.  I think that if you cut the amount of broth in half, you'd have a nice cabbage side dish.  Thanx for sharing this!"
8377,264430,2007-12-02,5,I love this! This deserves more than 5 stars. It's a delicous cabbage soup; a hearty comfort food. I made no changes except made a half recipe. And I used the rye bread/swiss cheese option. mmmmmm so good... Thanks for posting this keeper of a recipe Sharon.
232669,264430,2008-01-02,5,"Oh My Sharon123, this was delicious! Made it with rye & pumpernickel(didn't have enough of one or the other)and it turned out great what with the caraway seeds in the rye & the awesome flavors of the breads - it turned out fantastically! Used everything as stated except for using gruyere cheese as that was all we had! Makes a nice yummy soup and it sticks to your ribs. Thanks, Diane :)"
450571,264430,2008-01-14,5,"Warm, easy, and very tasty.  I used canned vegetable broth and it was still wonderful.  It would be even better if you took the time to make your own.  Thanks very much for sharing!"
594923,264430,2008-01-29,5,So tasty! I made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out wonderfully. I loved the fact that it was so simple to make. Thanks!
486725,264430,2009-12-15,4,Nice and comforting soup on a cold night. I did add caramelized onion and garlic to this and used less butter/salt/nutmeg and cheese. Thanks!
37449,39977,2002-10-29,4,"I like the flavors in this rub! The chili powder and cumin give it a Mexican flair. I tried it with hamburger, I think next time I will try it on roasted potatoes! Thanks!"
89831,39977,2004-05-10,5,"All I can say is WOW!...I made this rub, an marinated my chicken for 6 hours, then I barbecued it, the chicken was so delicious, with a slightly smokey flavour...this is a winning recipe for rub, I am making tons of this, and will keep it in my cupboard. Thanks for posting, I just love all of your recipes!...KC :-)"
65720,39977,2005-05-23,5,"This rub is AWESOME!! I rubbed it on some babyback ribs yesterday, wrapped them up in heavy-duty foil and refrigerated them for about 5 hours. Then baked the ribs in a 350 degree oven for an hour and finished by browning the ribs on the grill. They were so flavorfull and falling- off- the- bone good that this is the only way I'll make ribs from now on ( unless I try one of your other rub recipes, Mean!! :)Can't wait to try this on briskett or chicken! "
217067,39977,2005-06-27,5,"FABULOUS!! I used this rub on Danish pork ribs, wrapped them in foil, and refrigerated them for 24 hours.  Then baked them at 250 for several hours before browning them on the grill with bbq sauce.  Huge hit.  Great flavor (a little too ""zippy"" for DD#2---she's a wimp!)"
223896,39977,2005-07-30,4,I tried this out today with both new zealand tenderloin steak and roasted potatoes (i got the idea from sharon) It was pretty tasty. Like she said it was more 'mexican' than bbq. i wonder if it could be changed up to be more bbq-y (new word). i did enjoy it though. the perfect amount of spiciness.
128473,39977,2007-01-18,5,"Wow Toni, wow...this is one hot spice. I used it for my baby back pork ribs. I marinaded them in the fridge for 6 hours and baked them in the oven for 1 1/2 hours at 375 degrees.  They were incredible, very flavourful. With lovely degrees of heat...layers of them...the heat lasted for about 10 minutes...next time I will use a little sparingly...thanks so much for sharing...we really enjoyed this spice mixture."
89831,160482,2006-03-29,5,"Oh so yummy! this is so light and fluffy, and couldn't be more easier to throw together, I used sweetened coconut milk but omitted the flaked coconut.. mine took only about 40 minutes to bake, I made this dessert hours ahead and served it semi-chilled..thanks Kel, DH and myself really enjoyed this tonight for dessert...Kitten:)"
128473,160482,2006-07-14,5,"Kelbel this is great. I made the custard early in the morning and chilled it all day. I took it out 30 minutes before serving to allow it to come to room temperature. It was amazing. So creamy, light & fluffy, very flavourful.  I made my own coconut milk, and added a few sliced strawberries to the mix. I also used Bev's Strawberry syrup to drizzle over top. I'll be making this wonderful treat over and over again. Thanks for sharing."
8688,160482,2006-08-23,5,"This is a wonderful custard!  I made exactly as directed, adding a touch of coconut to the final minutes of cooking, to brown on top. This custard would be beautifully served with fresh fruit, a little slice of pound cake or a fruit sauce.  Thanks so much, KelBel!"
1048952,160482,2009-07-06,5,I loved the addition of the bananas!  What a great dessert and one that I enjoyed all by myself with a generous scoop of Cool Whip on top.  Yummie!  Thanks!
102526,160482,2011-07-24,5,"I am currently eating this heavenly dessert and had to rate it immediately.  There are so many things I love about this custard 1. it's easy - just mix and bake.  2.  it seems to be forgiving - I didn't have half and half so I used heavy cream and skim milk  3.  it doesn't require a water bath.  4.  it's delicious.  Only one thing I would do differently next time - instead of putting coconut in it, just put the coconut on top to brown and get crunchy - I guess I prefer my coconut this way instead of soggy in the custard.  Even so, I'm thoroughly enjoying this and my husband is too."
1802900684,160482,2014-07-07,1,There seemed to be a lot of potential with this recipe however it just didn&#039;t turn out the way I wanted it to.  The flavor was good but the addition of the egg whites to the mix made it taste eggy and have a texture like a quiche not custard.  I should have gone with my gut and only put in the yolks.  The coconut on top would also imprive the texture.  I will try again with this change and see how it goes.
39835,3496,2004-04-30,4,Super easy apple crisp for a large group. Thanks for sharing!
188415,3496,2006-05-13,4,"This recipe is very good and one that I use all the time. I just have one comment though on the sugar that it calls for: three cups of sugar is REALLY a lot. I cut down to one cup of white and one cup of brown and that's STILL a lot (for me and my company's taste). Just a thought to maybe cut back a tad on the sugar... but again, excellent recipe and great for company. Thanks for posting it!"
206377,3496,2007-12-18,4,"I found the topping barely covered all of the apples, so I added another half batch.  Next time I will just double the batch.
I made it for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.  Very yummy!"
183227,3496,2008-01-12,5,"I have tried a few apple crisp recipes but was never satisfied with the ""crust"" until I tried this one.  Very tasty and a nice crispy crumble with the addition of the oatmeal.  This is a great quick dessert and a must to serve it warm over ice-cream or frozen vanilla."
188078,36153,2007-10-26,3,"My boyfriend and I made this one night because we didn't have any semolina flour for making pasta, so this seemed like our best bet. It started out rather well but quickly turned into a ""what the hell"" situation...we ended up adding an extra egg yolk because the fat content was so low it wasn't holding together or behaving like it should have... I would make this again, but tweak a few things first."
49304,65071,2003-09-04,5,"Yum,Yum, Delicious. Everyone loved said it would be great for Thanksgiving instead of Sweet Potatoes. A good way to get the little ones to eat squash. Will definitely be making this again, Thank you Kree for posting."
35414,65071,2003-10-13,5,"Everyone was raving about this one at Thanksgiving! By far the most talked about side dish. Made the recipe exactly as written (must be a first for me!). The aroma was mouth-watering...nicely cinnamony. This recipe has taken the place of my regular sweet potato dish at Thanksgiving. Thanks for a real keeper, Kree!
M&Mers  "
45999,65071,2004-11-24,3,"I really did not care for this recipe but it would be great for people who do not like squash. I am a squash lover and I felt this recipe camoflouged the great taste of this ""misunderstood"" vegetable."
195879,65071,2006-11-19,5,I made this for our early Thanksgiving meal. I did pre-steam the squash until barely soft then finished the dish off as directed. We really enjoyed this and I will keep this in my holiday menu plan
4470,65071,2007-11-02,5,I love squash & apple together wonderful combination.  I used Splenda brown sugar substitute and cut it back to half and also cut the margarine amount in half - Still delicious  Thanks Kree for a tasty side dish
25983,65071,2010-10-16,5,Wonderful and simple!!
1628676,65071,2013-08-01,5,"Loved this. Used less butter &amp; sugar, &amp;dded a little quick oats to the topping."
514331,134557,2007-08-06,4,"This was great! I made it in a 13x9 pan, and the only other change I made was to add a tsp. of vanilla to the batter. I did cover with foil part of the baking time to keep the topping from browning too much, and it was still a little too brown for my liking, but the flavors were awesome, and I will make again! Thanks for the recipe!"
254614,134557,2007-08-07,5,"Wonderful! I made in a large heavy bundt pan, came right up to the brim. I was afraid it woulds spill over but it didn't. I used salted sun flower seeds instead of pecans or walnuts. I was out of nuts. It also looks pretty when cut, you can see the different layers of crunch. Also it came right out of the bundt pan and so it has wonderful grooves in the cake. I might put some food coloring in the crunch mixture next time to emphasize the layers. Very easy to make."
538011,134557,2008-01-09,3,I LIKED this cake.  I made it in a silicone bundt pan and maybe thats why it cooked a little strangely.  I had never used one of those pans before.  Flavor was great...
232886,134557,2008-02-05,5,"Very easy to make, and delicious.

I used a banana cake mix, subbed walnuts for the pecans and subbed plain yogurt for the sour cream. Everyone who tasted it, loved it.

I agree with another poster, it fills the pan up very full, but it doesn't overflow, and the flavor is delicious. Can't wait to make it again!"
312577,134557,2008-02-28,5,"This cake was so easy to make, but it looked like I spent a lot of time baking!  I gave slices of this cake to my office and dance class.  Everyone loved it.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cake.  This cake turned out really pretty with the layers.    I used a butter cake mix as that is what I had.  Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe."
164276,134557,2011-02-21,5,"Fabulous!!!   This was a great cake!!  A nice way to use up some bananas!!   I actually made a glaze using 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, some milk and a little coconut extract and drizzled it over the cake.  My kids can't eat a cake without frosting on it!!   I have made this 3 times and will make it many more times!!"
2000376954,134557,2018-04-24,0,"My goodness! So delicious, moist and the crunch was an added bonus. Brought the cake to work it was devoured by noon!"
1544208,208179,2010-04-16,5,I have made a recipe just like this for years. The cream cheese route sounds excellent. This recipe is also very good on a chocolate cake. My mother makes it with a white milk cake that she has cut in half a spread with raspberry jam. She then uses this icing and sprinkles it with mini chocolate chips.
609913,194420,2007-10-14,5,"Thanks for this recipie, I have always loved this dish and are now glad to have it on file!
Will be making it very often."
1190263,194420,2009-03-03,5,Thanks for this recipe! I've been looking for a carbonara recipe without egg for so long!
314579,175540,2007-07-05,5,"Absolutely fabulous, one of my favorites of the ZWT 3...made exactly as stated, but did use nectaries.  Thanks Lori!!"
65197,175540,2006-07-04,5,"Oh my goodness....delicious!!
I used brown sugar...but other than that followed the directions and ingredients as written.
Thank you Lori!!"
182010,175540,2007-06-26,5,"Ten Stars--at least!!!  This is SO delicious and SO beautiful.  I made this exactly as stated--the result was a bowl of glowing color--the blueberries absolutely gleamed, the peaches took on this wonderful rosy hue--glass bowls are REQUIRED for this dessert!  Four of us ate this--four of us LOVED it--somehow this simple combination of 5 ingredients results in a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts--yet the individual flavor of the berries and the peaches shines through.  I can see myself serving this in the future over shortcake or ice cream or frozen yogurt or sorbet, garnishing with fresh mint and perhaps cream--but this is also perfect by itself.  What a winner. Lori!"
143917,175540,2008-06-30,4,I served these over SF angel food cake. Substituted splenda for the sugar. Very yummy! I also used frozen peaches. Everyone raved over it and especially my Dad who is diabetic. Thanks for a new family favorite! Made for ZWT 4.
67656,175540,2008-06-30,5,"So simple in its construction and divine in flavors, this is one you are left wondering ""why didn't I think of that?""  I love the sharp contrast of fruit with balsamic and often enjoy it with strawberries or oranges.  I am planning to make this as an elegant dessert for a BBQ grilling the peach halves and pouring the blueberries and sauce on top. Yummy!"
144490,175540,2008-07-06,5,"Excellent way to dress up berries. I made this as one of the desserts I took to a dinner party last night. I used a raspberry infused balsamic vinegar and added some fresh strawberries. Topped it with the whipped cream from another dessert recipe that was sweetened with maple syrup and flavored with almond extract. Since I was serving this mostly to children, I skipped the pepper. Excellent dessert."
131674,175540,2008-07-07,5,"This was wonderful!  The sweetness of the balsamic vinegar and the bite of the black pepper added ""oomph"" to the dish.  Plus this looks beautiful...just an added star.  Thanks for sharing.  Will make again soon.  Made for ZWT4."
174096,175540,2008-07-18,5,"Amazing!  I love the combination of fruit and balsamic vinegar, and this is a real winner!  I used a little less sugar, and it was perfect.  Served it at the end of a large meal, so this actually fed 8 people for me.  I added a little dollop of whipped cream on the side- excellent.  Thanks for this keeper... I'll be using it a lot while blueberries are in season."
161047,175540,2008-09-20,5,Great idea with the balsamic!
865936,175540,2009-01-21,4,"I just ""lifted"" the blueberry portion of this recipe because I wanted a blueberry sauce to pour over a store bought cake.  This was easy and oh so delish-i-ous.  I am thinking, next time I will grill some peaches and pour this blueberry sauce over."
452940,175540,2009-03-10,4,This recipe was recommended by Chef #174096. I served it atop Recipe #168715 for a wonderful brunch item. The two recipes work wonderfully well together. Thanks for sharing!
143318,175540,2009-04-13,5,"Chef Kate is right...this is a ""10 star"" recipe, especially with peaches fresh from the tree and served with vanilla frozen yogurt. Ellie Krieger has a similar recipe using cherries instead of blueberries."
37449,175540,2011-06-25,5,Very easy and great mix of flavor. I enjoyed it alot. Thanks. Made for ZWT#7 by a Food.Commando.
714688,175540,2011-07-22,5,"DIVINE! Needed a last minute low cal dessert, and this fit the bill. I used a mix of frozen fruit that I had, and picked out the mangos to make the sauce with. I can't wait to try this with other fruit combinations, and try it as an ice cream topping. Thank you for posting!"
199848,148356,2006-02-07,5,"I can't believe that nobody made/rated this yet....this is FANTASTIC!  The banana and avacado go so well together!  I made it just as written, using 2 Hass avocadoes, 2 large bananas, onion, just enough mayo to hold it together and I added a pinch of salt.  Awesome!  Thanx for this recipe.  I'll make this often."
272684,148356,2006-08-09,5,This is very good! Thanks for posting it.
59064,148356,2008-03-05,2,"I suspect that my review shows differences in cultural tastes.A 6 year old, 3 year old and an adult ate this but weren't especially impressed. It is very sweet and this doesn't gel well with the mayonnaise which tends to overwhelm the avocado. Even the onion doesn't save it. I suspect that my downunder tastebuds just don't like this very US recipe."
7792250,148356,2013-09-06,4,"I made this recipe as written, but it was a bit bland for my taste. I made it with a red onion, so I added another quarter of the red onion for a total of half a red onion, and I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and it was much better. I will definitely be making this again and often."
41020,26534,2002-05-18,5,"Enjoyed, although I didn't freeze the banana"
40525,26534,2003-09-30,5,"Great tasting shake, but dates should probably be added first to chop them up a bit more (Mine just stuck to the bottom of the blender in clumps)"
186071,26534,2005-08-02,5,"Wow this smoothie is extreamly filling. After 1/2 a cup I was too stuffed to take another sip. The dates blended well, and the smoothie was a lovely creamy consistency."
160974,26534,2006-03-14,5,"I used regular low-fat milk and really enjoyed the smoothie. Even though I had chopped my dates, I still had some that didn't blend, which were tasty at the bottom of my glass. 

Roxygirl"
82648,26534,2007-08-17,4,Yummy but VERY sweet!
427184,26534,2007-09-13,5,"I re-hydrated dried dates in the microwave by adding them to a tbsp of water in a small dish, they were perfectly moist and soft enough to blend well into this very tasty smoothie. This is a very sweet smoothie, I might only use 2 dates next time out of personal preference. Thanks for posting, this is a keeper."
379138,26534,2008-01-10,4,"yummy, but even better with a dash of cinnamon!"
6357,107497,2005-01-04,5,"This is so easy and tastes wonderful. I love the flavour of cinnamon in this. I like to freshly grind the cinnamon stick and then use that powder to bring out the flavour better. Tastes very nice and goes very well with adults{because of the cinnamon}. I think you forgot to change ""unbeaten"" to ""beaten"" for eggs;)
Otherwise, it's perfect! "
242766,107497,2008-04-11,5,"Delicious! I have a recipe exactly like this (except mine has nuts), and it has been a long time family favorite. This moist cake goes together so quickly and easily and is so full of flavor.  I halved the ingredients and baked it in an 8x8"" pan for 40 mins. (until it tested done with a toothpick).  This would have been excellent served warm with some vanilla ice cream but I didn't have any :( .  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! 
*Made for PAC Spring '08*"
274467,107497,2010-10-12,5,"This was fantastic!  Very easy to put together.  I didn't change a thing.  Wonderfully moist, tender cake, with pieces of apples and a cinnamon-spice flavor.  Thanks for the new recipe."
386585,107497,2014-05-16,5,"Super easy and super delicious.  Even though it&#039;s Spring (and not Fall), this hit the spot.  I used Cortland apples, which gave it just a hint of tartness to contrast the sweetness.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
60895,12402,2002-11-13,5,"These were fantastic!  I halved the recipe and it was still wonderful and easy!  I plan to make these for Christmas gifts. Thanks, Ann!"
45999,12402,2002-11-18,5,I have to give this 5 stars.  Unfortunately I overbaked them so I only get 3 1/2 stars!!  25 minutes maximum would be the baking time and I'm sure they would be perfect.
249074,12402,2006-03-16,5,"Absolutely SUPER!
I used some of my smaller cutters, approx. 1"" -- the end result was over 8 doz.
I have NO idea how many became MIA as I was working in the kitchen and family members came through. I know they never hesitate to take at least 6 per snatch!
Recipe is now laminated and pinned to my recipe cabinet. (Hubby took the 2 cabinet doors down from above my work area, where all my flours and baked goods are kept, and covered the middle of the door in corkboard, leaving only the frame showing, so my favorites are always there and I no longer spill things on them.  He is a REAL sweetie!)
I would recommend this recipe to ANY level of cook/chef - the results are unforgettable!)

937552,12402,2008-12-06,5,"These were beautiful.  Mine were very dry tho, maybe something about the dry Alberta air, so I added an extra egg and they came together well.  Got about 6 dozen medium cookies."
41578,63889,2003-06-06,5,This is a wonderful salad!!!  I made it exactly as you stated and I wouldn't change a thing.  I am going to make it again this weekend when I have guests over.  Thank you Quantumgirl for sharing this amazing salad.  
27678,63889,2003-06-11,5,"Lovely, lovely, lovely. I can't say a bad thing about this salad. I made the dressing with fresh basil and used about 4 tsp olive oil and 2 tsp vinegar. It didn't exactly ""drizzle"" but it was tasty nonetheless and I liked how it turned out thick and almost creamy."
57787,63889,2003-06-13,5,This is a great new dish for those of us who low-carb it. (Monotony being the problem with a low-carb plan).  I made it per recipe directions - I didn't have lime juice on hand and so I used lemon juice instead.  Even my DH liked it!  I looked up carb values for the tomatoes and avocado - it looks like this salad has about 8-9 grams of carb per serving.  I'll be making this again and again.  Thanks for posting!
12628,63889,2003-07-20,4,"Great salad!  I didn't get the dressing to ""drizzle"" and added more of all liquids, but very tasty nonetheless.  This would be great served on individual salad plates as it makes such a pretty presentation."
92805,63889,2003-09-07,5,"I was looking for something moderately low carbs and high taste and enjoyed this easy to make salad.  Hard to think of ways to achieve that BLT effect I love without the bread..  This is an original one the whole family enjoyed.  I also couldn't get the dressing to drizzle..not a big concern, wonder if adding a little olive oil to avacado mixture might help spread it out more evenly instead of globs."
79466,63889,2003-09-16,5,"What a great salad.  I used turkey bacon.  I also added a touch of honey and a splash of orange juice to the dressing and dare I say it was the best salad dressing EVER.
"
55380,63889,2005-02-11,5,"Wonderful! As others have noted, I didn't exactly get the dressing to 'drizzle,' either, even with about 3 Tbsp of olive oil. I think next time I might increase it even a bit more (perhaps an olive/canola oil combination), but it tasted superb this way too. I used all baby spinach leaves, which worked well, and went back to add a bit of finely chopped red onion for extra color and flavor. Definitely a special treat, especially in a salad. Thanks so much for sharing! :o)"
22973,63889,2005-09-16,5,"What a great treat,this is the best tasting dressing I have EVER eaten.My gosh it was Sooooo good.I liked it being thick and creamy. That Dressing just makes this a fabulous salad. Thank You, Darlene"
121185,63889,2005-11-04,4,"Hmmm...This received an ""ok"" from both my hubby and me.  It wasn't bad - but we didn't think it was great either.  Kind of ""ok""..."
102672,63889,2007-07-01,5,"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!  I am a BLT and avocado lover so how could this salad have been any better?  My ONLY complaint was it took a LOT more liquid to get the dressing to a ""liquidy enough"" consistency than I expected, but oh how yummy it was when I finished!"
390420,63889,2008-07-08,4,This was very good. I subbed turkey bacon for the bacon. I also added feta cheese. I loved the the tanginess of the dressing. Will definitely make again.
46545,364732,2010-07-25,5,"OMG, what a delicious spread!  So good it's hard to resist overeating.  The spices are just perfect.  I used skin-on almonds and never baked it (wanted to get the health benefits from the raw nuts/oil.)  This was creamy and flavorful, perfect for dipping veggies.  What a healthy snack.  Thanks!"
41409,364732,2010-08-01,5,"This was amazing! 100 stars!! My cheese-eating friends ate is ALL, and siad they would not have know it wasn't cheese if I hadn't told them.  I actually followed the instructions and baked it low and slow at 200 degrees for probaly 50 minutes.  I did not want mine to brown on top, but rather look fresh, white and creamy"
1033241,364732,2009-05-03,5,DELICIOUS vegan cheese!  I JUST LOVE IT!  It's great spread on sandwiches or as an app with fresh bread.  Yummmmmmm!  Did I say I like this?!  I skipped the baking of this recipe & thought it was just perfect!
37449,364732,2009-05-15,4,"I made this, baking it and next time I think I'd like it even better unbaked! Enjoyable with crackers. Thanks for a cool vegan recipe! :D Made for Vegetarian Swap-May 2009."
394592,364732,2009-06-02,5,"<b>Excellent!!!</b>- I first saw a version of this elsewhere on line-where it was 100% raw so I went w/ that concept...the nuts were raw and I worked the skins off over the 24 hour soak (I did extra to make almond milk and pulp too)...to the cheese mixture I added white miso and rejuvelac (both add a nice punch to the flavor) - all rest of ingredients were the same, except no baking and I chose to add no additional oil at the end-just felt no need...I did <b>solar</b> bake it in the lovely sunny day :) :) ;) {it was the Memorial Day Holiday wkend}- we enjoyed it with raw crackers & I had made a cashew version too (a few days before) adding sundried tomatoes and dried chili peppers for a spicy chia/flax seed crust pizza...I am experimenting now with dehydrating slices of the cashew version as it is firmer...this almond version is no doubts the <b>BEST</b> non-dairy cheeze ever!!!! <b>LOVED IT</b> :) :) It is very rich, very special...it will be a new ""bring with"" &/or ""break out"" for friends and family...thanks for the wonderful recipe share:)"
451456,364732,2009-08-08,5,"I've tried quite a few vegan cheeses, both store-bought and homemade, and I have to say this is one of the best.  I omitted the herb oil but it was still wonderful.  I tried some as a dip with veggie chips before baking, but baked most of it.  Next time I will probably bake it longer because it was still creamy (not crumbly) in the center.  It was wonderful with a meal of falafel, hummus, rice, and sauteed veggies.  I know I will find a million other ways to enjoy it.  Thanks for posting!  Made for Veggie Swap 13"
826456,364732,2009-08-16,5,"Amazing! I didn't even blanch the almonds, and I didn't notice you needed a cheesecloth, so basically I just ground up some almonds and garlic in the food processor, and it was still magnificent. Definitely saving this :)"
599450,364732,2009-09-12,5,"This transcends vegan, vegetarian, meat-loving, whatever! This is OMG delicious! I used Wish I Could Cook's tip to use a small casserole - perfect! I believe the 1/4 cup oil is okay for the finished product, drizzled on as you chip away at the dip; I used only a few tablespoons of a rosemary-infused olive oil. The baking wasn't specified, so at first I did 300F, which isn't enough to brown it, so I continued for another 20 minutes at 400F, which did the trick. Not sure I'd be raving about this without baking it first! The raw garlic â€” I dunnoh?! I will be making this for everyone who passes through my door and wants a spectacular appetizer! :) Thanks, Wish I Could Cook! Made for Veggie Recipe Swap."
482933,364732,2009-09-26,5,"Excellent!  Actually easier to make than it first looks-it just needs waiting time.  Told DS to bake it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes (was gone walking with my grandbaby) but now think it should have baked at a higher temperature so it would have browned more like in mersaydees' picture.  Maybe 375 for 40 minutes?  I did use all the oil and should NOT have but just forgot to reduce it. Thanks Wish I Could Cook for sharing. Made for Theirs, Yours, & Mine tag."
953275,364732,2010-05-17,5,"Delicious!  I really like this recipe, and I'm sure I'll be making many more times.  I cooked mine on about 375 and it browned a little too much, or maybe I should have used more oil...but didn't really matter, it was warm and delicious and a nice addition to my ""cheese"" plate!  Thanks WICC!  UPDATE...Made again for a party, this time cooked at 350 for about 40 mins and then under the broiler for 2 minutes to really brown the top.  My guests wanted the recipe, they weren't quite sure exactly 'what' it was, only that it was delicious!!"
1356721,364732,2011-01-30,5,This turned out very nice!!  Such a lovely texture and the flavor was great as well.  I served with crackers & carrot sticks.  We tried some unbaked and think that was just as good!!  I used two little ramekins to bake them in and they turned out great.  I didn't keep them on the high temp the whole time though because they did start to brown too much.  I would just recommend peaking in about half way to make sure your not overcooking.  Made for Veg*n Swap 31!!  Thanks so much WICC!!
498271,364732,2011-03-09,5,"This is a very tasty and healthy spread!  It doesn't taste like any kind of cheese to me but it's still delicious.  I baked mine in a ramekin at 375 for 40 minutes, then turned it out and let it cool before topping with the herbed oil.  I served it on whole grain melba rounds and enjoyed this tasty treat - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for the Best of 2010 Event (recommended by magpie diner)"
1926587,364732,2011-06-07,5,"This was absolutely amazing, I've tried making cashew cheese plenty of times using this recipe: http://www.fourgreensteps.com/community/recipes/appetizers/hard-cashew-cheese but almonds are also great! I fed this to my non-vegan boyfriend and he loved it :)"
1953913,364732,2011-07-13,5,"Amazing, amazing, amazing!!!  Just threw this raw into a lasagna in place of ricotta and it was to die for!!  Thanks so much for this recipe - I will be using it for EVERYTHING!!!!"
358284,364732,2011-11-01,3,I would love to give this 10 stars except with 153 out of 171 calories in this recipe being fat I think it has much room for improvement. Don't get me wrong it is delicious but one tiny little serve is almost a whole days fat allowance and you may as well eat pure fat. Not to mention it is impossible to stop at one serve. I make this regularly but I only use 2 tbsps in with the almonds and I make the oil but only brush it over the top and put all the herb out of the oil on aswell. It tastes just as good but cuts the calories way down. Thank you for posting
96796,364732,2012-07-07,5,"I couldn't be happier to have found this recipe - it's as amazing as everyone says!  Mine turned out like a cross between ricotta and feta (my favorites!).  Here's what I did:  I soaked slivered blanched almonds for 21 hours, made the mixture in the food processor, then strained it in a strainer lined with a coffee filter (a great alternative to cheesecloth, since that can be hard to find).  I only strained for 3 hours, and I'm guessing the full 12 hours would make the final product more crumbly and less ricotta-like (either way, I'd be happy).  I put the mixture in two small ramekins sprayed with vegetable spray, baked for 10 minutes at 400, then 20 minutes at 350.  This gave the cheese a nicely browned top that looked beautiful.  I only had time to chill for 4 hours, then I turned them out and topped them with the olive oil and herbs.  The presentation was gorgeous, and my dinner guests absolutely LOVED it.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of all kinds of ways to use this.  To use the cheese in it's creamy form (unbaked), I would suggest using a clove of roasted garlic to avoid the raw flavor of garlic, and I'd also cut back the lemon juice just a bit.<br/><br/>I know I'll use this recipe a million more times, so thanks so much for posting it!!"
1328942,364732,2013-01-31,5,"This is delicious! I have made this twice already. I soaked my almonds then blanched them myself. You really don't need to use parchment paper, just spray your dish with oil first. I baked mine at 425 for 30 minutes. It browned beautifully. I also agree that 1/4 cup oil is too much so I cut back to a few tablespoons. Lastly, Canthelpmyself, it's in poor taste to rate this recipe low simply based on the fat and calorie content. This isn't a site for rating the nutritional value of a recipe!"
1802652662,364732,2014-04-08,5,The best vegan cheese ever!
2001440992,364732,2017-03-17,5,"I loved the recipe. I used to buy that cheese from a girl who used to make it but she closed her business... so, this recipe has made me smile and happy again. It's so delicious. I added nutritional yeast and didn't use all that olive oil the recipe suggests. I only used 1 tbs and the rest were 3 tbs of canola oil. It tastes sooo good :-D Million thanks for this recipe. Greetings from Ecuador :-D"
6357,101253,2004-10-06,5,"This is one of my favourite carrot cakes. It's really filling. I love the addition of cinnamon in this recipe. I have not tried the frosting, but just the cake. Thanks for sharing!"
89831,12660,2005-07-07,5,"Great frittata Lennie!  I used two large eggs with one egg white. As Country lady did, I also through in some hash browns and that worked out well, great mix of veggies here, I really enjoyed this with a small salad. Thanks for sharing!...Kittencal:)"
5060,12660,2005-06-01,5,"I doubled this for the two of us, it was quite delicious!  I used up bits and pieces from the fridge, onion, chives, jalepeno, broccoli, green pepper, mushrooms, tomato,diced and sliced, ham, parsley and cheddar and dried basil. It turned out a nice combination, this will be a good one to clean out the fridge.
Thanks for sharing!"
52543,12660,2005-06-04,5,"A tasty weekend breakfast dish - and so much healthier than those fat loaded sausages or bacon! I used fresh from the garden chives instead of green onions, mozarella cheese & threw in a handful of Cavendish Farms frozen hash browns.
Since I doubled the recipe & I was concerned about overflowing, I placed the veggies into a deep dish pie, poured the eggs over top, then added the cheese & a liberal shaking of lemon pepper. I probably won't use zucchini next time as I found it too squishy. Thanx Lennie!"
59473,12660,2005-06-22,5,"Great tasting easy dish. I also doubled the recipe. I used tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. I will certainly be making this again. Thanks Lennie."
11297,12660,2005-07-09,5,"Easy to make. I used 4 eggs, zucchini, tomato, mushrooms, spring onions,red pepper, green pepper, and minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt & lots of freshly ground black pepper and grated parmesan cheese.
Yum!! Thanks for posting such a versatile recipe:)"
185991,12660,2005-10-09,4,Good stuff.
154574,12660,2006-02-02,5,"I made this a few weeks ago and several times since and each time it has been amazing. It's so easy and very versatile. It works well with just about any vegetables. The first time I made two separate frittatas - one for myself and the other with a about 1/2 a teaspoon of chilli flakes and a bit of extra salt and pepper for my fiance. He loved it and has since made a couple for himself as a quick lunch. I've also tried it with chopped chicken breast, but I don't think I liked it as much as with just plain vegetables. I think it would be very good with a small amount of bacon or ham thrown in, which I plan to try soon. Thank you Lennie for this wonderful recipe."
183872,12660,2006-02-07,5,"Woo-Hoo! You have achieved egg perfection (perfEGGtion, perhaps?)! Although I changed all the veggies, I'm giving you 5 stars for the method, the ease of preparation, and the fact that you saved me from having to be a kitchen mathematician! Yes, Lennie. Perfection."
45999,12660,2006-02-13,5,"This frittata is one terrific dish. I used mushrooms, green onions, zucchini, tomato, asparagus and green beans.  I used mozzarella cheese as I had a bit left over but cheddar would be great as well. I forgot the basil so I can imagine how much better that would have made it.  I'm always looking for different things to make for lunch and this one certainly fills the bill."
309648,12660,2006-05-06,5,"Great recipe. Easy and adaptable. Made it for two people adding an extra egg [5 total]  Left out the cheese and potato, added celery  and used portabello mushrooms , green pepper and  2 cloves fresh garlic .  "
286702,12660,2006-05-16,5,"wonderful brunch idea! i made it for myself, but was quite a bit for one serving, and ended up sharing it with my mom and dad, who both really liked it. my mom asked me to make it again for the whole family. the fresh tomato really gave it a great touch. i will be making this one many times     %  "
324621,12660,2006-09-25,5,"EXCELLENT meal!! Even my 2 toddlers ate it. I watched amazed as they gobbled up zucchini, tomato and mushrooms! I thought it was delicious and will most definately be making again!"
244264,12660,2007-01-06,5,"I made this for breakfast this morning.  DH and I are just starting on a diet.  We're not going fanatic on it, but just trying to make sure what we put in our mouths is healthy.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and used broccoli instead of zucchini, and added some chopped green pepper, sliced carrot, and shallots.  I added a little skim milk to the beaten eggs, a few slices of swiss cheese in addition to the cheddar, and sprinkled some nutmeg on the top.  It was great - DH said, ""That's actually sort of good.""  Believe me, that's a compliment!"
342468,12660,2007-01-20,5,"This is now one of my favorite quick and easy meals, which I make often.  I usually make it with zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes.  I leave out the potatoes and green onions.  Even my husband loves this light meal and we think it tastes great with toasted whole wheat english muffins."
214974,12660,2007-03-22,3,"This is a great brunch dish or when u have guests visiting. Just throw it all together and bake and spend the rest of the time with your guests. Tastes great, i did add some shredded parmagiano reggiano."
471609,12660,2007-06-24,4,I just love eggs and experimenting with every kind of veggie or meat combo. When the recipe calls for potatoes though I tend to reach for the ever handy bag of hash browns in the freezer and they work as well with a dollop of cream. As Lennie points out you can use any veggie or cheese and it comes out sensationally. H doesnt like a heavy lunch so I tend to do 2 omelettes a sandwich and 2 soups in a week. This is the best recipe to play with for variety.
534653,12660,2008-04-10,5,"This Baked Frittata for One was great. I actually tripled it to make it for 3 people, everyone loved it. I will make this again for sure. I served for dinner with garlic bread (cheese and bacon). Thanks for sharing!"
347909,12660,2008-07-11,5,"Not sure if I should rate this as I changed a LOT of it, but it was a frittata for one (me for my lunch).  I used everything from my garden (apart from the 3 eggs & cheese) - zucchini flowers, chives, fresh thyme and basil.  I mixed everything but the cheese and cooked in a small saute pan with butter and olive oil for 4 minutes, then sprinkled Emmenthal cheese on top and put the pan under the grill for a further 3 minutes to cook the top.  It was brill, although next time I'll saute some zucchini flesh and perhaps some onion too.  Leftover cooked potato would be really good and some tomato as soon as ours ripen in the greenhouse."
450571,12660,2009-03-07,4,Quick and easy but kind of bland for us.  I had to cut back on the mushrooms because 6 would have been all we tasted if we had used them all.  Thanks for sharing!
1197584,12660,2009-07-11,4,"Delicious and flexible recipe -- I used lots of zucchini, green and white onions, garlic and fresh dill, since that's what was in the fridge this week. But I can imagine lots of good veggie combinations, depending on whats available."
38513,12660,2009-07-12,5,"Made this for breakfast today and it was awesome!  I used what I had handy - some coppa, tomatoes, mushrooms, parsley, green onions, chevre and five eggs - was making this for more than one person!  It was all gone pretty quickly."
68460,12660,2012-03-13,5,"This made a really quick and delicious lunch for us today.  I used leftover veggies....asparagus, mushrooms, chopped baby potatoes (boiled & sauteed), cheddar cheese and seasoned with chives, basil, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I made this for two so I used 5 eggs and it was perfectly sized for a standard pie tin.  I hate throwing away small amounts of cooked vegetables so this is a great recipe to use them up for lunch the next day.  I'll definitely be making this again, especially as soon as my chicks grow up and start giving me fresh eggs!  Thanks for the recipe Lennie :)"
798070,12660,2013-09-14,5,"Loved it!  Used all veggies from the garden including kale, eggplant, beans, onion, carrot, and tomato. I also increased to 3 eggs since it looked like it needed it. Used parsley from the garden too!  It&#039;s best to use a strong cheese, I think. Will definitely make again, and thanks for posting."
1803099400,12660,2014-09-10,5,"This is a great recipe on the basic making of a frittata! I had never made one before, so this recipe was perfect on teaching me the basics! The first time I used this, I used a pie plate, but the second time I used a little round cake pan, and it came out just as great! DON&#039;T forget to grease a pie plate WELL if you&#039;re using one. This recipe is so perfect, it&#039;s the same baking time pretty much for however many eggs you add! Thanks for teaching me to finally bake one of these things! No more basic omelets for this gal!"
2317106,12660,2016-10-07,5,"This was a wonderful start. I never had made a fritatta before. The first time I made it in a regular pie plate but it came out too thin. So I went on Amazon and found mini pie plates that ended up making the perfect size. This morning I used two large eggs with a couple of teaspoons of milk mixed in: a little ground sea salt and pepper into the eggs. I sauteed in butter, a few sliced mushrooms, a little red onion and green onions, a leftover cooked sausage patty crumbled and a few cooked leftover diced potatoes as that is what I had. Next time, I will use more veggies like diced tomatoes and spinach or kale. As a reminder, don't forget to grease your baking dish. I used coconut oil spray."
233738,117716,2005-09-11,5,"This recipe is great for a snack, and would definitely work at a party too.  I used pecans instead of peanuts because that's what I had.  The only other thing I changed was to add a bit of milk to the dip-- block cream cheese isn't quite soft enough for a dip on its own."
468146,292010,2008-11-29,5,"Ally-Kat what a good recipe to do what ever you want with. This was great for a quick dinner after shopping Black Friday. I had some leftover sauce I needed to use so I put it in place of store bought. I also added black olives, onions, garlic, red and green peppers. YUMMY! I will make again! Mad for My 3 Chefs '08."
179133,292010,2011-03-30,5,"Excellent! Instead of cutting the tortillas in half, I just layered the ingredients on one side and folded the other side over to cover. The quantities of ingredients listed are a bit off (1 cup of sauce is enough for about a dozen quesadillas, or more, as I used about 1 Tbsp for one!) Anyway, I just used everything to taste, using hot peppers instead of pepperoni, with a bit of basil *and* parsley, since I had both on hand, fresh. This is a great, easily customized recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
1612775,201750,2010-05-09,5,"This was great, thank you!  I have an electric stove so it ended up taking me at least 25 min. for the dressing to reduce (about the same as the recipe, but some warned it takes less).  This was really sweet, but great!"
431813,201750,2007-04-26,4,"This was really nice.  I would suggest watching the cooking time.  I might be my gas range, but I cooked it about 8 minutes, and if it had gone on any longer, we would have had balsamic strawberry jam on our salads!  Really tasty though.  Thanks!"
353491,201750,2007-05-14,4,"We were happy to find this recipe.
So different. 
The original version is nice but we tweaked it a bit.
We used frozen sweetened strawberries, omitted the sugar and added a Tbsp or so of honey and a @ 1 tsp. roasted sesame oil.
So good."

867184,201750,2008-06-19,5,It's excellent. I like just sipping it at times. This is the first salad dressing that I'm willing to drench my salad in.
2132065,201750,2012-06-16,5,"Wow, this is a great dressing.  I substituted fresh oregano for the parsley and used half splenda and half sugar.  Made an awesome salad adding feta cheese and diced fresh strawberries to lettuce from our garden.  Grilled chicken breast would also make a very nice addition.  I give it an A!"

286566,322176,2009-03-31,5,"O'kay had to make a few adjustments for dietary purposes. Used 6 Granny Smith apples to make up 4 cups for 3 of us (and we were chocko's on it served with custard - could cut back to 5 apples for us), but blood glucose readings from the 2 diabetics dictated I had to cut the sugar back to 1 tablespoon (thank goodness we so much prefer our apples tart to sweet - hence the choice of granny smith) but did add more than a dash of cinnamon (love the stuff) and I was tempted to add some ground cloves (resisted the temptation - but won't next time) and because of readings did not add the golden syrup (did not have maple syrup) as planned.  Thank You Andi a very enjoyable easy dessert that was enjoyed by all of us.  Made for Every Day is a Holiday."
169430,322176,2009-04-05,5,"How easy can you get? I used Gala's  and 2 Tbsp of Splenda, perhaps a bit more than a dash of cinnamon and no-added-sugar syrup. The Splenda doesn't make a liquid as the sugar might but the apples produce enough moisture to allow so everything can be mixed nicely. Very tasty indeed and I think I'll try the pecans next time :D. Made for PAC, Spring 09."
136997,322176,2009-04-06,5,Yum! Nice little treat and is very easy to adapt to just one serving. I used one large granny smith apple and just sprinkled enough sugar and cinnamon on to suit my taste. I had some delicious Vermont Maple Syrup for this. The 4 minute cook time was spot on. :)
573325,322176,2009-06-14,5,"WOW, this is such a QUICK, EASY and YUMMY TREAT! Really, what more can you ask for in a dessert? The apples have a melt-in-your-mouth texture and the cinnamon-sugar-syrup mixture really enhances their natural sweetness and complements them very well.
I used one red and one green apple as that is what I had on hand and only peeled the green one. That way the dish was a bit more colourful and since I like the peel I think Ill stick to it (a bit quicker than with peeling).
I had it for breakkie today and enjoyed it so much, I might even have it again later. :)
Thanks so much Andi darling for sharing this lovely recipe with us!

I didn't make this for any low-carb reason (I don't give a rat's behind about ""low-carb""); I made it because I'm a cabbage enthusiast.;)  Plus, it's quick and easy to make.  I sauteed the cabbage with some sweet onion until tender instead of boiling it.  I'm not a big fan of ground beef, so I only used about 1 1/2 lbs, and it was plenty!  Just the right amount of sauce.  I put a bit of white pepper in the sauce, too.  Delicious!  Thanx for sharing this.  I will definitely make this again!"

Even though I have been making pulled pork barbeque for years and years, what a difference using the  rub makes in the moistness and flavor of the meat!  I used my favorite sauce (recipe #26794) Lee Lee's Famous Barbeque Sauce for Ribs w/ Preserves, leaving out the preserves for the pulled pork variation and the meal was out of this world delicious!

I did not even use any other sauce with it.  Thanks Charlotte J!"
141457,30949,2005-04-06,5,"I used this rub many times this summer, even gave the recipe to friends.  Makes a lot of rub so I halved the recipe."
26512,30949,2005-04-20,5,"I'm curious what BBQ restaurant you worked at :)This is a great rub. I used it on organic center cut pork steaks. Slathered them up good, then let them sit and soak up the rub for awhile before grilling. Served with grilled corn and salad. I love the little bit of sweetness in this, it's not overpowering, it's just right. I did add more cayenne than called for. Thanks for sharing, will make this often!"
126703,30949,2005-04-23,5,This one had the WOW factor. This is the best rub I have found in a long time. I am going to experiment with variations like using turbinado sugar and chipotle pepper. But this will be hard to top!! Excellent! Thanks. Buddy
31261,30949,2005-05-13,5,"This is absolutely the best barbecue dry rub I have found to so far!  What I like about it so much that it has a Wonderful taste and seems to make the meat really tender and keeps it juicy.  This recipe actually reminds me of an Emeril Live show in the fact that this recipe tastes “kicked up a notch” that it’s so good.
To start with I made it just as the recipe said and it was really good, definitely a 5 star recipe in quality, maybe just a bit saltier than we like, and just slightly more sweeter than we’d ideally like, just our personal preference. I really  love it that it seems to bring out the best of the flavor of whatever meat you use it on.  What I’ve found through trial and error has worked best for us is to use1/3 cup less sugar (1-2/3 cups sugar), and half the salt (1/4 cup).  For those who like more salt (like my husband, I don’t) you can always add more salt later.  
My very favorite thing to use it on is the frozen 4 lb. re-sealable bags of frozen chicken wings.  I take the chicken wings out of the freezer, put them on the “auto defrost” cycle on the microwave just long enough to get them partially thawed, which makes them wet enough for the dry rub to cling to the chicken.  Then I put the dry rub (not the whole recipe, probably about ½ to 3/4 of it) in the bag with the chicken, seal it, and shake it to coat all the wings. Then I let the wings marinate in the dry rub overnight.  The wings are partially thawed so it ”looks” like there’s about a whole bottle of barbecue sauce on the wings, which the liquid helps it marinate.  Then the leftover dry rub I like to sprinkle on the chicken when grilling on the barbecue (if I think  it needs more dry rub); if it doesn’t then I store the “extra” for the next time I need a great barbecue rub.  This recipe also works well in the oven.  
We do eat a lot of onions, and like the onion flavor in a barbecue sauce, so sometimes I add a tsp. of onion powder to the basic recipe.
Bottom line, all in all, this is one of our very favorite recipes, and I’d recommend it highly, as we use it often, especially in the summer when it’s nice weather  to grill. out ;)

153351,30949,2005-05-22,5,Very good stuff.It was a big hit.
184083,30949,2005-10-17,5,"I thought it seemed like a lot of sugar, but I followed it exact and it truly is wonderful.  All that sugar caramelizes on the meat and makes it so good!  Will use again and again."
250031,30949,2011-11-17,5,Nice & easy and great tasting! I just rubbed it on chicken breasts and baked them (it's 36 degrees outside) and they still turned out great! A nice all-purpose rub that I'll use again and again! Thanks for posting.
186660,30949,2005-11-08,5,Made the rub today and cooked the steak up tonight. It was a big hit. My 2 yr old ate all of his and asked my husband for some from his plate. My husband asked me to make this every day.  I personally thought it rather sweet and salty.  Will try the earlier reccomendation to cut back on sugar.  But overall the meat was moist and tender!!! Kudos to you. you should be in the top 40 with this rub!! =o)
192043,30949,2006-03-12,4,"This is a real good rub -- it may become my default ""base"" rub.  I was looking for a rub that didn't include a gazillion spices, because I wanted something simple that I could tailor if I wanted a specific flavor.  After reading other comments, I did cut the salt in half since I don't like very salty food (and used half coarse sea salt and half regular sea salt).  I also reduced the sugar by 1/3 and made it half white and half turbinado.   I used about a quarter of the recipe on a half rack of ribs -- tossed the rub and ribs in a plastic bag and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Ribs came out great, slow-cooked over hickory chips, with tasty leftovers for today (if the fridge hasn't already been raided!)."
318668,30949,2006-05-29,5,"This is WONDERFUL! Very easy and very good. I was a bit hesitant about how ""BBQ-y"" it would taste, but it was terrific. I made it on chicken breasts last week, and my family is asking for it again tonight!"
169169,30949,2006-11-08,5,I've always been a BBQ sauce kind of girl but like a dry rub every now and then but always when out at  a restaurant. I took There's advice to use less salt and sugar and I loved it. My husband had his mouth stuffed the whole dinner. I cooked a rack of baby back ribs with this rub. I only made half a batch and still had a lot left! I will definitely pass this one on.  
428546,30949,2007-01-13,4,"very good taste, i think i would like it better on chicken, tried it on steak, marinaded it over night but my steak tasted like rubber the next day, it was ribeye steak. will try it on chicken though. I like the sweet taste to the rub. thanks again!"
38181,30949,2007-01-19,4,This turned out very well.  Just the right amount of sweet and heat
173579,30949,2007-01-30,5,Excellent is all I can say!  We loved this!  We did add bbq sauce along with it.  Thanks for posting such an oustanding rub.
49542,30949,2007-04-05,4,Probably don't need another review but I think I'm the only reviewer to use this on fish.  I had some salmon that my DH wanted to cook on the BBQ and I chose this dry rub to use on it.  Turned out really good!  I may add a bit more Cayenne next time as we like a bit more spice.  Thanks!
59780,30949,2007-04-24,5,Outstanding! I made this rub as part of a Christmas basket to give out to family and it was perfect! I made extra to have some for myself and I used it on chicken it was fantastic. My brother in law used his on some steak and he requested another batch! Thanks for posting this great recipe!
445432,30949,2007-04-26,4,"Great rub...cut back on the sugar by 1/3 cup as suggested and used half the salt.  Tasted the rub before using and it reminded me of these mesquite flavored chips I've eaten before.  YUMMY!  Used on chicken and baked in the oven.
Thanks for the great recipe!"
186070,30949,2007-05-04,5,"Very tasty rub, I halved the recipe and used all brown sugar and cut the salt to 1/8 c. I also added some cumin and mustard powder. I used this on a chuck roast I was slow cooking in my oven and it was delicious, thanks for the great recipe.  Next time I will try it on chicken."
294000,30949,2007-09-01,5,Absolutely fantastic.  We were sick of Pappy's and wanted to try something different.  I halved the recipe as I didn't have enough paprika and we were only cooking a couple of steaks.  DH says this is a keeper.  This is definitely restaurant quality.  Now that we're living in MO we'll have to try out Mr. G's sometime!  Thanks Charlotte J.
37022,30949,2007-09-03,5,This was just great.  Such good flavor.  We all enjoyed.
26657,30949,2007-09-11,5,"OK, I tried it....ya all are right....this is awesome. Even my picky ""sauce only"" sister liked it!!!"
823947,30949,2008-05-11,0,This is an AMAZING rub!!!  Was skeptical at first -- shouldn't have been !!  Used it on a brisket and  Keeps it moist and tender!!!  No need for any sauce!!! WOW!!!! Will use this frequent;y!  Thanks for posting it!!!
579826,30949,2008-05-21,3,"I really enjoyed the flavour of the spices in this rub, however I found it VERY salty despite reducing the amount of salt to 1/3 cup. I will try it again but will use even less salt."
360813,30949,2008-05-23,5,WOW! Simple and delicious - that's what makes recipes great. Thanks for sharing!
140293,30949,2009-08-02,5,"This is so simple to make, and it tastes so good!!! on everything.  It makes a nice crusty finish on pork, fish, and chicken."
251626,30949,2009-08-26,5,Excellent. Used it on ribs and it was great. Looking forward to trying it on other meats.
429544,30949,2009-12-01,5,Made for Christmas gifts to hand out in Australia.  My DH loves it so hopefully others will.  Did cut down on the sugar as suggested by some.
120264,30949,2010-05-03,5,"Awsome!  Best rub I've used so far.  I did cut back on the sugar and salt and we loved it.  I think I've used this on every kind of meat and it works every time.
Donna"
8629,30949,2010-09-19,4,"This worked out real well for me as a rub for a pork roast.  The high sugar content did result in some very crispy, crusty pieces but I liked that."
915292,30949,2011-10-09,5,We had this on chicken breast tonight and they were wonderful on the grill.  My six year old ate more then my husband and I she loved it so much!  This would be great packaged in little canning jars and given as hostess or teacher gifts!
1256030,30949,2012-01-23,1,This was the first time I was making a rub on a grill pan. The pork chops got completely charred but the meat was rare in the middle so finally I had to cut it to pieces and grill like that. It got messy and the taste was so so. I am trying to think what the mistake was. Is brown sugar OK? Or maybe the flame was too high (it was on medium). Or maybe I should put some olive oil first. I will try doing it again because I still have some rub left but so far it didn't impress me much...sorry! Maybe somebody can give me some advice how to proceed?
620763,30949,2013-07-06,3,"This rub was just OK for us.  Tried on chicken, maybe it is better on other meats."
2001813666,30949,2017-11-21,5,Love this rub. We have used it on many meats and it never disappoints.
135566,308695,2013-06-01,3,"Very quick and easy alfredo sauce.  The white pepper adds a nice zing, but we really thought it needed garlic.  Served over pasta."
481092,405481,2010-02-10,1,I think there is a problem with this recipe.  When I made this it was just a very THICK paste and I could not pour as instructed on step 6.  I'm not sure if it's a typo with ingredient amounts 2:3 1/2 T butter:flour or if a liquid ingredient is missing.  Hopefully the chef can let me know because it sounded very interesting and I would like to give it another shot.
895132,405481,2010-06-11,5,"This was a nice treat! I used ghee instead of butter - 3 tablespoons, I guess, and approx. 1 1/2 tablespoons fine rice flour. That was so good - the buttery flavor with the sweetness of the dates. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for posting!"
47892,405481,2011-09-24,4,"For this recipe I used soft dried dates. Made as indicated using unbleached flour. The texture of the date topping is unusual-I loved the flavor but the flour mixed with butter had a grainy texture. I added a very small amount of rose water to the butter mixture; roughly 1/3 teaspoon. I would make this again but maybe reduce the amount of flour. If it weren't for the graininess of the flour this would definitely be a 5 star but I will give it a high 4.75 star rating! Most unusual! My mother in law loved the dates prepared in this manner by the way (""anything with butter is good"") ;) Reviewed for NA*ME tag/September."
30716,36247,2002-09-02,5,So yummy! The sugar almost caramelises in this recipe. I cooked it for 6 hours and I don't think I'd want to do them any longer than that. Instead of the frozen yogurt I served it with fat free custard. I'll make this again.
32772,36247,2002-09-23,5,Outstanding and so simple. Everyone in my family enjoyed this so much.  A keeper for sure.
82367,74386,2003-11-03,5,"This was quick and oh so easy to make,and all with ingredients that are usually on hand! The banana flavour was a nice change from regular french toast,and a healthy addition! My nearly 4 year old and my 13 month old gobbled this right up for breakfast this morning!Thanks, Marie! "
104295,74386,2004-06-03,5,"My 2 year old helped make this.  It was easy and fast and had wonderful flavor.  I loved that it had no sugar added, but it was plenty sweet with the banana.  A keeper!"
141293,74386,2004-12-11,4,"These were fast, easy, and delicious, but it did not have the strong banana flavor I was hoping for.  If I hadn't made this myself, I would never had known there was banana in it.  These were quite tasty anyway."
263275,74386,2005-11-23,5,I tried this recipe for breakfast this morning. The only change I made was to use 2 bananas instead of one - it was absolutly delicious - Thanks for sharing!
86764,74386,2007-03-01,5,"I made this tonight for the Alphabet Soup game with a super ripe banana and it was so good!  I did cut the recipe in half because it was just me, but I would serve this to any of my guests for sure.  Thanks, Marie, for a delicious way to use my ripe nanners!"
323389,74386,2007-03-04,4,"I doubled this recipe, and added 1 extra banana (so 3 total), using texas toast bread it made 10 slices. The aroma of the banana while on the griddle was just heavenly."
449700,74386,2007-04-15,4,yummy! very easy and flavorful - I used 2 very ripe bananas.
756573,74386,2008-02-18,5,I was hungry tonight and couldn't decide what I wanted- I had this weird craving for banana french toast (never even heard of it before). So I'm just getting up to start putting it together however I can think of and my boyfriend looks it up on here (the smarter way to do it) and got to this recipe. This was fantastic!! Definitely took care of my odd craving and also will now become a regular for our meals!
537188,74386,2008-03-08,4,Lovely! I had this for breakfast but I think next time I'd have it for a quick snack at lunch.
119859,74386,2008-06-08,5,"I made this this morning and it was fantastic. I used Texas Toast instead of normal sliced bread, and this batter was just enough to do 4 slices; perfect for 2. Thanks!"
839492,74386,2009-09-12,5,Loved this! Added nutmeg and vanilla to the egg mixture. Thanks for posting.
198154,74386,2009-09-28,3,"This was a 3 from everyone at our house.  In the words of my daughter ""It's ok, but I'd rather have regular french toast.""  We all ate it but probably won't make again."
4470,74386,2009-12-20,5,Great concept mashing the bananas with the egg.  It works! I served the French toast with blueberries and 2 slices of bacon  Lovely Sunday Brunch.  A bit of Maple Syrup would go well on them too.
674022,74386,2009-12-25,5,"Thanks Marie for posting this Gooseberry Patch recipe.  We made this this am  for Christmas breakfast and it was delicious and easy. It has a subtle banana flavor perfect for kids and adults. I doubled the recipe and used texas toast. The batter has substance and makes a lot of french toast. Nice when you want a change from the regular. Served with maple syrup, butter, and a banana garnish. Enjoy ChefDLH"
128473,74386,2015-03-27,5,"I love french toast.  This one was delicious.  Loved the idea of putting the banana into the batter.  It was so good, prepared this way.  The french toast bakes dark, but is not burnt.  It has a wonderful flavor.  Garnished with icing sugar and a little maple syrup.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for What&#039;s on the Menu? Tag Game"
424680,417125,2010-03-31,5,"I got a little carried away when making this recipe, in that I used 2 russet potatoes & 2 sweet potatoes (our yams, at least here in the USA's SouthWest!) & kept the filling for the 2 varieties separate! ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BOTH WAYS ~ I kinda prefer the yams, while my other half enjoys the white potatoes, so this kind of twist to the recipe satisfied us both, with a bit of each! Really enjoyed the 'chili' element here, & topped it all off with a sharp cheddar ~ My other half included the sour cream, but I didn't! Thanks for another great recipe! [Made & reviewed in Everyday's a Holiday]"
498271,417125,2010-05-14,4,"This is a great hearty potato that's a meal in itself!  I mixed a little pepper-jack cheese into the potato mixture as well as putting some on top.  Very filling, very tasty - thanks for sharing your recipe!"
174096,417125,2010-06-30,5,"Wonderful, filling potatoes!  I used homemade chili beans and included the optional cheese.  Very enjoyable!  Thanks for sharing.  Veg*n Swap 24"
539686,417125,2010-12-29,4,"Made for the Everyday is a Holiday game and this is a great, filling vegetarian dinner. Pair it with a salad our soup and you've got a great meal. Thanks for posting."
169430,417125,2011-09-10,5,"This jazzed up spud was dinner last evening all by it's self. Things got a little busy around here around dinner time and I didn't even bother to mash them, just mixed everything, the potato meat was so well cooked that it broke down on it's own while stirring the mix together. Very tasty and filling! I must confess to cheating a bit when it came time for the cheese I just microwaved it to melt. I absolutely make this again and next time I'll mash the bean filling and then bake it off."
286566,417125,2011-10-02,5,"Great lunch for the DM and I which we thoroughly enjoyed.  I used about 150 g of my recipe of recipe #226233 which meant it wasn't vegetarian as it has bacon in it.  I used 2 large potatoes which I microwaved for 8 minutes (making it super quick), also I didn't mash up the bit I cut off but put it on the top to one side to form a cap which went nice and crispy.  Thank you Lalaloula for a great lunch, made for Went to Market.  UPDATE - made this again this afternoon for lunch for myself and used commercial baked beans which I spiced up with some hot chilli sauce and served with a simple tomatoe and cucumber salad.  Thanks once again Lalaloula."
1179225,417125,2015-02-11,5,"I made this for lunch using homemade beans, served with a salad for great meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I&#039;ll be making this again when I have leftover vegetarian chili. Thanks for posting the recipe."
481092,321119,2008-09-01,5,"These are tasty treats.  Used my abundance of fresh tomatoes whose flavor really came through on these sandwiches.  Bacon and tomato with an added twist.  Felt like the pumpernickel overwhelmed these somewhat, but the chef notes that other breads could be subbed.  Personally, I think a ciabatta would really enhance this sandwich better.  Thanks for the suggestion Ms. Jack in my recipe search forum.  :)"
89831,321119,2008-09-10,5,"how can you go wrong with all these great ingredients, we loved these and I look forward to making them again soon, the only change I made was I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did, my DS and GF came over and they all went fast, thanks for sharing Mrs. Jack!"
326787,321119,2011-06-30,5,"Wow, soooooooo good. I used the full 8 oz cream cheese about 1/2 lb bacon and added extra horseradish to mine. Then I spread on little cocktail bread. I love these and my sisters did too. We took them on our little vacation and had us a picnic. They are like a BLT with a little twist. Next time I think I may add a tiny amount of sour cream to thin them a bit to make it spread easier."
238534,203615,2007-01-14,5,Made this for breakfast this morning.  Oh my.  Decadent!  I love how the bread puffed up when it baked so that it came out like a souffle. I substituted pure maple syrup for the light corn syrup.
37449,97094,2004-10-05,5,"This was very nice. I ""buttered"" whole wheat bread with this and then put on egg salad for a delicious sandwich. Thanks Evelyn!"
47510,118878,2005-06-21,5,"Rita, this was fantastic!  I made this recipe, cutting the ingredients in half, as a dip for strawberries.  For something so simple and easy, with so few ingredients, this was delicious.  The flavor of the pineapple and coconut was very subtle and complimented the fresh berries.  The dip had just the right amount of sweetness.  I had about half of it left, so I'm going back to the store for more fruit to finish it off!  I can't wait to try this as a frosting for cakes.  Thanks bunches for sharing this recipe!"
556011,118878,2008-02-02,5,"Rita, I thought this was wonderful.  I made pineapple muffins and served this with them.  I really enjoyed it, thank you for the recipe."

This frosting did double-duty as frosting and dip.I used store-bought shortcake base and filled the indentation with frosting and served a bowl of strawberries beside.My family loved dipping the extra berries in the frosting and getting to eat the cake base at the end."
664225,118878,2008-08-11,5,"I added about 1/2 c. fresh coconut to the mix for added texture and taste. It came out great!  I made to top Recipe #219079.  It was a great combination, and I know this frosting will be good on lots of other cakes in the future.  Thanks for the post!  Alexa"
2000804868,118878,2016-01-09,1,"This frosting recipe was pretty terrible. It was so runny I had to add an additional 12 oz of cream cheese as well as double the powdered sugar. Even after those additions  it still wasn&#039;t to a consistency that could be used as frosting.  It also tasted nothing like coconut so I had to add coconut extract.  I ended up scrapping it and using my tried and true cream cheese recipe, replacing the milk with pineapple juice, vanilla with coconut extract and pecans with toasted coconut. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this recipe for frosting. I decided it might be good as a fruit salad base so maybe I will use it for that...."
424680,210962,2007-04-24,3,"This was a tasty cobbler, but the directions were a little hazy ~ What to do with the rice milk, & when, & whether or not to peel the apples. So, I peeled them, & added some raisins, after all, a cobbler without raisins is, well...! Anyway, it all got put together OK, & the result was, as I said, tasty! Baking time for me was a about 22 minutes."
226863,173405,2011-03-17,5,So delicious and easy!  I used unsweetened milk chocolate squares....not sure if it mattered if they were dark squares or not.  Fabulous!
464220,256292,2007-10-17,1,"needed much more powdered sugar,unless you just want sweetened cream cheese"
22015,70278,2004-01-04,5,I love oatmeal cookies and these are so easy.  I didn't have much aggression to get out but I next time I'm frustrated this will be a fun way to deal with it! ;)
226989,70278,2007-04-30,2,"I think there is something missing from these cookies, I followed the recipe exactly except for using margarine instead of butter and found they just stayed crumbly and didn't cook evenly. Granted that might have been the oven, but I don't think so. I probably won't make these again."
95743,21414,2004-11-09,5,Made this with Frenched green beans.  Great ingredient combination and technique.
474876,21414,2008-05-11,5,I loved this!  I made it with local asparagus.  I didn't have scallions so I used a few slices of shallots.  I will definitely make this again soon!
1179225,386901,2009-10-10,5,What a money saver! Thanks so much for posting.
130447,211340,2007-11-05,4,"I loved these.  Others at my party felt they were too rich.  But as they were used for an appetizer, I don't think rich should be a problem.  We grilled these in the bbq and they turned out perfectly."
80353,211340,2009-05-28,5,These are a superb little appie - and so easy!  We are just getting our first apricots of the season and I used 9 for this recipe (scaled to half).  Also used the 'good' blue (Roquefort).
527886,211340,2009-06-02,4,A simple appetizer or dessert blending sweet fruit and tangy blue cheese. I used in-season peaches rather than apricots.
219942,211340,2012-07-31,5,"What an interesting combination of flavors! I didn't have a creamy bleu cheese, so I mixed a little bit of soft cream cheese with the bleu. It still didn't melt as well as I would have liked, but it was just delicious anyway. I couldn't find any small apricots, and my husband and I ate this as a side with our Country French Chicken recipe #409946. Fabulous!"
690623,458360,2011-06-13,5,What a nice drink!  I made it at lunchtime so did not add anything to it but I will throw in a shot of rum this evening :)  Yummy!  It tastes like a tropical creamsickle.  Thanks for posting!<br/>Made for Fod.Commandos ~ ZWT 7

303427,421313,2014-08-31,5,"This Almond Joy Bark was easy to make and tasty! I don&#039;t even like dark chocolate, but this combination was brilliant and I can&#039;t wait to make it again (though I will say that I did use unsweetened coconut, which probably helped a bit with the bitterness of the dark chocolate for me too). This was my first time making almond bark of any kind and toasting almonds/coconut as well, but the great methods you listed led to terrific results! Thank you so much for the great recipe! I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll make it again soon!"
1926335,421313,2016-05-13,5,"I made this true paleo by making my own chocolate chunks. This is so good, thank you very much for this recipe. I could hardly wait for it to set up."
25792,41797,2002-12-11,5,"Awesome is a truism here, we all liked this one.  Used the left over bread as dippers and the fact that this is not a cold dip was a nice change of pace.  Will be a great treat to take to next potluck at work. Thanx "
38418,41797,2002-12-25,5,I made this for our holiday get together and it was AMAZING!  I had to make another one in the middle of the party.  I used a sourdough round bread and Hormel Real Bacon pieces from a jar and everyone loved it.  Thanks!
26041,41797,2003-09-30,5,"I made this over the weekend while everyone was watching football, it was a big hit!  ANd of course a keeper too."
111005,41797,2004-10-23,5,Everyone at Bunco raved on and on about this it was my biggest hit of all of my appetizers.  I would definitley double this recipe for next time.
24226,41797,2004-11-20,5,"This dip was great!  Everyone at our party loved it.  I left out the onion and used 1/2 tsp onion powder.  I also used bacos instead of bacon. The only problem I notices was as I baked the dip, the bread got very hard.  I used pumpernickel, so I don't know if that was the reason or not. Other than that, this was really good!"
31364,41797,2004-12-27,5,"What is it about bread bowls that people adore so much? You can put almost anything in a bread bowl and people will devour it! *lol* This was a fabulous recipe, one we will definetly be making for the next get together! (If I can wait that long...)"
180459,41797,2005-09-29,5,"This is an awesome tasting dip....however, I baked it in a casserole because I didn't have a bread bowl at the time, and it produced an entire cup of grease!  Guess we don't realize how much gets absorbed by the bread bowl.  Will definitely make again, although I think I'll use a bread bowl and some low-fat mayo.  Thanks!!"
185285,41797,2007-11-09,5,"This was GONE, GONE, GONE by the end of the day. I used Sour Cream rather than Mayo b/c my husband HATES mayo and can taste it a mile away. I served it with Recipe#93429 (minus the caraway seeds b/c I was out) and I had people fighting over the bottom of the bowl."
666987,41797,2007-11-26,5,"I made it for Thanksgiving. Only change I made was use a little less onion than called for about 1/2 cup and really chopped it fine. Almost liquified it. And I used Shepherder bread instead of Rye.  But it was such a hit it was gone within 20 minutes and EVERYONE wanted the recipe. Next time I'll be making two instead of one. REALLY REALLY GOOD. And easy to make! Definately recommend. 

Eli"
745038,41797,2008-02-01,5,"I made this for my Uncle-In-Law's 60th birthday party (which was also on New Year's Day) and had people offer to PAY me for the recipe! NOW I have requests to bring it to a Super Bowl party this weekend and for a 90th birthday celebration later this month! Only being married now for a little over a year, this has earned major points within my husband's family, which is always an added bonus! (LOL) A million thanks to the godsend who posted this recipe! :)"
98016,41797,2008-08-24,5,"REALLY enjoyed this!  I made this for a party and everyone raved about it.  I used sharp cheddar, grated the onion and served it in an earthenware crock as I couldn't find a whole bread suitable for this recipe.  I served it with pices of roasted garlic ciabatta bread, pretzels and grape tomatoes.  Just lovely!!"
625696,41797,2008-09-07,4,"This was very very good - but I would make 1 minor change.  Next time I make this I will saute the onion & garlic first, and then stir that into the cheese/mayo mixture.  I used a sourdough loaf, only 6-8 strips of bacon, and 3 cloves garlic.  Really good as is too, everyone raved about it."
1228487,41797,2009-04-06,5,this was made for my bridal shower and it was a very big hit
1483520,41797,2009-12-14,0,"Everyone loved this dip, it was gone in 20 minutes! I used cream cheese instead of mayo and a sourdough bread bowl. I didn't even get to taste it cuz it went to fast! I did eat the scraped out and cut into bread bowl a couple hours later, even cold the dip left on pieces of it was really good!! I also only used half a red onion. If you make this be ready to pass out copies of the recipes too!"
632249,41797,2010-01-03,5,I brought this dip to my in-laws house for our New Year's Celebration. It was devoured in about 20 minutes. I used about 1/2 lb of bacon instead and that seemed like enough. I also used about 3/4 Cup of mayo and 1/4 C sour cream as I ran out of mayo. We even ate the bread bowl afterwards. Made for P-A-R-T-Y event. Thx for sharing a great recipe!
1320105,41797,2010-08-20,5,I made this exactly as written and it was fantastic!  There were a lot of rave reviews at the social I took it to and many requests for the recipe.  I served with sliced baguette pieces.  I will definitely be making again for other socials.
1776859,41797,2010-12-27,0,Had this receipe Christmas Eve at a Party- This is truly amazing !! yummy
514499,41797,2011-11-02,4,"This was a very easy recipe, and I had everything on hand. I baked it in a pie plate for 30 minutes and I didn't use the bacon. Everyone enjoyed it, some even ate it with a fork, though I served it with chips and got requests for the recipe. It was very oily, but the flavor was good. Next time I think I'll try to drain the grease off, or use ""less fat"" mayo."
175727,257678,2008-07-21,5,"i fry the onions till golden, then add in the salmon (lox) .. and this is a super recipe!!  I grew up eating it, have always done so and I also made this last week!"
452940,311449,2008-08-04,5,"I made this (using sour cream), then made your Recipe #314976 and used your idea of layering and decided to make a strawberry cream cheese pie. Very easy, very, very yummy!"
621626,311449,2008-09-21,5,"I made this using sour cream. I then made your Berry Dip & mixed it into the cream cheese mixture. I then pour the whole mixture into a graham cracker crust then froze it for 2 hours. Easy & simple to make, thanks! Made for 123 Hits"
424680,311449,2009-08-01,5,"Made this as a base for you recipe #312224 #312224 & it was a winner ~ I really enjoyed the ease of making this & definitely want to make it as a cream pie! Sooo easy! Thanks for sharing! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my group mates in the Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #31]"
58104,23784,2003-04-22,5,I mixed half oil and butter which a sauteed onion and garlic then added the asparagus. I also did have to add some of the pasta water to the pasta before serving. Was delish!
37779,23784,2004-01-16,5,"This was delightful, Eve. I steamed the fresh asparagus in my vegetable steamer, just until it reached that barely tender point. I also added a little garlic to the butter and then sauteed the asparagus. Made a very delicious meatless dinner. Really enjoyed it and left-overs were good the next day for lunch. Thanks."
116170,23784,2004-03-31,4,"I made this recipe tonight.  Yummy!!!  Very good I would have liked alittle more sauce for the pasta, but it was delicious.  We love both but it never dawned on me to combine the two.  I did use garlic powder and onion butter with butter and some of the pasta water.  My DH just loved it.  This is a definite keeper.  Very inexpensive this time of year!!!  "
48107,23784,2006-06-05,4,"This had good flavour, but I had to add almost a whole cup of butter because the pasta was so dry I couldn't stir it (I'd unfortunately already drained the pasta water down the sink).  I think next time I'll use only a half-pound of pasta so the butter goes further.  I got WAY more than 4 servings out of it, as well.  Good taste, just needs some tweaking to work out right for us."
156653,104734,2004-12-22,4," Good, however we needed to add some salt to suit our taste. We ate this with a chicken breast on top. Easy recipe! Thanks!"
133950,104734,2005-06-25,5,a very fast dinner! imation crabmeat makes it cheap and wonderful!
236193,104734,2005-08-30,3,"This was a very easy recipe to make however, the parmesan flavor was so overwhelming. I thought it was average."
232329,104734,2005-09-24,5,"This recipe was really ""To Die For""...I made it this weekend and it was awesome..I will for sure save this recipe and use it again again....Patti K"
364211,104734,2006-12-05,5,"wonderful taste, thought i was eating at olive garden.  very quick and easy.  i added imitation crab meat just before serving and it was a absolute hit for me and my son.  hubby didnt care for it at all tho.  just one of those things.  will be left overs tomorrow to enjoy now because i doubled the sauce.  thanks, pvt amys mom, for posting this yummy recipe."
449702,104734,2007-06-05,5,Loved it! Thanks for posting!
253974,104734,2012-03-03,0,"Since I have been using this recipe for many years, and love it, I won't rate it. I think there are over 1500 recipes for Alfredo Sauce here at Food.com, each very similar with ingredients varying a half teaspoon or so here or there.I just wanted to add that the way I serve mine is to have a bowl in the oven, empty, waiting so that when you are ready to serve, just empty the contents of your pan or skillet into the waiting, hot bowl. It keeps the contents nice and hot, so that the cream and butter don't separate too quickly. I hope this helps someone."
448342,493476,2013-01-14,5,"The Peach Tree Tearoom Cookbook  (Fredericksburg, Texas) has a similar recipe that I have been using.  The only difference is that their recipe adds onions (which I leave out) and parsley.  This is my favorite rice dish to go with a Mexican supper.  My husband likes the spicier version with veg. in  it, so sometimes I make both versions.  The Arroz Blanco leftovers go to make fried rice the next morning.  Thanks for sharing this recipe."
51199,96326,2004-11-29,5,"Pinkie, this is wicked and should come with a health warning! I made it exactly as written as it combines two of my favourite things - apricots and cream cheese. Addictive stuff, thanks so much for this one. You've been a great 'choose your chef' partner."
58104,122299,2005-05-31,5,Nice comfort food! I made with gound cardamom and fresh  strawberries. Thanks for the 5 STAR breakfast!
455042,122299,2007-08-03,5,I was raised on eating rice with sugar & milk. that;s what everyone eats in La. GREAT recipe!!!
180898,122299,2008-01-03,5,I usually use left over Jasmine rice and add sugar and coconut milk to it. This is similar and just as yummy. I made this in the microwave and used bananas rather than berries.
336058,122299,2008-10-25,5,"I remembered having this when I was young, but Mom just warmed it up, didn't cook it to creamy.  I love it this way.  I used brown rice and didn't add sugar.  It only needed a little agave nectar added to my bowl.  Added some raisins while cooking.  I had to simmer it for only 7 minutes and it was plenty done."
422893,122299,2009-05-18,5,"A lovely way to use up some leftover rice. I added some maple extract to mine & served with blueberries in syrup, yum! Even toddler DD ate this & she normally doesn't eat rice. Thanks for posting!"
1268187,122299,2010-07-09,4,"this was definitely a great way to use up the remaining short rice grains i had laying around (i traditionally use long-grain)... i added a little more sugar because i liked mine sweeter than the recipe called for...

i also tried mine with slightly cooked raspberries in caramelized sugar: DE-LISH!!!"
1361337,386901,2010-05-15,5,This works great and says so much money! Thanks for sharing!
232532,406546,2010-01-09,5,"This is one of the best frostings I have ever had. I use it with the Waldorf Astoria Red Cake and top it with roasted chopped pecans! Yummy!
Men like this a lot too because it isn't too sweet."
482376,296919,2011-05-07,5,What is not to love with this combination?! I used pita bread. I really enjoyed this combination and will be making this again for lunches. Thank you!
673444,296919,2009-03-20,5,"I made this with what I had in the fridge for lunch today and was going to post it myself, but found your recipe.  I used an english muffin, about 2 tbsp of hummus, 1 roma tomato, and half an avocado. It was yummy and satisfying."
398275,296919,2009-03-21,4,"Great sandwich!  I made a single serving and used roasted garlic hummus.  I also added sprouts, pepperoncini and sliced cucumber.  Thanks for sharing!"
644191,296919,2009-11-16,5,This turned out really great!  I added some lettuce leaves and spooned it into a warm pita.  My hummus also had some sundried tomato in it.  The creamyness of the avacado contrasted nicely with the tartness/saltiness of the hummus.  Thanks so much
65502,296919,2013-02-13,5,"Awesome lunch!!! I used roasted red pepper hummus, fresh pink cherry tomatoes, a slightly soft avocado and a small 100% whole wheat soft tortilla. Delicious!! Made for the Sun and Spice Event. Thanks Chef! :)"
452355,296919,2013-02-17,4,"This was a very nice sandwich. I made the hummus using Recipe #11424.  I prepared the avocado as indicated and used fresh sliced grape tomatoes.  Like other reviewers, I used pita bread.  This was healthy and easy to prepare.  Thanks!  Made for Sun and Spice 2013"
281399,284630,2008-08-08,5,"Good ratio of fruit and yogurt for me! I used frozen bluberries. I also used 1% milk and vanilla yogurt. Thanks for sharing this recipe, one I will be making again."
143318,284630,2008-02-29,5,"The reason I rate this as outstanding: it actually tastes like blueberries! There are many smoothie recipes posted that taste like sugar milkshakes. I made half a recipe with non-fat yogurt and non-fat unflavored soy milk, and it was a good sized breakfast for one person. It was tempting to add the other half of a banana but I'm glad I didn't because I liked the blueberry flavor. I know some people would think this wasn't sweet enough, and they could add blueberry jam or use sweetened blueberry-flavored yogurt. Great recipe with lots of protein-thanks!"
383346,284630,2008-03-01,5,"I used vanilla yogurt.  I did for 2 servings.  But only for myself.  My BF doesn't want to taste smoothie.  He says that he doesn't like the texture of any smoothies.  Anyway, it was filling a lot and so yummy!  It didn't bother me to drink 2 glass of this :)  Thanks Mersaydees :)  Made for Beverage tag."
280271,284630,2008-03-03,5,"This is so yummy! It's easy to prepare and full of good ingredients for you. I also cut it in half and drank the whole thing myself. :) In fact I'm drinking it as I'm doing this review. I used the low fat vanilla yogurt, low fat milk and frozen blueberries. It came out nice and thick and very cold. This is going to be my smoothie of choice from now on. Thanks mersaydees for posting."
424680,284630,2008-03-28,5,"I got carried away & made two of these smoothies, one using the ingredients listed & another one using blueberry yogurt ~ Both were great, but I'm slightly favoring the latter one 'cause the taste of blueberries was a little more intense! GREAT TASTING no matter how you do it! LUV those smoothies! [Tagged, made & reviewed in March Beverage Tag]"
285039,284630,2008-04-07,5,"This was a great way to start out the morning.  The flavor and consistency was nice.  Next time I might add 1/3 of dried milk just to boost the calcium content a bit.  I am on a smoothie kick lately, and this one is a keeper!"
678862,284630,2008-05-28,5,"A perfect breakfast for me!  I'm not a big breakfast eater, so I love smoothies in the morning.  I made 2 servings, and used 1/3 cup vanilla protein powder plus 1 cup of water in place of the milk.  I also added 1/4 tsp. apple pectin powder and 1 Tbsp ground flax seed, which helped thicken it up since I used more liquid than called for.  Loved it - thanks Mersaydees!  Made and reviewed for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #16."
327115,284630,2008-06-11,5,This was delicious and super easy to make.  Great for breakfast!  I will most definately be making this again.
808027,284630,2008-06-26,5,"Delicious!!!  This will definitely become a regular at my house.  I substituted Silk vanilla soy due to my lactose intolerance, and added a packet of Stevia and a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla.  Loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
734661,284630,2008-08-20,5,"YAY!  A smoothie that doesn't involve ice!  My husband makes a version of this every morning with ice cubes, which I find to overwhelming.  I used fruit-bottom peach yogurt and added flax seed and psyllium fibre to it.  Fantastic taste and texture, and healthy too!"
464080,284630,2008-08-20,4,Next time I will use fruit flavored yogurt to get more of a fruity flavor (I even halved the amounts of yogurt and milk).   I froze half of the batch to see how that turns out. . .will report back this evening!  MADE FOR BEVY TAG.
166642,284630,2008-08-28,5,This is wonderful with ingredients I usually always have on hand. I used vanilla yogurt this time. So good. Thanks for sharing.
96177,284630,2009-01-31,5,I always have these ingredients on hand and think this is about the best smoothie around.
894666,284630,2009-02-27,5,"I'm a huge Jamba Juice fan but was tired of paying $5 a pop for something I could whip in a two minutes in my kitchen. This is a great alternative to their Bright Eyed and Blueberry smoothie. I use plain all natural fat free yogurt and lite soy milk, it is the breakfast of champions! Thanks so much for posting!"
537937,284630,2009-10-02,5,"Boy is this good.  So rich and creamy.  The only addition I made was to add one packet of Splenda to add some sweetness.  My blueberries and banana were frozen and this like a healthy shake:-)
Made for Veg-n-Swap - VIP."
804550,284630,2009-12-16,5,Delicious flavor combo! I did added a teaspoon of sugar to give it a little more sweetness. Made for Made for Veg-n-Swap #17 tag.
1317418,284630,2010-02-01,5,"This is an astoundingly good smoothie!  Blueberries aren't one of my favourite fruits, but I had some in my freezer so I thought I'd try it, and I was blown away!  The flavour combo was great!  The only changes I made were to add about 1tsp. of vanilla and a dash of Sugar Twin, and reduce the milk to 1 1/4 cups. I will have to go out and buy more yogurt now, just for this smoothie!  Thanks so much mercaydees!!"
590105,284630,2010-02-03,5,"My kids loved this! And I liked it too. :) I didn't want to print, because it's so simple. So I wandered off to the kitchen saying, ""I cup blueberries, I cup yogurt, I cup milk, and a banana."" I did squeeze a little agave nectar into it after taste-testing. Thanks for the yummy yogo-drink! Reviewed for the Veg*n Recipe Swap."
1630666,284630,2010-06-09,5,"I made this recipe a little differently than suggested...I used 1/2 cup non-fat greek yogurt, 1/2 cup Silk Vanilla soy milk, 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, 1/2 a medium sized banana, a splash of vanilla and a packet of Splenda. YUM!!! It was so good, just sweet enough and it made one serving (a HUGE glass) for only 205 calories. Definitely going to be a go-to for my breakfast when oatmeal just isn't sounding good :)"
1414176,284630,2011-12-18,5,fast and easy.  Thanks!
94226,284630,2011-12-31,5,Super amazing awesome!
126440,284630,2012-02-12,5,Loved it.  I made half a recipe but with one banana.  Both blueberries and banana were frozen so came out nice and thick.
2000055672,284630,2015-05-18,5,I whipped it up this afternoon with my two daughters.  They split it and loved it!!  We will definitely be making it again.
2001123810,284630,2016-08-11,5,"Smoothie tasted lovely, only thing I would change is next time use half a banana as I found it overpowered the blueberry a little bit."
2001172310,284630,2017-01-05,5,"I used fresh fruit and added ice, orange juice,honey and used vanilla yogurt (I usually add that instead of plain)."
2001620506,284630,2017-07-15,0,Thu. It was good and added a little honey.
2001757001,284630,2017-10-18,5,I have tried . It was awesome bit soar for my kids that is why i added more sugar for them
347136,31213,2007-10-30,2,"It wasn't as sweet as I was expecting. Eight minutes of boiling and the carrots were VERY soft. I'd blanch them instead of boiling. Doesn't reheat well, either."
41578,31213,2002-07-01,5,"I love carrots, but sometimes they can be a bit boring and you run out of ways to prepare them.  This is a wonderful change!  I loved the sweetness of them.  I had one lonely green bell pepper in the refrigerator so I chopped it up and added it to the carrots.  Thank you for sharing this."
129958,31213,2004-07-24,5,"Thank you Anu, I loved this recipe.  Extra stars for just a few simple ingredients!  DH and I really enjoyed them.  Definitely a keeper!"
53368,31213,2006-02-11,5,"These were nice and tasty! :) DD hates carrots, so when she saw I was making them, she started whining.  I told her she had to eat at least a few slices.  While she didn't proclaim them absolutely fantastic, she did eat them without a fuss, which in my book is a success. These were definately on the sweet side though, and I couldn't eat too many.  Luckily I served them with chicken and baked potatos, so the sweetness worked well with the other two dishes.  Thanks for posting this!  It's a keeper for me. :)"
154853,117738,2008-04-11,4,"Indeed this did fill the craving for stuffed cabbage rolls, which are a lot of work.  Thank your for posting this meal in one dish.  Made for PAC 2008"
451645,42992,2007-03-07,5,"OH Yeah! This is what I'm talkin about. I can make this for the weekend treat and I'll be able to eat it all myself. Well, maybe I'll share alittle. Thanks for the recipe."
306246,42992,2007-06-16,4,My whole family loved this... I'm making it for a morning tea meeting with friends as well.
296809,42992,2007-06-30,5,"Sinfully tasty & easy to make. Used nutmeg instead of cinnamon, baked in creme brulee cups & served w/fruit on the side. Was a hit w/my husband & mother-in-law & will try soon at a dinner party. Thx. EDITED TO ADD: This was the 1st recipe I reviewed after finding this site. I loved it then, love it now & thot it deserved a pic. :-)"
638870,42992,2010-04-20,5,"Great tasting rice custard. Easy prep, however, the milk does not need to be scalded. That's an unnessicary step."
1589471,42992,2010-10-01,5,"I ADORE this recipe.  In fact, I recently substituted thawed frozen raspberries and it was a huge hit!<br/>(I also do half and half of lemon/vanilla extract.)"
2001168634,42992,2016-09-14,5,"This is delicious and very easy to make. I was looking for a new breakfast idea and this custard is PERFECT! Eggs, milk, rice, raisins all make a very nutritious and delicious breakfast treat. I could easily eat this as a dessert too. I followed the recipe for the most part but did not scald the milk or add the butter. I know I will be making this often."
2001170316,42992,2016-09-16,5,Very nice &amp; easy receipe instead of rice put macaroni boiled the macaroni first then added the other ingredients except raisins 35 minutes it took very yummy &amp; creamy
655731,42992,2016-11-07,5,This was easy and came out delicious!
2001545657,42992,2017-05-20,4,Thoroughly enjoyed result I substituted raisens for dates. Delicious.
2002245360,42992,2018-08-11,4,looks and tastes just like my moms
122175,81024,2004-04-12,5,Had this for Easter!  Nice and spicy!
50214,81024,2007-06-28,5,"We always used green olives, which you have to like, but I'm going to try the ripe olives. This cheese is addictive!!!  We always made it around the holidays and served it with fancy crackers.  I had lost the recipe and was so glad mommydude posted it.  Yum Yum!!  Thanks again, Mommydude"
1655426,276978,2013-12-26,4,"So, I bought a day old loaf of cuban bread on Christmas eve with thoughts of making a breakfast casserole.  I got up Christmas morning and found this recipe.  I read it, and then read more.  I actually typed eggs, bacon and bread into the search engine for a casserole.  I was dismayed at the &quot;let it sit overnight&quot; part of the recipe and decided to try it without.  IT WAS AWESOME. The picky 13 year old even liked it. Thank you."
498271,270912,2007-12-29,5,"These little gems were delicious!  I needed something to serve with some homemade soup and these really fit the bill.  I loved the adddition of the cream cheese and the Italian dressing on top.  So easy and yummy, made with things I always have on hand - I'll make these often!"
593103,270912,2008-04-08,4,These were super easy to make and they were gone in even less time than they took to prepare!  Very nice.
162826,222479,2008-01-31,5,"Oh, Diner524, are the ever-so good!
 Made with a total comfort meal. Love them!!"
468945,222479,2007-04-14,0,This is a good way to prepare green beans !  I add a small can of peeled canned tomatoes to it...gives a kick.  Good recipe.
268464,222479,2007-04-16,4,Everyone enjoyed the beans.  I did use fresh beans (steamed in Microwave.  Had to keep the kids from picking out the meat.  Thanks!
305531,222479,2007-04-27,5,Great green beans. I used canned and we loved the zing that the cider vinegar gives this dish. Thanks for another winner diner524.
136997,222479,2007-06-10,4,Delicious beans. I used frozen as I can't stand canned. :) Made for ZWT 3.
392230,222479,2007-06-15,4,"Very good recipe! I used fresh green beans, but otherwise followed recipe. I had to extend the cooking time to adjust for my using fresh beans, but that was easy to do, simmering them on low, for a longer time. The whole family, and my guest, loved them. No leftovers always says it all! Thanks for sharing. Made for Zaar World Tour."
131126,222479,2007-06-16,4,"I used frozen french cut green beans for this recipe and then followed your instructions.  I did add cracked black pepper at the end of the cooking time.  The vinegar provided a nice tang. I served this with Recipe #212399 and Recipe #16859. 

Reviewed for ZWT 3."
133174,222479,2007-06-24,5,"These were made for ZWTIII using frozen green beans in place of the canned.  The bacon and onions were browned together and instead of taking the bacon out, the beans were added along with a small amount of water with the vinegar.  A nice way to prepare green beans."
17803,222479,2007-06-27,5,You can't go wrong with vinegar in a recipe.  This is another great bean recipe.  I forgot and added the bacon in the beginning. But that was alright as it added more bacon flavor to the beans as they cooked.  Made for ZWT III 2007 - United States Region
527665,222479,2007-07-13,2,"This was easy and I can see why some people would really like it. My kids didn't care for it, but then it is very hard to find any vegetable dish they will like. My husband and I found it just okay. This is one that I would encourage others to try because it is a personal taste type of recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
580861,222479,2007-11-21,5,"I've been doing green beans this way for years.But,I have never used the vinegar.In fact these or on our Thanksgiving menu for tomorrow but I will try it the way you have it written.Will let you know how they turn out.I've never had anyone say they did'nt like them.Thank you diner524!"
143721,222479,2007-12-09,5,"Excellent dish.  I have always believed that anything with bacon has to be good, but the vinegar ready adds to this dish.  Thanks for the new way of doing beans and congrats on the football win."
311003,222479,2007-12-15,5,"These green beans were delicious! I love anything tangy, but had never thought of putting vinegar into a recipe for green beans.  What a difference, they were terrific.  And we all love bacon so that was an extra treat.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!"
369715,222479,2008-01-19,4,These were good and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written. My children weren't thrilled with the vinegar but hubby and I enjoyed them. Ths bacon and onion gave them a good flavor.
337963,222479,2008-01-28,2,"I would definitely make these beans again, but without the cider vinegar.  THEY ARE QUICK TO MAKE PLUS THE ONION AND BACON ARE THE PERFECT TOUCH, but none of us liked the vinegar flavor so they didn't get eaten.  I appreciate you posting Diner, because I do really like the overall idea.  Made for Zaar stars, please see my rating system."
157425,222479,2008-02-10,5,Loved these green beans! I think they are very close to what is served at polish style buffets. I used turkey bacon so I added some olive oil to my pan. Cooked the bacon and onions together and used about 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Will definitely make these again!
248023,222479,2008-04-07,5,"Loved them!!!  I used cut green beans since I never buy the french style ones... and only 2 slices of thick, premium bacon... it was plenty!  I loved the tang of the ACV (Bragg brand of course!) with the savory bacon and onion.  Just delicious...  I should have made another can just for myself...  Thanks for posting!"
552613,222479,2008-05-26,5,I really enjoyed this as a side with our meal tonight.  The taste reminded me a bit of the taste of a PA Dutch three bean salad but warmed up.  My other half is always putting vinegar on everything anyway so he was happy with the taste too.  Made for the Zaar World Tour.
204261,222479,2008-05-31,5,These were fantastic!!  Bacon must be nice and crispy and onions must be carmelized.  Yummy!!!!!  Even the two year old loved it.  I used frozen green beans.  Thanks for the great side dish!
222139,222479,2008-06-20,4,They were o.k. for us. we liked the flavor.
677508,222479,2008-06-22,5,Made these for dinner last nite and we really enjoyed them.  I did use diced country ham in place of the bacon and we thought that added a nice flavour also.  I love using ACV in recipes and thought it added a great zap of flavour to the beans.  I also used a flat italian green bean and thought it absorbed the flavour well.  Made for ZWT4.
464080,222479,2008-06-22,3,"These just didn't do it for me. . .sorry!  I love all the ingredients, just not all together.  They were a bit bland (although vinegary), so I added a little seasoning salt and pepper which did help.  Only used 1 tbsp vinegar and frozen french cut beans.  Made for ZWT4."
130663,222479,2008-06-30,4,Very good and a little different.
361931,222479,2008-08-24,5,Very good and simple!  Will make again!
166642,222479,2008-08-28,4,"Very good and easy! I used only 1 1/2 T of the apple cider vinegar and that was perfect for us. I served this with ""Recipe#270382"". Thanks for sharing!"
169430,222479,2008-09-03,4,"I made this for the guys last night and they both gave it 4 stars. ""Really good"" and ""They are great with the pork chops"" were heard at the table. The recipe is certainly easy to make. I used 1 1/2 tbsp of the vinegar, one thought it was too heavy and the other said it was just right. They both said that they would be happy to have then again. Thanks Diner for an easy veggie that the men will eat!"
37636,222479,2008-10-01,4,"I loved the flavor of this! I often make green beans in a similar way using fresh beans. I may continue to do that in the future since the canned beans almost cooked into a mush trying to cook the vinegar out. I feel that fresh beans would hold their shape better. The flavor was wonderful though, and I would suggest that this recipe serves no more than 2 people in a realistic situation. Thanks for sharing! ~Sue"
323186,222479,2008-10-15,5,"Very nice, and we were quite happy with the amount of vinegar, it added a nice tang that I really enjoyed. 
  I used fresh beans, and I think I had a bit too much bacon... but we like bacon!  
Easy to prepare, a lovely way to prepare a favourite vegetable!

Thanks, diner!"
157167,222479,2009-05-25,5,"Delicious!  I added a small diced potato just because it sounded good to me :-)  I also love making fresh green beans this way, with some extra bacon."
88099,222479,2009-09-30,5,"Excellent.  I've never used the vinegar in my green beans and really like the additional flavor.  This went very well with roast beef, potatoes and carrots.  Thanks for sharing.  :)"
126032,67916,2005-05-04,5,I love this!  When avocados are in season I eat this constantly for breakfast.  I like to butter my toast and add a little salt as well.
99227,67916,2005-05-15,0,"This is one of my all-time favourite snacks!  As odd as it sounds, I like to spread a little cream cheese on the toast before the avocado."
252527,67916,2005-11-03,0,this is also very nice with either a drizzle of sweet chilli saucea or a thin smear of vegemite
108902,67916,2007-03-20,5,I wasn't about to try this until a friend made me and it is so good! I just add salt and pepper and I'm in heaven. Now I need more avocados!
143133,67916,2007-07-04,5,I also ADORE this with a bit of sprinkle of garlic salt. YUM!
651118,67916,2008-07-24,5,I love this! My mom always made this for me when I was little. Fabulous and simple!
122878,67916,2008-10-22,5,"What's not to love?  These make for the best sandwiches ever.  I do spread mayonnaise on the toast and add salt and pepper.  Just outstanding!  These are also great with a big slice of ripe tomato on top of the avocado, YUM!  Thanks for the great idea Boje."
576428,201798,2007-09-16,5,This recipe is a great quick fix and is perfect for fall occasions. Love it!
242766,201798,2007-09-28,5,"*Made for fall PAC 2007*

Delicious! This cake goes together quickly and is full of wonderful flavor. My family loved this, of course they love my recipe #143108 recipe which this is very similar to. I used Golden Delicious apples, my preferred apple for baking. A definite keeper...thanks for sharing!"
270514,201798,2007-09-28,4,"This cake had really great flavor and was super easy to put together.  The only thing I would advise is not to put it in a bundt pan.  It completely collapsed, but that didn't stop us from eating it with our fingers."
143001,201798,2009-05-07,4,"The flavor of this cake was terrific.   However, it did not look like a cake.  The top was so crusty that if I tried to cut it,  the crust shattered, however it tasted good.  The bottom seemed more like a thick  bread pudding rather than a cake,  but was also delicious.  Actually the 2 different textures is part of what made it taste good, so we'll make this again and see how it turns out."
1366254,201798,2009-11-27,4,Good stuff!
328909,201798,2009-12-24,5,This is a family favorite.  I am glad the recipe is here so I don't lose it.  It s great served with whipped cream or Cool whip.
2043832,201798,2011-10-25,5,"This is a family favorite!  I make it every year we visit Apple Hill.  I like to use a mix of Romes, Fujis, and Galas.  I also go with 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar.  This cake's so good, my vegan daughter will cheat for a taste."
1363049,201798,2013-11-19,5,"I visited Apple Hill last month and brought home several different types of apples. I found this recipe on the back of a plastic bag holding 5 LBS of Braeburn apples. I made this yesterday for a Baptism  celebration at a friends house. Everyone loved this delicious cake. I was hearing a lot of mmm&#039;s and yums! I made a few changes to the recipe . I used a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar. I also sifted my flour. I used a variety of braeburns, Fuji&#039;s and a variety that they sell at Apple Hill called Arkansas Black which is a crisp sweet and tart apple delish! I think by using the brown sugar it gave this cake a sticky gooey texture. Next time I will use all white sugar to compare. I made my cake in 2 round pans but I will use one round pan next time. I also made a Maple glaze that I drizzled in the middle of the cake. This recipe is so simple with outstanding results. Thanks for posting the recipe."
2001244974,201798,2016-11-13,0,"This recipe was given to me 40 some years ago. Misplaced it and found it on my PC from Apple Hill. So thrilled, as it has been my go to and very favorite fall desert.Thank you Apple Hill."
980739,214165,2011-03-14,5,"So simple and delicious! Loved the combination of thyme, olive oil, salt, and freshly cracked pepper. The asparagus themselves came out crisp, and the family loved this. Thanks!"
45727,214165,2007-03-21,4,Very Good.  This was my first time making Asparagus.  It was easy and we enjoyed it very much.
454460,214165,2007-04-14,5,Thank you for such a simple recipe.  It was absoutely delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  This is definitely a keeper!
124876,214165,2007-04-25,4,"So quick and simple. Cooking for just myself, it's hard to buy a prebundled bunch of asparagus and eat it all in one sitting. In the past I used to steam the spears but the left overs were soggy. Roasting them keeps them crispy and even the refrigerated leftovers are good. This is a very practical recipe that tastes great!"
314983,214165,2007-05-19,5,So simple and taste great too.  I didn't change a thing.
402698,214165,2007-06-17,5,Perfect!!  I had only dried ground thyme and it worked wonderfully.  Thanks!
171790,214165,2007-06-18,5,"Excellent. Both my DD and her friend liked it, too."
61660,214165,2007-06-19,4,Really nice way to prepare asparagus!  I used fresh thyme and a little extra pepper!  Thanks!
222478,214165,2007-06-20,5,Great way to cook fresh asparagus! I only had dried thyme but it still came out great.
591823,214165,2007-09-19,4,"When I tried this recipe, I cooked mine for 20 mins, to give it a crispier taste, but I thought they were delicious!"
580030,214165,2007-10-16,5,I really liked this recipe.  Very simple to make and delicious!
592131,214165,2008-01-04,5,I always screw up my asparagus and somehow boil it to mush. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. The asparagus came out perfect!
15417,214165,2008-01-07,4,"Quick, delicious, and healty."
326420,214165,2008-01-22,5,"Simply excellent. Was looking for something different to do with asparagus, and decided to give it a try. It came out a little crispy and it was delicious - didn't have fresh thyme, so I used basil instead and it was great. Will make this again for sure. Thanks for sharing a great recipe Melody."
632249,214165,2008-02-08,5,This is delicious!
784164,214165,2008-03-13,5,"So easy to make, and sooooo delicious!  I'll be making this often."
335154,214165,2008-03-18,5,This is awesome side dish !  I did not measure just dizzled the olive oil and sprinkled the spices and roasted for the 15 min .  Very tasty indeed ! Thanks
4470,214165,2008-03-21,5,"The oven temperature & timing are perfect - The asparagus still had some crunch and had a nice texture. The thyme seems to bring out the asparagus flavor and does not intrude on it!  Thanks for a lovely simple tasty side dish Melody

Made it again and enjoyed it just as much - Cut the recipe back to 2 servings with no problem  Thanks again"
168069,214165,2008-03-22,5,"I used dried oregano and this recipe was FANTASTIC!!!  
I also prepared button mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, brussel sprouts, zucchini slices, fresh green beans and fingerling potatoes in the same way at the same time (giving the potatoes just a bit longer to cook.)  Everything was just delicious."
26719,214165,2008-03-23,5,"These were great with our Easter Dinner - Ham, StellaMae's Southern Scalloped Potatoes (Recipe #60160) and DannyGirl's Maple Glazed Carrots (Recipe #7809).  

I bought some fresh dill the other day and added some of that instead of thyme.  I put the asparagus, oil, salt and dill in a ziploc to coat and roasted about 15 minutes at 425.  They turned out great for not being prime asparagus season.   I can't wait to make this again when asparagus is at its prime."
633318,214165,2008-03-25,5,Loved it!  The whole family are asparagus eaters now!  Thanks.
169906,214165,2008-03-29,5,"This is a very good recipe.  My aunt made this recipe with a lot of different veggies and everything was great.  

The veggies cooked like this are great if you also make jumbo shrimp with the shells cut in the same way.

Thank you for posting this recipe."
418423,214165,2008-04-03,0,Just made this for lunch...was so delicious...my husband loved the olive oil flavor!  Thanks for sharing!
184633,214165,2008-04-06,5,Our asparagus turned out perfect with this recipe. Thank you!
67835,214165,2008-04-17,5,"We really loved your Aunt Ely's recipe, litldarlin.  Thanks for sharing it!  I  added a bit of garlic powder and right before serving sprinkled some Parmesan cheese over the top.  The asparagus was the ""fatter"" size, so baked 20 minutes.  Can't wait to make your delicious recipe again!  M. Joan"
678857,214165,2008-05-24,5,Enjoyed your asparagus recipe - used fresh asparagus we bought at the farmer's market this morning.  Baked just a little longer than 15 minutes since the asparagus was quite thick.  Delicious and easy.  Thanks for posting.
189579,214165,2008-06-28,5,"So simple and great. I was skeptic about putting it into the oven without boiling first, but it came out just great! Thanks!"
815198,214165,2008-09-15,5,"This is a great Asparagus recipe, even my husband like it!! I made two small changes when I made mine, instead of drizzling with olive oil I used an oil mister and I also added a little Parmesan cheese right at the end. It was a very easy recipe and it turned out perfect. Thanks for posting!!"
66246,214165,2008-09-19,5,For some reason I can't seem to cook asparagus properly until now.  I follow the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  I served it alongside Maple Ginger Salmon and wild rice.  Thank you for helping make the meal complete.  Next time I make it I will try adding a little Parmesan cheese like another reviewer did and see how it tastes.
736607,214165,2008-10-27,5,"Tell your Aunt to keep on sharing those recipes, because this is delicious.  I made this at Easter when the asparagus is SO tender and SO good.  Then, today in the grocery store, saw the last of the season's asparagus on sale, and had to bite!  This is the third time I have made this recipe, and other than grilling our asparagus in the summer, is the only other way I will prepare it. Thanks for sharing! Viclynn"
58892,214165,2008-10-28,5,This is the only way I cook asparagus - quick and easy. It's also easy to dress up with various cheeses or dressings after cooking.
470351,214165,2008-10-29,5,"REALLY good!  I wasn't expecting much out of this because I'm used to adding garlic, or balsamic vinegar or feta to my asparagus...but this was SUPER good!  Even my husband (who never usually compliments my vegetables) said this was super yummy.  The flavors blended really well together and the thyme added such a nice flavor to the dish.  I really enjoyed this one.  Thank you."
1072595,214165,2008-12-13,5,"This recipe is delicious! I have never been much of an asparagus person, but I couldn't get enough of this!"
743849,214165,2009-02-11,5,"This is EXCELLENT!  I followed the recipe as directed (except I halved it) and it was some of the best asparagus I've ever eaten.  So delicious, so easy...  I'm planning on making this often.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
164610,214165,2009-02-12,5,"5 stars from both me and bf.  This was simple, quick, tasty.  Bf said this was yummy.  I think I preferred this to steaming.  I used dried thyme and didn't really measure.  Thanks for sharing, I will make this as often as I can. :)"
66448,214165,2009-02-12,5,"Very good! Much better than bland steamed asparagus. The thyme gave it a nice flavor. Will be making it like this from now on, thanks for a 5* recipe!"
157167,214165,2009-02-16,0,"I really prefer steamed asparagus.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my asparagus was mushy instead of crisp like I was expecting.  It was simpler to make though."
1175362,214165,2009-02-21,5,Absolutely perfect!  I loved this recipe because it was so easy to get right without any fuss!  A wonderful and special way to make asparagus special but belyingly easy!  Made the recipe exactly as specified and it was just right.
1210961,214165,2009-03-21,5,"Wow, great and so easy!  Texture came out perfect.  I will be using this recipe regularly and may try other herbs for variety."
353131,214165,2009-03-23,5,"This is an awesome way to fix asparagus. Even my 11,10 and 8 y/o kids ate it. Made it with quick hollandaise sauce!"
369715,214165,2009-03-23,5,Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written and the asparagus came out perfect. Made for Spring PAC 2009.
881774,214165,2009-04-03,5,This was awesome.  We love asparagus but  get tired of it just steamed.
569248,214165,2009-04-09,5,"Great way to eat asparagus!  My husband that normally does not care for it- LOVED it!  In the future when I am using the dried thyme, I would use a bit less 1-1.5t."
390859,214165,2011-03-26,5,So good and easy.   Thanks for the great recipe.
458442,214165,2009-04-10,3,"I had some leftover asparagus from making something else, and I didn't want it to go to waste, so I tried this recipe.  It wasn't bad...but I really felt it was bland.   I think I would have preferred to use more spice, actually.  Might try this again, though, with more spice like I mentioned.  I did like how crunchy the tops were, but the rest seemed kinda mushy.  I followed the cooking time on the recipe, but perhaps I should have left them in a bit longer."
443912,214165,2009-05-23,5,This is the fastest asparagus recipe I have ever had.  Very hands off.  The asparagus is outstanding.  My family loves it and we have found a new way to cook asparagus.
705423,214165,2009-06-07,5,"Thanks for making me an asparagus lover! :)  I didn't have any thyme so I used some kosher salt, McCormick Garlic Pepper blend and I also used balsamic vinegar with the olive oil.  It was fabulous!"
1297989,214165,2009-06-16,2,"It's just OK, needs something extra.  Maybe rosemary or some garlic butter brushed on it."
134624,214165,2009-07-11,4,"I was looking for a different way to prepare asparagus, and found this. I thought 2 Tbs of oil was just a wee bit too much, but that's just a personal preference. We ended up putting these on the grill since hubby already had it fired up for some chicken, took less than 5 minutes to grill them, and they came out nice and roasty toasty.
Will probably do this again, and experiment with different flavors. I like the suggestion of oregano (love oregano)."
1363049,214165,2009-09-01,5,This was really good. I even got my finicky 7 yr. old to eat these. My husband liked them as well and wants me to make more often. I usually use butter but this much healthier way to eat. I also tried this method with fresh green beans and they also tasted very good. Thanks for sharing this healthy recipe  =)
1390872,214165,2009-10-02,5,Great Simple Recipe.  Loved it.
648514,214165,2009-10-23,5,I would change nothing!  My husband grew up in a home where they didn't eat veggies.  So he loves when I go on Recipezaar and find yummy recipes that make veggies fun and delicious!  Thanks for posting !
1398976,214165,2009-11-05,5,I made this the other night and it was great! I hate putting anything in the microwave and steaming veggies always seems like such a hassle. I added a little bit of garlic powder to the aspargaus and they came out just right. Thank you!
108043,214165,2009-11-09,5,"I have always liked asparagus, but love asparagus now!!!  This simple easy recipe is outstanding.  I love the thyme on it.  Putting it in the oven while finishing dinner cannot be simpler.  The only problem was that I was the only one having it so I did not cook a lot - I wish I had as I wanted more!!!!!  You really have to try this recipe as you won't be sorry.  Just make lots as you will make this your main course!!!  Thanks for sharing."
1450088,214165,2009-11-26,4,Yummy and delight full but i would also recomend some soy sauce and garlic salt for zest:)
630336,214165,2009-11-29,5,Yummmmmmmy!
1457659,214165,2010-01-05,5,"Perfect...added to my Asparagus Spring Rolls and used Marjoram instead of Thyme.  This was delightful and will definately be added to the ""Keeper"" file.  Thx for sharing."
460301,214165,2010-01-06,5,so good and easy :)
497948,214165,2010-02-15,5,I made these last night. They came out perfect. Crunchy and flavorful!
93911,214165,2010-03-02,5,"Perfectly cooked, a little bit of crispness.  Always looking for an excuse to use my fresh thyme."
268272,214165,2010-03-10,5,"Fantastic, simple & delicious!  Nevertheless, I cheated and used my microwave and it was still 'da bomb.  Thank you for sharing!"
168612,214165,2010-03-17,5,"This is a wonderful recipe! I was never a big asparagus eater, but tried it this way and LOVE IT. My kids loved it so much, they beg for asparagus now...even got my picky husband begging for more! Thanks for a great way to prepare this, I hate mushy veggies and these came out crispy and TASTY! Thanks again!"
305531,214165,2010-03-28,5,"Yum! This is fast, easy, and tasty. A great way to fix asparagus. Thanks litldarlin for a nice treat. Made for Cookbook Tag."
807941,214165,2010-04-05,5,"Yummy.  At Easter Brunch this was the first item to disappear.  I did have to cook mine a little longer (about 20 minutes), and I added more olive oil."
6258,214165,2010-04-21,4,"A great dish!  I especially love roasting it in the oven.  I made this as directed, except I used spray olive oil.  I liked the flavor of the thyme and the asparagus.  A nice combination.  Thanks for sharing your family recipe.  It's a keeper for sure!"
1426364,214165,2010-06-22,4,"The taste was nice, but I discovered that I do not like fresh asparagus, mine were so stringy!!"
578914,214165,2010-10-22,5,This was great. We did 13 mins in a toaster oven. Will use again - thank you!
623817,214165,2011-02-14,5,"Simple, and just about perfect!"
877892,214165,2011-03-02,5,"Like my daughter said, ""I hate asparagus and this tastes great"".  A winner in my house and the only way I'll be cooking asparagus from now on, at least when my daughter visits. Thanks so much for posting, we all really liked this."
1072593,214165,2011-06-21,5,I can see it.  Another recipe just itching for another review.  Couldn't get enough and I think I should send you flowers or something.
140132,214165,2011-06-27,5,Great recipe.  I loved the thyme addition to these.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.
1253700,214165,2011-08-27,5,"It's so quick, simple and tasty, I love it. I use fresh thyme which makes the dish taste more alive. (I bought fresh thyme from the farmers market and propagated it-stuck some sprigs in soil-and it just keeps on growing!) yum yum"
233583,214165,2012-02-29,5,"litldarlin you tell Aunt Elly this will be a go to for my family as well.  This was the perfect side to go with our Sunday ham dinner.  After pulling the ham out I increased the oven and slid the asparagus in. It was done to perfection for the dinner table in perfect timing.  By the time the potatoes were smashed and the ham was cut I was able to put these tasty morsels on the table sizzling hot. It was pantry painting day for DH and BIL so the meal was apropos.  Served with  #113483 By AngelaTN and #75396 By Jellyqueen .   I am using the bone and some leftovers to make 15 bean soup today, #471093 By ratherbeswimmin"
50969,214165,2014-04-03,4,"I made this recipe as part of mine and my SO&#039;s dinner on 3/30/14.And since it was just the two of us, the recipe was reduced by half and it worked perfectly. This would be an easy and perfect recipe for a beginner cook to follow. Thank you for posting and &quot; Keep Smiling :) &quot;"
198154,214165,2016-09-11,4,I had to use dried thyme because we didn't have any fresh on hand. Still tasted great! It was quick and easy to throw together. I served it with grilled salmon and a five grain Italian bread with an olive oil dipping sauce. An easy and delicious meal!
63291,214165,2018-04-06,5,This was really good. Very quick and easy to put together. Left out the thyme as I didn't have any but added 1-1/2 tsp of chopped garlic. This is the first time I've had asparagus cooked this way but it definitely won't be the last. Served it with a ham steak and baked potato.
220403,103138,2007-04-18,5,"Very nice sloppy joe!  I especially liked being able to just throw in everything together and cook it up.  I'm also very happy because I've been trying to figure out how to get a fine ""grain"" to my sloppy joe & taco meat texture, and this is finally it!  :)  Evidently mixing up other ingredients in with the ground beef before cooking breaks it down & makes it tender with small ""crumbles""!  Thank you, BJTAILLIGHTS!!"
451700,65732,2008-07-14,4,"I thought this is a lovely way to serve onions, but DH wasn't too keen. I used just 2 onions and 1 bouillon cube cut into two. I loved the sweetness of the onion with the garlicky and slightly salty juice in the foil. DH said next time he would open up the foil for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time to crisp it up a bit. Thank you, Susang, for sharing this wonderful recipe! :)"
1968337,65732,2011-09-16,5,wonderful idea going to try this way soon Thanks.Ken
69838,130992,2006-01-04,4,"The texture of my jam was a bit different, maybe due to my lack of experience with this sort of thing, but the flavor was out of this world.  I cut the recipe down to make just one jar, so I could put it in a container and use it up in a short period of time (I dont know how to can/jar anything!!! lol).  Thanks for this recipe.  It was fabulous on english muffins :)"
323411,130992,2006-07-04,5,"Delicious jam, very sweet but dissapeared very quickly in my house.Will make again."
67403,130992,2007-07-20,5,We usually hate apple jam but we sure love this one! Thanks so much for a great recipe....I have 4 apple trees and really am grateful we will use the fruit now! I really like the sweet taste of the banana in it!
138429,130992,2008-04-04,5,"Love this jam on bagels,yum. Great way to use up the last of the apples and bananas, not that I will be waiting to use up the last of the bananas and apples before I make  this jam  again..  I found it a bit sweet (personal taste) but will try cutting  the sugar back just a bit. I used a softer apple  and that worked perfect. The jam is  a nice consistency. Great recipe! (recipe swap #15)"
910190,130992,2009-08-15,5,"This was great with pancakes! I used 250g less sugar and it was still very sweet! Lovely, worth a try! Thanks"
655199,422394,2010-05-03,2,"This was quite easy to make, but we really didn't really care for it. Thanks for sharing, though."
209983,151871,2006-02-23,5,"This was an excellent recipe!!!  I couldn;'t find rice wine vinegar so I sub 1/8 c white wine vinegar and 1/8 c rice vinegar.  I cooked this on my farberware indoor grill instead of baking.  VERY yummy!!!  The sauce/Marinade is fabulous!!! 
Thanks for another winner"
49304,151871,2006-03-02,5,"Delicious recipe, I made it using country style ribs and chicken thighs. Made them just as the recipe stated,but baking them in the oven, this worked great. Sprinkled them with sesame seeds about 10 minutes before removing them from the oven. DH loved this recipe which I will be making again soon, he especially liked the chicken. Thanks Kitten, for posting this recipe."
141293,151871,2006-03-12,5,"Wonderful flavor!  I halved the recipe and used 2# of boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Marinated for 24 hours and poured the whole thing into a baking dish and baked covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 10.  Served with Kitten's Easy Sesame Cashew Noodles #156677."
317368,151871,2006-05-11,4,This turned out to be very flavorful and preparation was relatively simple. We enjoyed it.
502302,151871,2008-09-23,5,Excellent! I'm realizing that I'm a big fan of the sweet/salty tastes. We made this with the pork ribs but I will have to try it with other cuts as well. Only thing I did was leave out the pepper.
358698,151871,2009-09-24,5,"These are terrific.  My DS loves these and asks for them all the time.  Really easy.  Only change was that I baked them slowly at 250 for about 2 hours, then finished on the grill and brushed on the sauce several times.  Next time I will make some extra sauce on the stove for dipping.  Going in the keeper file.  THANKS!"
369386,249034,2007-09-20,5,This was a good snack. I just love celery and it was fun to eat ants!
486648,249034,2009-09-13,5,"We used to eat these growing up, it was my favorite way to eat celery. Sometimes my mom subbed in peanut butter for the cream cheese, and that was pretty good, too!!"
407007,249034,2009-10-19,5,"Yum, yum, yum. I'm a teacher and I loved this in my lunchbox today. I used garden vegetable cream cheese and omitted the raisins, but it still was a tasty snack. I've had celery with peanut butter before but never cream cheese - great idea! Thanks for sharing."
227607,249034,2011-09-14,5,I made up a batch of these for school lunch boxes.  They are very good!  We like these better than the ones with the peanut butter.
178362,113860,2005-08-24,5,"I made this for a church pot luck and had many positive comments.  I did not have garlic powder so used minced garlic and it was great.  Thanks Gwynn!
"
60486,113860,2008-08-13,5,"Wonderful! Definite winner and will make again. Sliced the bacon into pcs ranging from 1/2"" to 1"" and then pan-fried, which I did the day before for easy assembling the next day. Next time will cook just a tad more as it softens up a bit after mixed with the salad. Used a bit more milk to thin out the dressing, also didn't add all the dressing to the salad, this way people who wanted more could add more, though no one did. Used a vegetable seasoning mix instead of garlic powder. Tossed most of the items together, while reserving a few sliced grape tomatoes, bacon, croutons to place on top for aesthetic purposes at serving. Had requests to make this again next weekend, and I'm more than happy to comply.

This is also the same as recipe #115388 , # 115388"
173314,113860,2008-09-09,5,Delicious!  loved it dressing was great and could eat  this everyday...thanks.
689540,113860,2009-02-18,5,I made it with Romaine and left out the croutons for a little lower carb salad and I loved it.  The dressing is very nice too!
5975680,397584,2014-02-23,5,Awesome recipe!!!  I have tried half dozen banana recipes and this is the best one&lt;br/&gt;that has worked for me!  Love that fact that it is easy and you put batter in oven and it heats up as it goes!  Is very moist and it does not last long in the house!  :-)
207176,218022,2008-12-03,5,Very moist and good!  I have a lot of walnuts to use up and I had 3 very dark bananas so that's what interested me about the recipe. I had all the ingredients (unlike the buttermilk recipes) so I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did.  I used Splenda for the sugar and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Thanks!
133564,163506,2009-04-01,5,"This was ordered by our girls-nt-out group at a wine bar ~ I thought it sounded strange...until I tasted it!  Amazing mix of flavors!  Our asparagus was roasted with OOil & garlic, then the asparagus and egg were topped with parmesan ~ yummmmm!"
1194253,163506,2010-11-09,5,"I cooked the asparagus with green onions, mushrooms, wine, and olive oil.  I over cooked the egg but it was still very soft inside even though I didn't peel it very well.  My family said they weren't so sure about it but they cleaned their plates.  It doesn't sound like it would be good but we loved it!  I don't want asparagus any other way now.  Thanks for posting!"
223616,346324,2012-05-30,5,This is so good! I've been making it for years. I sometimes use half mozzarella and half swiss cheese. Must like salmon
2215753,346324,2012-08-20,5,Please add stars to my review.
2510228,75286,2012-11-18,0,The sugar is DEFINITELY wrong... these taste like pancakes when you make them as is... you need 1 1/2- 2 cups of sugar. Its best if you do 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar! I made them this alternative way and they were great!
115321,75286,2003-12-11,5,"I love these cookies! I made these with my two year old daughter (our first baking session). Unfortunately, I realized too late I was out of oil so had to use butter, so can't review the recipe as written, but with butter they are really tasty! They are soft cookies and not overly sweet. Very good! Thanks!"
18391,75286,2004-01-27,4,"I made these with oil, and they are good .. I like the ones made with butter more, and I would add a bit more sugar to the dough .. thanks, this recipe is excellent if you want cookies but have no butter on hand!"
446767,75286,2013-02-03,5,an amazing recipe worked wonders on my family although i didnt have vanilla in them so i cant give100% opinion
137302,486453,2012-10-06,5,"Very good!  Light, moist, the right amount of sweetness...and just plain delicious!"
2589997,486453,2012-12-25,5,I followed the recipe with one exception.  I used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar.  The muffins were amazing!  I highly recommend this recipe.
369715,486453,2013-01-09,5,OMG these were so good. I followed the recipe as written other then I too used Splenda Brown Sugar as that is all I buy. I got 12 muffins. Everyone loved them. We enjoyed them warm and after they cooled.
2658453,486453,2013-01-26,0,This recipe was awesome!!! They came out very good! My kids just loved them!!! And they are not banana lovers.
2745597,486453,2013-03-20,0,Made this recipe today follow as written and they came out very moist and I got 16 muffins out of the...
2797945,486453,2013-04-23,5,"I just tried this recipe and I had to make a few changes since I&#039;m gluten-free. I added one more banana and egg, I used my gluten-free flour and I also added some cinnamon too it. They are amazing!!"
2822249,486453,2013-05-11,5,So simple to make and absolutely delicious!!!  Will make again and again!
2836416,486453,2013-05-23,5,"The perfect banana muffins!  I did add one extra banana so not to have to throw it away and I used whole wheat flour. Also, I filled my silicone muffin pans all the way to the brim and topped them off with shredded coconut. Delish!  My kids devoured them.  Easy-Peasy!!!"
6240791,486453,2013-09-29,0,"These came out great! Easy recipe! I added some vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon,  and chocolate chip and peanut butter morsels."
1802637368,486453,2014-04-02,4,"These have amazing texture and moistness.  I have been using the recipe from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook...you know...the classic red checked cookbook everyone gets as a gift when they get married?  They always tasted ok, but had the texture of softballs.  So I went online to find a better recipe.  Somehow, of the hundreds of banana bread/muffin recipes out there, I found this one right away, tried it, and just made it a second time today.  It will be my go-to recipe to use up over-ripe bananas.  They are like CRACK!  One reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is missing a primary ingredient for baked goods - vanilla.  Add one tsp of vanilla to your egg and banana mixture before mixing that with the flour mixture.  It will make them 5 star.  Also I love to add a hand full of mini-chocolate chips.  I swear you&#039;ll eat the whole batch in a couple days.  They are amazing."
1800039535,486453,2014-04-20,0,"I&#039;ve used this recipe a half dozen times now. I sometimes add a few tablespoons of oats, flox seeds, and always a couple handfuls of nuts!"
1802796166,486453,2014-06-04,4,Really easy to make and delicious!!
949483,486453,2014-06-19,5,"Outstanding! Quick and easy to make, you will always have most ingredients on hand. As a professional chef I only added a little vanilla to enhance the banana flavor - not a lot just a few drops. I also used 4 well ripened bananas I like to wait until the bananas are close to being  black, trust me you will get the best banana flavor when you ripen them this way. To get the nice dome you must fill the cupcake paper to the top."
1802881529,486453,2014-07-03,5,"So easy to put together yet it comes out so moist and delicious!!!!! I do recommended adding the (1 teaspoon or vanilla extract) even if the banana is ripe. Perfect taste, not overly sweet !"
2000119635,486453,2015-04-05,4,I made this today &amp; they came out great I just added a splash of vanilla exact &amp; they came out great ?.
2000120720,486453,2015-04-06,5,"I found this recipe and loved it! I add a few things after the first time I made it to my taste and they are now a family favorite. I substitute about a fourth of the amount of brown sugar for powder sugar, it helps keep them moist and fluffy, I added a dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla to bring out the banana flavor. Also adding a pan of water in the oven with the muffins makes them wonderfully soft. So happy I ran across this recipe out of the thousands online."
2000223571,486453,2015-05-24,4,"These were really good and super simple to make. I modified the recipe slightly, adding a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon."
2000230555,486453,2015-07-01,5,"Very good recipe! I did add vanilla, chia seeds and wheat germ to the recipe! Oh and a shake of cinnamon! But nice flavor without the sugar!"
2000319042,486453,2015-07-05,5,"I tried making this recipe for the first time and it came out wonderfully. I added 1 TSP of vanilla and walnuts, but didn&#039;t change/add anything else. I filled up the cups almost all the way and they got a really nice dome-shape on top. Moist and delicious; this will be my go-to recipe for banana nut muffins going forward?"
2000523328,486453,2015-10-04,5,"Truly excellent recipe. I added an extra egg (high altitude), 1 C dark chocolate chips and vanilla. I used four really black bananas. These are moist and delicious"
2000553034,486453,2015-10-12,5,"I didn&#039;t spray the baking cups and am regretting that because they&#039;re really sticking to the paper liners, but other than that they&#039;re fantastic! I too also added vanilla, chopped walnuts, and some mini chocolate morsels.  Outstanding!"
2000660674,486453,2015-11-09,5,Oh my these are so good! Soft and moist and such a simple recipe. I added some cinnamon to the mix and topped with cinnamon and sugar.
487124,486453,2016-02-14,3,"I found the nutrition facts confusing.  It says &quot;serving size 1&quot; which sounds like facts stated are for WHOLE recipe.  Does this mean I can divide by the number of muffins I make to determine the nutrition info for one muffin? Recipe sounds delicious, but my husband has to be very careful of his diet, so I&#039;m a bit hesitant to make this."
2001341488,486453,2017-01-07,5,Quick easy and delicious
2001383335,486453,2017-02-08,5,"I happen to come across this recipe a few weeks ago &amp; decided to try it, but replaced the regular flour with an all-purpose Gluten Free flour(because my daughter has Celiac disease). And anyone who has ever made GF muffins or baked goods knows it can come out very dry or too dense. But between this recipe &amp; the particular brand GF flour I used to make the muffins, it was phenomenal! Not too dense &amp; super, super moist! Now instead of regular sized muffins, I made mini muffins so they'd appeal more to a 6 yr old. They were a huge hit...especially with my daughters friends. They never eat GF anything and they never suspected a thing-to them it was just the best muffin they had ever ate. They were asking for third &amp; fourth helpings, and asking me to give the recipe to their mothers! So if this recipe tastes this awesome GF...I can only imagine how delicious they are with all that yummy gluten! Seriously... great recipe! And I am not one to write reviews very often...only when a recipe is so unbelievably good that I feel it is my duty to not only let the world know, but more importantly, to thank the chef for being kind enough to share it &amp; not keep it a secret :-))"
2001403726,486453,2017-02-23,5,I'm severely allergic to bananas but I made these for family today. They all raved about them!!
2001417659,486453,2017-03-05,5,Delicious.
2001051615,486453,2017-03-20,5,"Because my kids like everything with chocolate, I added 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. But with or with the chocolate chips, the muffins were perfect and a great snack for their school lunches. This really is the the muffin recipe I've been searching for."
2001467838,486453,2017-04-02,5,"This is a great basic recipe. My muffins turned out perfect. I doubled the recipe, added about a teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/2 cup of pecans for a little texture. Yumm;)"
2001593485,486453,2017-06-21,0,Great
2001648269,486453,2017-07-29,4,Decent recipe could use a little bit more flavor added maybe some chocolate chips or blueberries
2001651208,486453,2017-07-31,0,Is it half a cuo if butter or one stick because one stick is 1/4 of a cup.
2001678502,486453,2017-08-19,5,Delicious.
2001706759,486453,2017-09-09,5,"Thank you for this recipe; it was pretty easy and quick to bake/make. My only changes were adding vanilla and walnuts. At first bite, my husband said this recipe should be 6 (not 5) stars and that he would pay $100 for the muffin. LOL. He also asked me to save the recipe, so it was quite clear that he loved it. Thank you again!"
2001798254,486453,2017-11-15,5,Amazing! They were so moist and fluffy. I love them. I will be making them again.
2001799627,486453,2017-11-16,5,"Delicious! Made them last week with some variations(1 cup AP,1 cup wheat flour, vanilla essence, chocolate chips, baking time 25 mins) they came out yummy. Will be making again, today :)"
2001831742,486453,2017-11-30,5,"Quick, easy recipe. Turned out great. Plan on &quot;tweaking&quot; this with chocolate chips next time!"
2001915122,486453,2018-01-06,5,"Delicious! An awesome recipe, no frills and super tasty!"
2001925491,486453,2018-01-11,3,I found they came out pretty dry and lacking flavor.
2001936444,486453,2018-01-16,2,"Always read a recipe before making it... Did anyone beside me noticed the lack of spices? Such as cinnamon, all spice and nutmeg? I changed the recipe adding those and shortening instead of butter because it's all I had and 1 tps of magic powder is needed for next batch."
2001940095,486453,2018-01-18,5,
2001998874,486453,2018-02-18,5,All I can say is DELICIOUS! My family absolutely loved these muffins.
2000617713,486453,2018-04-08,5,Loved it. So soft and moist from the inside and crisp from the outside. I used the pampered chec brown paper non stick liners. I also substituted one banana for one ripe soft pear. And i added a little more brown sugar. I put in chocolate chips and crushed walnuts broken into bits.
2002119981,486453,2018-04-18,5,These came out so tasty- the recipe is really easy to follow and they come out nice and fluffy. I did add some pecan bits because I like them in my banana muffins.
738401,20140,2008-02-02,5,"I love this recipe.  This is the ONLY garlic bread that I make now.  Simple and fantastic.  I printed it out last summer and have been using it ever since.  I've served it for company and it goes fast.  I love the rich, salty taste.  So does my husband and everyone I've served it to.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
392739,122750,2007-04-30,5,"This one of my PAC choices and here is my review
1. Very easy to make
2. Very good w/chips and Tortilla chips
3. It is a keeper
great to have at parties or just sitting around munchin why you watch tv."
531310,122750,2010-07-04,5,"This is an awesome dip, very addicting!  I added green onions to mine.  Yummy!"
17803,171829,2006-08-19,4,"This was very easy to make, I used fresh peaches to make ours.  It tastes wonderful warm out of the oven.  I used plastic wrap to press the cake mixture into the pan.  The sour cream mixture does not drizzle well, so mine were more like big drops here and there.  But weather drizzled or drops it was good eating!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Made for Zaar Tag 2006 "
585211,125915,2009-06-27,4,This is a very easy cookie recipe.  I used 1 stick of butter instead of shortening.  My children love these cookies (5 stars).  I have to hide them or they will be eaten in no time. I like them but think they are 4 stars.  thanks for posting!
107135,125915,2010-02-21,5,from bulah miller sally likes this recipe thanks for posting
296809,284415,2008-04-11,5,"DH & I chg roles when it comes to frosting. I am usually the more adventurous one, but usually like cookies plain or lightly dusted w/powd sugar. He is usually the purist, but likes cookies frosted to satisfy his huge sweet-tooth. So he was the judge here & cannot keep his hands off these cookies! I admit I do like the hint of lemony goodness that is there but not strong. I used this icing to frost your Recipe #284530. Made for Spring PAC 2008 & thx for sharing your recipe w/us."
485109,284415,2009-12-12,5,Great basic frosting and very versatile. I also loved the hint of lemon shining out through the sweetness. Thanks Ceezie!
163112,143323,2014-09-08,5,YUM!  I did everything as I was told &amp; it was fabulous &amp; now it&#039;s gone!  I even found &#039;Northwestern Bartlett&#039; pears!!  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ.  :)
226867,143323,2014-09-10,5,"Excellent! I hesitated about the kohlrabi, but it added a lovely crunch and a special nuance of flavor. Made for CCQ Culinary Quest 2014"
233492,132617,2006-05-27,0,well I am getting ready to try it.  Don't know the degrees so will try 400 ...wonder if the microwave would work?  that would be super...and I will use dill weed...its dandy
212417,132617,2006-08-20,5,"This was sooooo good!! I am a huge ""garlic head""...I love the stuff, esp. roasted garlic!! The addition of thyme (which is what I used) added to the flavor perfectly!! I spread some on grilled bread with tomatoes and cheese - Yumm-o!! Thank you for this keeper!!"
130663,132617,2007-05-26,5,Tasty and nice and creamy
286661,132617,2007-10-13,5,Thank your for posting this.
486725,132617,2010-05-17,5,"Yum! I baked the garlic at 375 tightly wrapped in foil. It was done at the 45 minute mark when I unwrapped it, so I didn't continue cooking it after that. Roasted garlic is the best!"
2143309,415810,2012-01-11,5,This recipe is awesome!! It doesn't separate like other alfredo sauces I've made. I whisked the flour into the cream before I added it to the hot butter & cream cheese. I also added a little garlic powder. This will be my go-to Alfredo from now on!
37449,114963,2005-04-03,5,"The brownies were great! I used 3 oz. unsweetened, 2 semi sweet, because that is what I had. I used 1 2/3 cups sugar to compensate. I agree with Julie-Do not overcook! I let it cook just a little too long-they were good, just not as fudgy as they should have been! Thanks for a great recipe Julie!"
89831,114963,2005-04-08,5,"Excellent brownies Julie! I made them yesterday to give to my son. I did add in some tiny chocolate chips and nuts, and baked them in a 8-inch glass baking pan. In my air-bake convection oven they only too 32 minutes to bake (I was careful not too overbake).... I used 5 ounces of bittersweet chocolate and 3 ounce of semi-sweet chocolate. They baked out the way a brownie should be, very moist and chewy, just the perfect texture! they are just delicious!  I'll make these again, thanks so much for a great recipe!...Kittencal:)"
24386,114963,2005-04-12,5,"Wonderful moist fudgy brownies!  Added some chopped walnuts for crunch and served them topped with some vanilla ice cream.  A definite keeper - good brownie recipes are hard to find.  Thanks, Julie."
104295,114963,2005-04-20,5,These are fudgy and wonderful.  But listen to Julie and don't attempt to cut them until they are cool!  I used 3 oz. of unsweetened and 2 oz. of bittersweet and adjusted the sugar down just a tad.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour (as it is all I keep in the house).  These were decadent and fudgy and would be a wonderful base for brownie sundaes!  
308760,114963,2006-04-26,5,"This passed my husband's finicky taste test.  The top has crunchy quality.  I doubled the recipe, followed it exactly, except for using 7x11 pans, as that's the closest I had to 9x9's.  "
68460,114963,2015-02-10,5,I made these today after seeing the recipe in the book by Ruth Reichl.  If you like fudgy type brownies then these are for you.  Absolutely delicious.  I made them exactly as written and we had them as &#039;brownie sundaes&#039;.  This is now my go-to recipe for brownies and I may add mini chocolate chips next time since &quot;you can never have too much chocolate&quot;!  Thanks Ms Bold :)
424680,115225,2007-04-24,5,"Very tasty, chewy bars! I did add a little orange zest to enhance the orange flavor, & it seemed to work well! These will be great as an on-the-go treat, or to have instead of forking out the money for a vending machine! Thanks much for the recipe!"
962690,369446,2009-05-17,5,"ACE!!!!!!!!!!!
These are so delicious.
I kept the onions whole.
I steamed them for a couple minutes and then used the oil but was finding the sauce just slipping off when I was basting so I  just poured the sauce over and let it reduce that way.
We had guest for dinner and there was almost a fight over who got that last couple onions.
Definite keeper.
Made for the Aus/NZ region for ZWT 5 for team Zaar Chow Hounds."
993604,369446,2009-11-08,5,Outstanding!  I am always looking for new vegetable recipes that the whole family will enjoy.  This recipe is easy to make and the flavor is wonderful  I used 10 ounces of pearl onions which I boiled for 3 minutes and then peeled.  I served with Recipe #376703.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Made for PRMR.
220348,369446,2012-08-07,5,"Another great side dish! I love the mix of sweetness from the honey, with the acidity from the balsamic vinegar. It goes well on its own as well as in a salad."
177753,204224,2007-01-18,4,"I made this tonight for a light dinner and it turned out great! I made it exactly as written except left out the salt as suggested. I also added some mixed frozen veggies (corn, carrots, green beans). I think next time I will add a little more cornstarch because I like my broth a little thicker and cut it down to 1 egg. Those are just personal preferences though. Thanks!"
453695,204224,2007-02-20,5,This is as good as it gets!! Tastes just like the soup at a chinese restaurant!! Easy to make!! My friend and I used to hit a chinese buffet once a week. We would drive 30 min to eat at one. I would love to find all my favorite recipes and i'm adding this one to the list. My boyfriend and I LOVE it.
124249,204224,2007-04-16,4,"We enjoyed this quick and easy soup. I think this is the first time we have had ginger in Egg Drop soup and we liked the added flavor. 

Thanks Quest4ZBest. 

Bullwinkle."
742426,204224,2008-01-30,4,I added water chestnuts and carrots to mine and loved it.
789030,204224,2014-12-31,5,Soup tastes great and I love the simplicity of it.
319658,146597,2006-05-21,5,"We absolutely loved these ! This recipe is definitely a keeper ! I didn't add any additions, and let them bake until they were crispy. Next time, I will try them with summer savory instead of poultry seasoning."
56002,146597,2007-10-16,4,"These were very good. I added chopped apples, and fresh sage and thyme from the garden rather than poultry seasoning. Because I was making them for Thanksgiving I always try to make as much as I can ahead of time, so I baked them two days before, stuck them in the freezer and when needed, just reheated for about 15 minutes with foil overtop. They were nice and crispy. We did our turkey on the rotisserie in the BBQ. I do prefer a stuffing outside the bird anyway and will surely make these again, perhaps adding a couple of other of your variations. Thanks foodtvfan!"
369715,146597,2009-12-29,5,We never seen to have enough stuffing so made this on the side. It was easy to make and we all enjoyed them. I followed the recipe exactly as written.
638445,146597,2011-03-29,5,I had a couple random bags of leftover hamburger and hotdog rolls in the bottom drawer of my freezer.  I needed something to do with them.  This was perfect!  I had everything on hand and didn't need to go to the store.  My kids (the taste testers - ages 4 and 7) loved them.  I will make these again for company sometime.
452940,146597,2011-05-26,4,"These were very good and great to make when not cooking a whole bird. My family's traditional stuffing has bacon in it so that's what I did. Saute'd some right up with the celery and onion. Chef error is I didn't reduce the butter by half (did not calculate the bacon grease) and totally forgot the egg to help bind the balls. That said, We gave it 4 stars because although the taste is great, it does not equal stuffing the bird. We would still make again, and recommend to others to try. We got 6 generous sized balls. Thanks for sharing."
706608,146597,2011-08-24,5,"I veganized these and they turned out really well! I used Earth Balance margarine for butter. 1/4 cup apple sauce and 1 tbsp corn starch in place of the egg, and just plain water for the broth. The spices were more then sufficient. Added chopped nuts and dried cranberries. Would definitely make these again. Super simple and yummy!"
482933,146597,2011-11-13,5,"We love stuffing especially the edges and with this you have mostly edges.  The only thing I would do differently, is to put in a bit less celery.  We seldom oven roast a turkey-generally grill ours so this fits right into our lifestyle.  I froze the leftovers.  Thanks foodtvfan for sharing a wonderful recipe!"
653438,146597,2013-09-24,5,Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup 2013 tag game and this was a hit.  I did use some garlic (we love garlic and homemade chicken broth) but other than that followed the instructions.  Going to be making these again soon.  Thank you for posting.  I want to make some extra and put in the freezer for busy times like a previous reviewer did.
2789235,146597,2013-10-06,4,"These were good.  I enjoyed that they were different from traditional stuffing and very easy to prepare.  I enjoyed them, while my kids thought they were ok."
716083,146597,2013-12-01,5,"Perfect! Made them for Thanksgiving, they were a big hit. Thank you for sharing."
1802849661,146597,2015-10-02,5,"Oh these were SO good! I made exactly as the recipe stated, although I&#039;m not the world&#039;s best at cutting bread, so my cubes may have been slightly larger than 1/2 inch! I could easily just eat these plain with nothing else, they tasted amazing!"
2001353856,146597,2017-01-16,0,Have you thought fried it that is what I am going to do use two eggs and panko breadcrumbs or Italian bread crumbs
2001501929,146597,2018-11-22,4,"I thought these were good. However, despite baking them on parchment paper they still got a little dark on the bottoms. Still good IMO. I liked the crunchiness. Hubby said they were good but he still prefers the more traditional stuffing, the wetter kind. I followed the recipe mostly as written but I used vegetable stock instead of chicken(personal preference) and used two eggs instead of one. I forgot to get cranberry sauce; I think if we'd had that to dip them into it would have been even better. Thank you for posting the recipe."
2002348970,146597,2018-11-26,5,"My sister-in-law made the best stuffing balls and I always wanted the recipe but she told me she didn't go by a recipe. She just added the ingredients she bought and threw them together. Well I am her to say, these stuffing balls tasted just like the ones she made and I love them and my whole family fell in love with them. I made them for Thanksgiving and I am going to make them again for Christmas. I can see myself making them throughout the year. My family devoured them. Thank you for the recipe.."
37449,39974,2003-03-28,5,I love the taste of this eggplant! The mixture of tart and sweet were just right. I will be making this again! I broiled it this time but can't wait to grill it outdoors! Thanks!
448662,39974,2007-08-21,4,I really liked the tart taste of this recipe! I'm not sure how I would improve it actually!
98919,39974,2008-07-13,3,This wasn't bad but I thought it was too sweet myself.  I didn't marinated it for very long so maybe that would make a difference.
168462,360859,2009-03-22,4,I made this for Sunday brunch and my family thought it was pretty good and liked the fact it was not too sweet. I did not have cranberries so I subbed raspberries and blueberries in their place. I added them after the apples were cooked. This is easy to make too. Thanks for the recipe.
1058097,415873,2010-08-11,5,"We made this with beef broth, but used it to stir-fry chicken.  Easy to put together, and lovely flavors.  A winner all the way.  Made for Everyday's a Holiday Tag."
37305,42832,2002-11-03,5,"These are easy to put together and delicious.  The plain ones taste just like shortbread cookies!  I made a dozen plain, a dozen with chocolate chips, a dozen with coconut and another dozen with M & M's.  With the rest of the dough I just threw in a little of everything.  This is very versatile and I can't wait to try the chocolate and peanut butter varieties!  The kids loved them!  These would be great for the holidays with some food coloring and colored sugar/sprinkles.  I used a cookie scoop and got 56 cookies out of the batch.  They needed exactly 15 minutes.  Thanks for this easy and yummy recipe!"
64331,42832,2002-12-16,5,These are easy easy and wonderful tasting. I added pecans and semi sweet chocolate chips. I just tasted one of the first batch and it was heavenly! This would be fun to make with the kids. You can let them add what they want to add and each person can have their own personalized cookie. It was so easy to put together that I kept thinking I was missing something. This is going to be one I use often. I made a batch for a Cub Scout Christmas party. I will be proud to take them there. I have another sheet of them in the over right now. You can't miss with this cookie recipe! Thankyou thankyou thankyou for the recipe. 
67103,42832,2003-01-20,5,These are wonderful cookies.  I have made them with yellow and chocolate cake mixes.  I also put them in my cookie press and they turn out beautifully.
88732,42832,2006-12-13,5,"You can make a variety of cookies very easily with this recipe. It is the perfect consistency for a cookie press.   I usually divide my dough in six bowls.  Then I color two for the cookie press, add peanut butter to one bowl to make peanut butter cookies with chocolate stars on top.  To one bowl, I add pecans and then roll into balls and then roll into powdered sugar after baking.  You can make any flavor you wish, using what you have on hand.
It makes a beautiful presentation and people are always in awe that you have baked so many kinds of cookies, when in fact, it was one kind of dough!
Consider this recipe!"
102586,42832,2007-12-08,5,"so easy, so versatile....I divided the dough in 1/3's & put crushed candy canes in one, white chocolate chips and cherries in the 2nd, and dates and nuts in the 3rd !!  One great recipe, 3 different cookies ! Love it, love it...thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.  Bake sales will be a lot easier now.  Thanks again!!"
618391,42832,2007-12-24,2,"This recipe was okay, a little dry and not very sweet. Reminded me more of a butter cookie. It was very easy to make though."
82040,353968,2009-02-05,5,"This is very yummy and I make it during the winter.  In the summer I make the same thing, but use sliced tomatoes instead of the pineapple slices....I love summer tomatoes, so I think this version is more than yummy!!!"
212609,353968,2010-01-16,5,"A simple blend of delicious flavours.
The sweetness of the pineapple works perfectly against the crisp saltiness of the bacon and smooth melted cheese.
I used wholemeal pita bread instead,opened out flat for toasting and then folded back on itself to contain the fillings-yum."
742339,45916,2009-04-14,3,"This is a difficult one to rate. I didn't follow the recipe exactly because it just didn't sound very exciting. However, the three stars come with what happened with the artichokes. They definitely did not get soft in 4 minutes of boiling water (and I know it was boiling). They also turned brown and stayed brown. I tried the suggestion with tossing it with linguine and chicken. That made a nice dish. The parmeasn (or romano because that is what I had in the freezer) gave it a nice flavor. Nice dish except for the very, very firm artichokes!"
32058,64585,2003-07-18,5,"Boiy is this ever YUMMY.  I made it for company and used Texas Toast.  It turned out perfect.  Only one slice was needed for each of us girls, DH had 2 or 3.  Very rich, could pass for dessert but what a treat in the Am w/ a good cuppa joe!"
52543,64585,2004-04-05,5,Delicious! I sliced cinnamon raisin bread very thick & served it with fresh fruit & coffee on Sunday morning. Thanx Marie! 
148903,64585,2004-12-28,5,"Amazingly easy, very tasty - was part of our Xmas morning breakfast!  Does not make a sauce, just a ""topping"" of caramel....very good."
141293,64585,2005-05-09,5,Yummy.  A sweet way to start the day.  Used a maple walnut bread from a local bakery.  Rich and delicious.
110905,64585,2005-11-06,5,"Made this for the college girls weekend. Easy to prepare, (after a fun evening),and they all enjoyed it, even the non-breakfast eaters."
115903,64585,2005-11-26,5,"Thank you for the yummy recipe.  I added some candied, toasted pecans to the caramel mix and some cinnamon to the egg mix and felt like I was serving a gourmet dessert for breakfast.  Like you said the bottom caramelized side, especially with the pecans, makes for a gorgeous presentation when serving.  Yummy and fancy looking! PS I made this the same morning and don't think the flavor was sacrificed."
264198,64585,2005-12-05,2,"I was a bit disappointed in the dish after all the great reviews.  I think perhaps I did something wrong.  Perhaps I needed to use thicker bread.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular bread.  The carmel part turned out excellent, but overall my husband and I agree it had too eggy of a taste.  Perhaps I should have cut down on the number of eggs.  However, my friend loved the recipe and wants to get it from me, so maybe it is just different people's tastes."
214911,64585,2006-08-13,5,"What a wonderful treat this was for breakfast! Like others, I made this in the AM and just let it sit for about 20 minutes before putting it in the oven. I added cinnamon and vanilla to both the caramel layer and the custard mixture, and added about a half cup brown sugar to the custard as well. My family gobbled it up, and made me promise to make it again--SOON!"
344895,64585,2006-10-21,3,"It was ok.  The sauce is great when you first start eating it, but then it just kind of sits in your stomach.  I had two slices."
290744,64585,2009-06-21,4,"This was great! Really delicious. A very special father's day breakfast. Made is think of cinnamon buns. I added walnuts with the caramel, and cloves and ginger to the egg batter. I pulled it out of the oven 10 minutes early so we had caramel sauce instead of baked caramel. It is a very heavy dish, though. I'd pair it with something like fruit salad, not eggs and bacon."
1166781,64585,2009-09-12,5,"This was amazing. I added 1/2 cup of pecans to the caramel mixture, it tasted just like pecan pie...yummy! I agree with other reviewers and next time I won't make it the night before, I'll just soak the bread in the egg mixture in the morning for a little while before popping it in the oven. Thanks for a delicious recipe!"
855802,144841,2008-06-08,0,This is incredibly easy to make and tastes delicious!  Dianne from VA
68884,144841,2010-05-06,5,"Delicious, delicious, delicious!!
My DH â€” not a baker â€” wanted this cake after seeing it in the May 2010 Southern Living. He decided to make it himself, and it is surprisingly divine. Homey, dense, buttery, with a slightly crunchy exterior. We topped with a bit of powdered sugar and paired the slices with fresh, sliced strawberries. Heavenly."
65765,386901,2009-08-27,5,"Awesome!  Thanks!!  I love avocados but they are spendy, and when they go on sale I can't eat them fast enough!  So this is perfect.  Have you ever cubed them and tossed with lemon juice to freeze?  I wonder how that works..."
117209,386901,2009-08-30,0,"Thanks, I have Avocados ripening as I write. Never knew you could freeze them, great news for me, cause in Florida where i'm from My neihbors have Avocado Trees.   Though they are not as good as the Haas they are still tasty.and you cant beat Free.
I will freeze them and then write a review. Thanks in advance.
Flamom"
739360,386901,2009-09-13,5,Wow I never would have thought you could freeze avocados. I just threw out one I paid $1.99 for here in Texas.  Wish I had known about this years ago!  Thanks for posting.
195589,386901,2009-09-21,5,"WOW, what a great tip! I have a second job in food retail, sometimes there are over 10 avos a week they will throw away, if I don't take them. I was getting sick of guac. LOL Thanks for posting."
1061628,386901,2009-09-27,5,"Why didn't I know this??  Great idea!  I will be doing this forever, thank you much."
1193707,386901,2011-02-21,5,"Wow, excellent!  The local Meijer's supermarket has avocado sales every once in a while--like 10 for $5--and I never buy because my husband and I can't possibly eat them all soon enough.  Your solution is wonderful.  Thanks so much for sharing.  ;-)"
471004,386901,2015-11-26,5,"Love this idea!  I have 3 avocados that are ripe right now &amp; I know I won&#039;t be able to eat all of them.  I will update this with my star rating after I have tried them frozen.  Thanks for posting Mama :)
Update Nov 2015
I do this all the time now with a slight modification.  I toss my avocado in the blender with the lemon juice, then I put it in a pastry bag &amp; fill ice cube trays with the mixture.  When frozen I pop them out, bag &amp; label &amp; toss back in the freezer.  It works great!  I just pull out the number of frozen cubes I need, let them thaw a bit &amp; add to my recipe.   Thanks again Mama!"
285039,368158,2009-05-30,4,This is a nice quick sauce to use for pizza or pasta. I mixed the basil in the sauce after it simmered....I just can't shake the region of Italy from which my family came...we use basil in our sauce.  I also used crushed tomato because my kids don't like chunky sauce; it required a tiny bit more salt and sugar in the end because of this.
804550,368158,2009-05-31,5,"I too used crushed tomatoes and add a tablespoon of sugar to compensate (No fault of the recipe).
Unlike Cooks4_6 I didn't add any additional salt as we eat low sodium. Made for Spring Photo Tag 2009."
68960,368158,2009-05-31,5,"This was lovely and quick to make and perfect served over our spaghetti.  I did add some extra basil while cooking as it was there and I couldn't help myself, I just  love fresh basil."
280271,368158,2009-06-01,5,I loved the ease in making this sauce. I whipped it together for dinner tonight. I did cut the olive oil in half and I'm glad I did because it was on the oily side. I used the stewed tomatoes and simmered it uncovered to thicken it up because it was on the runny side. I loved the sweet flavor of this sauce. I always add a touch of sugar when I make homemade. This has a wonderful garlic flavor. I served it over spaghetti and threw in some meatballs for DH. Thanks for posting. :)
383346,368158,2009-09-02,4,"I used green onion, a can of diced tomatoes.  Something was missing, like maybe more herbs like oregano, thyme...  But it's a great sauce to do in no time, so easy to do.  Thanks BK :)  Made for Gimme 5 tag game"
133174,368158,2009-09-09,4,"Yes, you can make a tasty sauce in a matter of minutes.  I used diced cut tomatoes which were lightly broken up with a potato masher.  I added frozen turkey meatballs and served this over angel hair pasta for a delicious dinner."
212609,368158,2009-12-09,5,"Quick,easy and very tasty.
I took TeresaS's advice and cut back on the oil,which worked out really well.
I added a dash of bicarbonate of soda,just to take the acidic sting out of the tomatoes.
Kids have been loving this sauce,and I've had multiple requests for pasta in the last week!
Great cooked up with some finely diced veggies tossed into it,and it freezes beautifully too!
Thanks BK..."
315565,368158,2010-02-02,5,Gorgeous and easy ! I used tomatoes from the garden and some herbs. Served with gnocchi and cheese. Thanks for lovely dinner.
157425,368158,2010-04-22,5,This is a very easy and great tasting marina recipe that I doubled so I would have some to freeze for lasagna later. I used two 28 ounce cans of WalMart brand pear tomato strips with basil in puree and two packages of Truvia sugar substitute. Served over Barilla's whole wheat spaghetti and topped with grated parmesan cheese and enjoyed our supper. Made and reviewed for Pick A Chef Spring 2010.
573325,368158,2010-11-07,5,"Oh this is soooooo good! It tastes exactly like the marinara sauce in our favourite Italian Restaurant. YUM!<br/>The garlic, onion and parsley are the perfect match to the fruity tomato. Mmmm!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this easy and super yummy recipe with us, BK!<br/>Made and reviewed for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #46 November 2010 - Group Beetroot."
339260,368158,2010-11-12,5,"This is an excellent marinara recipe.  I'm usually more of a spaghetti sauce person, but I could use this recipe again and again.  I pureed the tomatoes because I like my sauce on the smoother side instead of chunky.  All the ingredients complimented each other very well.  I added meatballs and served it over spaghetti noodles.  A side salad and some Italian bread with dipping oil and I was in pasta heaven.  Made for Nov 2010 Aus/NZ Swap."
1680722,368158,2011-05-30,5,"Thanks for the tasty marinara recipe. Did not have sweet onion, so I soaked a chopped one in iced water for one hour. This works very well.<br/>Delicious over pasta.<br/>Done for ZWT7"
482376,368158,2011-05-31,5,"Oh my goodness, this is some GREAT pasta sauce!! I served this as a vegetarian option at a family reunion. Everyone loved the sauce. My sister-in-law couldn't stop raving about it and said it was the best pasta sauce she has had since Italy. Now that is a high compliment! I doubled the sauce and stirred in one pound of cooked angel hair pasta. The only change I used, to make things easier on me while preparing dinner for 18 people, was to use Muir Glen organic chunky tomato sauce instead of the whole/peeled tomatoes. Made for ZWT 7 - Italy Holidays and Entertaining Challenge. Gratzie!"
386585,368158,2011-06-03,4,"This was a really tasty marinara sauce, but I do wish that I had cut back on the olive oil, as it ended up being a bit more oily than I like.  I doubled the recipe and froze half the sauce for later use.  I used some San Marzano tomatoes, which were excellent. For the sweet onion, I used a Vidalia.   I also added the fresh basil with the other seasonings.  I can think of some many uses for this sauce.  I will be making this again.  Made for ZWT7 by a Hot Pink Lady."
330545,368158,2011-10-06,5,"A really good quality sauce.  Lots of olive oil, I agree, but we like it that way.  Left mine a bit on the chunky side, again to please the family. Made for Aus/NZ recipe swap #56."
527607,368158,2014-08-24,5,This was TASTY.  Delish and easy to put together. Sprinkled with parmesan
1052873,368158,2014-08-27,5,Excellent sauce. I used fresh tomatoes and the crock pot. Made for CQ 14.
174096,368158,2014-09-16,5,This is a great sauce! Very flavorful and easy - and it&#039;s nice that it only needs a short time to simmer before it is ready - makes it perfectly feasible to make your own sauce even in a hurry. I ended up removing the lid for the last few minutes to help thicken it up a bit. Thanks for sharing! Culinary Quest &#039;14
222523,92772,2005-06-22,2,"Uggh... too healthy for me. It didn't have too much flavor, I felt like I was drinking a protein shake. I drank a few sips and then threw it down the drain. If you are really into health, try it. But otherwise, don't."
181231,107852,2005-01-08,5,"I omited cloves and added 3Tbs.cinnamon red hots.Topped with vanilla ice cream. Very pretty,quick and easy."
582946,107852,2008-01-05,4,"Very tasty and simple to make. I had no cloves, so simply added in a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  Instead of cream, I served the apples with creme brulee."
872562,66899,2008-08-02,4,"Very very good! I don't know what Head Country seasoning is, so I just used salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I used A LOT less bacon in my version. (I had 1.25 pounds of pork loin, and only used two thick strips of bacon, cut in half, then halved vertically, so really, just a few ounces of bacon).  I also cooked mine at 325 but that's because I have an oven with a mind of it's own.  It's done when the interior temp of the pork tenderloin is 155 to 160.  Thanks for the recipe!"
968501,66899,2008-10-04,5,"Absolutely delicious!  I'm amazed at how tender the pork was without having to marinate.  We plan on playing with different types of bacon (pepper bacon, applewood bacon, etc) to see what flavors we can find, but this is definitely a keeper for us!"
102058,203230,2008-11-08,4,"Very good ! This went into the blender and was ready in no time flat. The size of the banana will  make a difference to how thick this ends up coming out, having made this more than once now I found that one occasion it was rather solid ! (I added more orange juice) please see my rating system: 4 wonderful stars for a wonderful way to start the day. Thanks!"
383346,397085,2009-11-15,5,I did half the cake in a 9 inch round pan.  But I would use a smaller pan another time.  The cake is really good and moist.  You mention the nuts in the direction but not in the ingredients.  I omitted them.  I used half sugar cause I didn't want it too sweet.  Perfect like that.  The frosting also is great.  Thanks Invictus :)  Made for PRMR tag game
593513,397085,2009-11-19,4,"This is a really moist cake. First time making carrot cake in a pan like this though. I greased my pan but still had to fight to get it out of pan. Next time I don't think I would cool in pan, I would take it out right away and let cool on rack. Might of been easier to get out. There were 2 errors in the recipe though, the first one when you say to add the nuts it is not in the ingredients and in the frosting you mention to add the vanilla but not in the ingredients. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and that worked out delicious. Makes alot of frosting though. Had to cook mine for an extra 10 minutes. Turned out to be a good cake. Thanks for your recipe invictus. Made for the Holdiay Tag '09"
140008,88828,2007-01-24,4,"This rice was pretty easy to make.  I made this for OAMC. Only change I made was leaving out the mushrooms.  It's like stuffing, but it's rice!  I think that there is too much poultry seasoning and parsley in this.  They totally overwhelm the other flavors.  With that said, I would make this again, because it makes  a great side dish, I would just use a lot less parsley, maybe 1 tablespoon or even less, and only 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning. Thanks for the recipe!"
54856,88828,2007-09-03,4,We did enjoy this recipe but the 2nd time I made a few changes which we felt made it even better. Since my family isnt fond of celery I only used 1 cup. I then added a package of frozen green peas for color and taste and also 2 beaten eggs which seemed to make it more moist.  I took it to a church supper and none was left to take home!
1308875,392655,2009-10-07,5,Really yummy!  I will definetely be making this for my family to try!  I've never had a baked red pepper and actually like them now this way!  This has also enabled me to start liking Feta cheese!  Thanks.  I think this recipe would be great with some parmesan.  I added a picture of my single serving before baking it.
987323,392655,2010-09-13,5,"Here's the changes I made to suit my pantry:  used canola oil -- instead of olive oil, used a garlic salt and parsley mix --instead of fresh garlic, added extra feta ( I love cheese! ), and left off the basil --I was out.  I cooked my single serving in my toaster oven for 30 minutes and it was perfect!  This was a super yummy dinner that was easy to throw together.  I only wish I had made another serving for myself!"
526666,355413,2009-03-12,5,"These turned out very well; I did add some extra cheese, in the last few minutes of cooking. I also forgot to spray the crockpot :-( . They were very easy to fix and forget! Thanks, weekend cooker, for a new twist!"
621626,355413,2009-07-15,5,Absolutely Delicious! I didn't have a lot of time before dinner so I cooked it on high for 2 hours. Made for 123 HITS
719313,355413,2009-07-21,5,"Wow, these are so simple to make and the bacon really added a lot of flavor.  My family usually turns up their noses to anything from a box, but this recipe proved the exception. Ha! Loved that I can put it in the crock pot, and easy enough that my 12yo, wants to throw it together next time.  It went great with our BBQ Brisket dinner."
614389,355413,2009-09-06,5,These were so easy to make and delicious ! I used real bacon bits and it turned out great. My husband and I will be making this again and again.
206747,355413,2010-02-04,5,"*Made for Australian/ NZ swap #37*
MUST say this was surprisingly tasty, as I NEVER have used ""boxed"" potato preps !  Followed directions, and the potatoes were saucy and delicious -- if a tad soupy, but that was partly absorbed as they cooled.  Topped with ""cooked"" bacon which I nuked for 1.5 minutes.  Thanks for posting, weekend cooker.  They were eye-appealing, wish I had planned to photograph !"
204024,355413,2010-10-11,5,Very easy to prepare.  We love potatoes in any form.  Made for Aus/NZ swap Oct. 2010.
50969,61874,2011-11-30,4,"Before getting on with my review, I want to say "" That I'm very pleased to be the first one to rate this recipe "".:) This was made on 11/29/11 using T-Day leftovers from 11/27/11.Since it was just two of us, the recipe was cut in half. Also instead of topping the broccoli with the onion, the onion was softened while melting the margarine. Instead of using half-and-half or milk, I subbed evaporated milk that needed to be used up.And since I'm a cheese freak, a bit was added to the top before baking.The taste was very good,but we both felt that it needed "" something more "". Maybe if I make this again, I'll add a bit of garlic powder to the sauce. Thanks for taking the time to post this recipe and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
50362,31230,2002-07-28,5,"Wow! This made me and my husband very happy, because it was easy and we had biscotti to perfection with an hour.  I separated the dough into thirds flavoring each third differently. The first log was made using only the basic recipe excluding the almonds (I didn't have any on hand) the second portion I added just almond extract and the third portion I added almond extract and walnuts and boy we loved them all. Next time I will try dipping the biscotti in chocolate. I will definately make this biscotti again. I hope to make baskets as gifts for those at Christmas who love biscotti with coffee and tea. Thank you, this recipe is a definate keeper for me and hopefully generations to come. The Kentuckian"
55393,31230,2002-09-20,5,Excellent!! First time I have made Biscotti and it was great. I used Walnuts becuase it is what I had and just to be different I put in 1 tbsp of vanilla. Then powdered sugar when done. I loved it!
43478,31230,2003-03-22,5,Terrific & easy!! I took out the nuts and added cranberries and orange est with a little dip in white chocolate.....used to buy it. Now I make it. Yummy!! Thanks for this recipe!
59801,31230,2004-03-13,5,A great basic biscotti.  I will defintely make these again.  Thanks!!  :)
124358,31230,2004-04-24,4,"This is a great recipe, but next time my dad (a pastry chef) suggested that I should maybe try 1/8tsp baking soda and 1/8tsp baking powder to make the biscotti even more firm.  I think I might add less sugar too cause I found them just a bit too sweet.  I added Ricard liqueur to half of the batch (I had no anis at home) and it was sooooo yummy. I made chocolate/mint biscottis with the other half. I love these cookies cause you can be so creative :)    "
18207,31230,2004-04-26,5,This is my first Biscotti recipe. I love it! It is so easy and exactly what I was looking for. I will definately make these again.
63717,31230,2004-05-17,5,"Love this biscotti, Each time I add something different to please the taste buds. The best added item todate has been almonds, white chocolate chunks and cranraisins.  My son loves it with chocolate chips .  So the basic is now turned into something special with no added work."
164526,31230,2004-09-26,4,"Great recipe! I also decreased the sugar and left out the almonds because I am allergic. To add some fiber, I substituted a cup of the flour with whole grain oat flour. I added some chocolate pieces to the dough.  Next time I'll try it with some grated lemon zest! Thanks for this recipe."
170100,31230,2005-08-28,4,First time biscotti maker. I put in a tsp of vanilla. If I were to make them again would probably use two. Very easy and the idea will be used in the future. Are they supposed to be so hard??? Maybe I missed something. 
255013,31230,2005-10-24,5,"awsome biscotti recipe i used fitzjams advice and used 2 tsp of vanilla i had planned on just adding 1 till i saw his post thanks Fitz, i use to use martha stuarts hazelnut biscotti recipe but substituted for almonds. i like this recipe alot better and my friends all love it. also if you want you can add 1 tblsp of amaretto creamer to the flour mixture."
225372,31230,2005-12-04,5,"Okay, I was totally freaking out because the dough was really crumby and the biscotti burnt, but luckily I persevered, because I managed to rescue them and produce fantastic tasting biscotti! Too fiddly for me, but if ever stuck in on a rainy day I'd like to try diff. variations"
385423,31230,2007-02-04,5,"Added 2 tsp. of vanilla, used 1 2/3 cup sugar and 1/8 tsp. salt and baking soda instead.  Divided the dough in half and added toasted almond slivers to one half and mini-choc. chips to the other.  They turned out fantastic!  My husband loved them.  Took them to an owner of a shoe store in the area and she ordered 2 dozen on top of the rest of her order for a trunk show on the spot!  She just emailed me and said everything was delishious--especially the great biscotti.  So yeah, this recipe is a keeper!"
404988,31230,2007-03-12,4,"My first ever try at biscotti for my kids dad for Christmas.  It was too hard because I over baked them, but they had a fantastic taste.  Would love some input on how to best cut them though.  A bit crumbly."
479324,31230,2007-04-07,5,Very good. I added mint and vanilla extract and dark chocolate chips. Awesome.
526614,31230,2007-08-23,5,"excellent recipe.  this is real biscotti - i'm sick of seeing recipes for ""biscotti"" with butter or oil in them.  they are supposed to be very firm & crunchy - like these - not soft.  very good recipe.  thank you."
670067,31230,2007-12-08,2,I followed the amounts and directions closely but was disappointed with the dough consistency...kept falling apart...difficult to handle
354150,31230,2008-01-29,4,"Great basic recipe.  I personally don't like a ton of sugar in baked goods, so I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Also added about a cup each of chopped dried apricots and dark chocolate chips.  Might have just been the added apricot and chocolate but next time I make this I will use even less sugar, probably a cup, as the biscotti was still a bit sweet for me.  Also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract."
749879,31230,2008-04-22,5,"Such a great, basic recipe!  Other reviewers are on to something - you can definitely enjoy these plain or add dried fruit, other nuts, chocolate chips, coconut, fruit zest, etc!  I used 4 oz coconut instead of almonds and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups because I live at 7000 feet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar more; if you add any sweet ingredients (even unsweetened coconut) it gets too sweet."
882785,31230,2008-07-06,4,"I had a hard time with the dough, I couldn't get all the dry ingredients to incorporate, but mostly. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. After slicing I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking again. These are a bit harder than other recipes I've made, but are very good. Next time I will probably add a touch of milk to the dough."
939257,31230,2008-09-27,4,"Substituted 1 cup of the flour for Whole Wheat and reduced the sugar by 1/4 of a cup - but they really were still too sweet (and i'm a sweets person!). Added extra salt balanced it out a bit. Also added a bit of vanilla - really have to work together the dough, but it's not too bad. Good, hard biscotti though. Good recipe for tweaking!"
1225606,31230,2009-04-03,4,"Good recipe! I'm new to biscotti and have had some flops. This was easy. Too sweet though. I used 1 cup sugar- 1/2 white, 1/2 brown and they were very sweet. I also only had 2 eggs so I SUBSTITUED plain YOGURT the 1 & these turned out great!  Added anise and almond extract- yummy.  This is a great basic biscotti to play with. Firm just as biscottii should be for dippping! Excellent."
1375199,31230,2010-02-06,4,"Overall the taste is pretty good and it is a very easy recipe. However, the chef who commented that the egg smell was too much is correct. When doing step # 12, I almost gagged. I did sprinkle cinnamon on the cut pieces which did hide the smell a bit once they were done. Next time I'd use only 2 eggs and try the yogurt idea."
2710499,310570,2013-02-25,5,great recipe - very much like the real thing from back home in Montenegro!
182010,305766,2008-05-30,5,"A great simple sauce!  I added a crushed chili and fresh ginger and it was super!! Thanks, Gerry."
29356,305766,2008-05-31,5,"What a wonderful easy sauce!  The flavor of the ginger really shined through!  This was easy enough for my kids to make.

Thanks!

107651,305766,2008-06-04,5,"I really enjoyed the many flavours of this Oriental Ginger sauce. I used fresh ginger and added the crushed chilies and some garlic. I used the sauce to baste a chicken breast, bet it would be great on salmon steaks too!!"
50969,305766,2009-03-23,4,"I made this on 3/23/09 for the ""Spring PAC 2009 "" event.Since I don't have a grill, I doubled the recipe and used it as a marinade instead.And I have to tell you, it made a very good marinade. Step 2 reads to brush on pork or chicken, but it works really well on beef too.;) .This will be made again. Thanks for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :) """
339260,305766,2010-03-21,5,"Now that's what 'I'm talking about...a sauce that is quick and easy to throw together and you don't have to marinate the meat.  I made the sauce exactly as written adding some freshly grated ginger and crushed red pepper flakes.  I cooked chicken tenders on the grill, basting them until all the sauce was used up.  I like to use chicken tenders because they cook faster and you don't have to worry about whether or not the middle of a chicken breast has cooked through.  The flavors were sensational.  The chicken tasted like it had been marinating all night.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for March, 2010 Aussie/NZ Swap."
223854,305766,2010-06-09,5,This was a delicious basting sauce.  I basted a chicken breast over a hot barbecue (yes we are in the middle of winter and yes it was pouring rain) and it was yummy!  The sauce was put together in a matter of seconds and the chicken was really tender.  I served with with a bok choy and mushroom stir-fry and Recipe #371405.  Thanks so much for posting your recipe Gerry
233780,305766,2010-07-30,5,A really lovely great sauce! full of flavour - I used a teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. I brushed some of the sauce on the chicken a few hours before hand. <br/>We barbecued it last night and it was served with potato salad and tossed salad. Thanks for posting!
329769,305766,2010-08-01,5,Delicious basted on chicken breast fillets and cooked on the barbie. Served with a garden salad on the side for a great dinner
463435,305766,2011-03-01,4,A nice simple sauce that goes together quickly. I found that even though I used 1/2 sesame oil and half olive oil the sesame oil still seemed to overpower the other ingredients. I bought a new brand of sesame oil however; and it could be that this brand is stronger in flavor then the one I used to buy. I will definitely use this again though when the weather warms and I can grill outdoors. For now I have to be content with my indoor electric grill. Made and reviewed for the Best of 2010 Recipe Tag game.

1593428,310570,2011-07-01,5,this was so yummy and not to difficult to make. thanks for a great recipe!
2000743062,310570,2016-11-12,4,"Very nice recipe, but missing a few things for me. It needs a pinch of allspice in my opinion, a hint of paprika and a small squeeze of lemon. And, of course, spinach. To me Bosnian cheese B&ouml;rek is always with spinach. Just makes it so much better"
269480,362340,2009-05-28,5,"Aye, good day! sooooo easy, rich and wonderful! Love it alot! Thanks, Ummbinat. I'll be making this often! Made for ZWT5- Caribbean - Zaar Chow Hounds."
171790,362340,2009-05-31,5,This is a lovely and quick dessert. I used the honey option to make this truely representative of the Caribbean. Made for Jammin' Java Jivers ZWT.

If this was chilled or frozen or whipped into a smoothie with yogurt, I think it would be much better.  Love the flavor combo, but I'd make some changes.  Made this with Recipe #222225 and Recipe #302136 for ZWT5 Jammin Java Jivers.  Thanks!"
407338,362340,2009-08-30,5,A wonderful recipe for breakfast or snack.  I added a small scoop of ice cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Easy preparation and a delight to eat!  Prepared as a participant in the Aug 2009 Ramadan Tag Game Event.
621626,362340,2009-08-31,5,Very Tasty! I did think it was a little too sweet & I only used 3 tbsp of maple syrup. I sprinkled cinnamon on top before serving. Made for Ramadan Tag
601607,362340,2010-04-18,4,"Looking at the listed ingredients, I had a fair idea of how it would taste. But the end product was indeed much better than my guess.  Coconut milk is a daily feature in my curries and bananas are our favourite fruit, but who would have thought the combination of these 2 would make such an interesting dessert! I sprinkled cinnamon on top before serving and it was delicious! I think I'll have it chilled the next time an ice-cream craving attacks me. Thanks for posting!"
522099,362340,2010-05-21,5,What a lovely way to start a morning.  I liked this a lot more than I expected to.  DH loved it too.  I used the honey option and skipped the cinnamon.  Chilled it about 30 minutes.  I would love to sprinkle some granola over this too.  We'll have this again.  Made for ZWT6 by a Looney Spooner.
328048,362340,2010-05-23,4,"I enjoyed this for breakfast. I've never used coconut milk before, although I have some in the pantry. I've enjoyed bananas with regular milk, but I liked this better. I added cinnamon, perhaps more than was intended as my shaker went out of control, but I enjoyed the extra flavor. My only complaint, and it's a pure personal preference, is the texture. I think the addition of granola or another cereal would add dimension and flavor to this lovely dish. Thanks!"
92006,362340,2010-05-27,5,"Mmmmm! I just had half of this for breakfast and I loved it! I just drizzled honey on top of the bananas without measuring, maybe 1 tbs. This will be one of my usual breakfasts from now on, and I'll be adding some almonds or pecans next time to make it more filling. Thank you very much for sharing this! Made for Swizzle Chicks and ZWT6."
424680,362340,2010-05-28,5,"Very nicely satisfying little dessert, this! I did use a darker, more flavorful honey & added a bit of cinnamon as well! So easy to make, this would do well as one of those spur-of-the-moment desserts! Thanks for posting the reicipe! [Made & reviewed while in Asia with ZWT6]"
174096,362340,2010-05-30,5,So easy and so good!!  I just loved this wonderful treat.  I used the honey option and included the cinnamon.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing!
157167,362340,2010-06-02,5,This was interesting.  My son loved it and asked for more - the coconut milk was too strong for my tastes.  For ZWT6 N.
358513,362340,2010-08-25,5,Delicious and simple Gfree dessert. I had 2 small cans of coconut milk but I agree this would be better if I had some nice organic coconut milk. I love Bananas and milk so this is a nice version. I used black Molasses in place of honey. This is a keeper. Thanks. Made for Ramadan Tag 2010
311003,362340,2010-10-07,4,"This is a delicious and easy-to-prepare snack.  I topped it with some Vermont maple syrup I received as a gift, which worked really well with the other ingredients.  I also tried the suggestion of another reviewer and added a little granola as a topping as well, for some texture and additional flavor.  We really enjoyed this!"
573325,362340,2010-10-09,5,"Mmm, this was good! I never ate bananas with coconut milk before and was pleasantly surprised by the flavour. I only had one banana but used the full amount of coconut milk so I had more of a soup with banana slices in it but I liked that!<br/>THANK YOU VERY MUCH for sharing this yummy recipe with us, UmmBinat.<br/>Made and reviewed for Veggie Swap #27 October 2010."
185387,362340,2010-12-04,5,I made this yummy dish for breakfast and have to admit I too never had banana's with coconut milk. I used honey on top and sprinkled all with cinnamon. Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish UmmBinat. Will definitely make again for breakfast.. Loved it.. :)
166642,362340,2011-01-18,5,This is very good! It made a wonderful breakfast for me. Thanks for sharing.
852554,362340,2011-05-31,5,"Delicious and easy!  Of course, being Canadian, I HAD to use maple syrup!  And since I have some coconut milk left, I may just have it for breakfast too!  Thanks!"
804550,362340,2013-03-07,5,"Delicious rendition of an old classic! Works perfectly for with the ingredients. I used the cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of locally produced clover honey. And since I was only making it for myself, I only used one banana. Made for a RecipeNap in the March 2013 Veg n Swap tag."
2001102678,362340,2017-05-08,5,Sounds like breakfast for people on the go
6164,29184,2002-05-23,4,"Hi..I sauteed Asparagus lightly and proceeded with the rest of the recipe..it was greeeeeaaaat !
It really helps when someone like you posts easy recipes with great tastes..keep it up :-)"
39946,29184,2002-06-17,5,"Delicious and easy!  The sauce doesn't overpower the flavor of the asparagus, and won't clash with your main dish.  I may increase the soy & vinegar by half again as much the next time I make it, but it was divine as written!

I liked roasting the asparagus rather than boiling nutrients away.  Smelled great in the oven, too!"
17095,29184,2003-06-06,5,This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  It has my kids begging for more. I agree that you must use real butter for exceptional taste.
17803,29184,2003-06-10,5,Another great asparagus recipe here.  The sauce added a mild flavor and it did not over powder the asparagus.  I'll double the sauce the next time I make this.  Also I baked mine for about 17 minutes.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.
39547,29184,2005-01-02,5,"Made the roasted asparagus tonight to go along with our Italian dinner, and it was wonderful!  Our guests asked for the recipe.  :)  In addition to trimming the asparagus stem ends, I used a vegetable peeler to take off the outside of about 1/2 to 1 inch of the end of each piece of asparagus, and it worked really well to get rid of the fibrous bits.  Also sprinkled it with Parmesan before serving."
165899,29184,2005-01-04,5,"Oooh baby baby - sooo good!!  This was so easy and tasty I was licking my fingers after eating it (yes, I was picking them up instead of using a fork - what a heathen!).  "
94272,29184,2005-02-08,5,"What a quick, easy recipe! The 12 minute roasting was perfect (I had some skinny skinny asparagus) and I greased the pan with olive oil instead of cooking spray, for more flavor. Loved the sauce, and do be sure to let the butter brown a little to get that great flavor. Even my cooked-veggie-hating hubby looked at it kind of longingly, it smelled so good... but he didn't take the plunge. So, MORE FOR ME! Delicious, thanks so much for the recipe!"
43642,29184,2005-02-10,4,"I made this using both asparagus and brussels sprouts.  We liked the asparagus, but we loved the brussels sprouts!  The sauce is different and I like that it enhances the veggies without drowning them out.  Thank you, this was very good!"
174919,29184,2005-03-05,5,I know this recipe from my Cooking Lite cook book. I recently moved and misplaced the book - luckily I quickly found it here. This is an amazing way to serve asparagus. And it goes so well with steak and wine!
39857,29184,2005-04-03,5,"This recipe is now making regular appearances on our table, as it has become our favorite way of preparing asparagus. Perfect balance of flavors!"
176615,29184,2005-04-03,5,"Delicious! Browned butter gives this sauce some real depth. It was much more flavorful than I thought it would be with such simple ingredients. Just fabulous! I made as directed except subbed a very light brush of olive oil for cooking spray. We'll have this often. Thanks, AngelaTN, for posting!"
203013,29184,2005-04-29,5,"Very yummy, and super easy!  I didn't realize I was out of balsamic vinegar until I was getting ready to make this, so I used rice wine vinegar instead (figured I'd just do an Asian version since I was already using soy sauce).  It worked great, and my guests were pleased!"
8086,29184,2005-05-10,5,"Fabulous!  I have gotten other good recipes from Recipezaar, but this is the first one I've ever loved enough to comment on!  I'm have a batch in fromt of me as I write this!  I did use a little olive oil instead of the cooking spray."
109353,29184,2005-05-29,5,"Very good! Light and tangy sauce beautifully complemented the asparagus. Roasting asparagus is the way to go - nice, nutty flavor. I will never boil or steam again! Thanks so much!"
121690,29184,2005-07-21,5,"I made this tonight using delicious Villa Manodori balsamic vinegar. Villa Manodori is an aged (10-20 yrs) balsamic which is exceptionally smooth, thick & rich. It's expensive but a small amount carries a giant dollop of flavor, as this dish proves. My sister asked me to repeat the recipe to her as we were eating. Excellent!"
415204,29184,2007-02-23,5,This was fantastic..will always make this recipe..next time going to try it in the grill..Thanks
28729,29184,2007-03-17,5,Awesome recipe for asparagus. The balsamic really brings the flavor out and roasting is the only way to go in my opinion. You have a winner on this one Angela. Thanks for posting.  Jan
60575,29184,2007-03-26,5,I will definitely make this recipe again...and again and again... this has become one of my absolute favorites. Just a perfect blend of flavors. Wonderful. Thanks for posting Angela.
345314,29184,2007-04-18,5,I tried switching the amounts of soy sauce and balsamic vingegar to 1 teaspoon of soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar and it is equally yummy!
346860,29184,2008-01-30,5,"OMG.... these asparagus are delicious!!!!
The soy is a nice addition to the balsamic- I did however switch up the 2 to 1 ratio of the soy to balsamic, only because I am a balsamic fanatic and WOW are they divine! *Update.... I love to drizzle this FABULOUS sauce over pork tenderloin as well. Ohhhh, yum!

Thanks for an awesome recipe!!! We'll definitely be making these again!"
61520,29184,2008-05-08,5,WOW!  I am an asparagus fanatic and this is by far the best recipe I have found yet for keeping asparagus so fresh tasting with great seasoning and so easy.  Thank you so much for posting this!!!
679759,29184,2008-05-15,5,"This was great!  Even my kids thought it was wonderful!  
As an added bonus it is a very simple recipe!"
243474,29184,2008-10-15,5,"Easy to prepare and ready in minutes. I've made this several times. In addition to spraying the asparagus I spray the cookie sheet before lining up the asparagus. Have cooked exactly as written with regular cooking spray and also with olive oil cooking spray and it works well, too. Always use low sodium soy sauce. Delicious!"
191015,29184,2008-10-25,5,"I never got so many compliments on a vegetable before!  
Asparagus come out crisp/tender and the taste is out of this world!"
772253,29184,2009-01-01,5,I will make this again!
1052207,29184,2009-04-01,5,Great and simple.  Even the black bits were good! A squeeze of lemon juice as I served it lifted the whole taste too.
485728,29184,2009-04-19,5,"I loved this side dish, so good!  I added an extra teaspoon of soy sauce and half teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, and it worked out well.  The flavors worked great with asparagus.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
189475,29184,2009-04-25,5,Delicious and very easy to make. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
311926,29184,2009-05-04,5,This was delicious and easy! I've never been a huge fan of asparagus but I just couldn't get enough of this! Thanks so much for a great recipe.
311645,29184,2009-07-26,5,"This is my new favorite side dish!  Healthy and so flavorful!  I've made it twice, once with a chicken main dish, and once with salmon.  It's great for a weeknight side dish, but fancy enough for guests."
1176426,29184,2009-08-06,5,This is an awesome recipe! I should have commented much earlier because I've made this so many times now I can't remember. I was never a fan of asparagus and this dish made me love it. My fiance is also a big lover of this recipe and requests I cook it probably too often. Thanks SO much for this recipe! It's irreplaceable and a definately keeper!!
470351,29184,2009-11-11,5,Excellent!  Swapped the balsamic and soy measurements and added 4 cloves of minced garlic.  Wonderful!
67270,29184,2010-04-25,5,"Mmmm... I made this to go with leftover Tipsy Chicken (#111894)  the other night, and it was marvelous. I nearly ate all the asparagus in one sitting (I refrained; the leftovers are good, too). Edited to add: This is my preferred method of serving asparagus, but I only roast it for 5-7 minutes."
904655,29184,2010-05-01,5,"I have tried your recipe many times... its for sure a KEEPER! very good... very simple.. delicious above all. thank you for posting!!!
I did go a little less time as i prefer my asparagus crispier.. but the mixture of ingredients are WONDERFUL!!"
383346,29184,2012-02-29,5,This is a great dressing to go with the roasted asparagus.  Great taste.  Thanks Angela :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
198154,29184,2018-03-24,3,"I sampled the asparagus when I took it out of the oven and it was good. However, I didn't care for it as much with the sauce. The rest of my family felt the same."
5060,13087,2002-03-18,5,"Eve, once again a great recipe!!  The best asparagus salad, the lime was wonderful with it and the asparagus had just the right amount of crispness!!  thank-you for sharing a wonderfull salad, we will do over and over again."
142335,13087,2009-03-20,0,I won't rate this since I messed it up. I subbed splenda for the sugar out of habit. Well you know how there are just some times when you shouldn't sub it? I think was one of those times. Will make again soon and follow recipe. Just wanted to post a picture for you!
220415,232950,2009-11-26,4,"Great sauce.  Especially for those of us who don't care for the taste of hot tomatoes.

Slathered on bbq'd chicken (that had been rubbed with paprika, brn sugar, s&p, and cayenne.  onderful for a 60 degree evening in late November in Colorado."
168462,145473,2005-11-22,5,This was a very good pie. I used the cream cheese option in the potatoes but next time to cut down on calories I will probably leave it out. I used a total of 2lb. of gr. beef and added a beef boullion cube to the mixture and left out the added salt. I also added a second boullion cube to the gravy for flavour. This was a very good recipe and easy to make. Thanks for the recipe. 
169969,145473,2006-07-06,5,This is a 5 for quick and easy! A definite stick to your ribs meal that my meat-N-potatoes DH2B loves! I used half ground beef and half cut up steak. This recipe was a life saver as the other meal I had planned had some problems and I needed something quick and yummy! thanks so much for posting!
88099,145473,2006-07-12,5,"OMG thanks so much for the quick and easy recipe.  I made this last night for my sister's family and everyone loved it.  I did use the vegetable broth in place of the cream, but other than that made as directed.  Thanks so much"
222139,145473,2006-07-13,5,Made this for dinner.  Used chicken broth in ours and  I through in some corn in ours.  Very easy to make. The family totaly enjoyed this.  Great also the second day for lunch. 
340576,145473,2006-10-29,5,"Wow, what an easy recipe! I was out of carrots so I added parsnips (peeled & sliced). Also added a drained can of corn for color. It was such a fast, simple meal to put together, and tasted so good that my kids didn't even complain about the veggies. A keeper!"
324621,145473,2007-05-11,3,"Not too terribly impressed with this one. It was okay, but I found it to be a bit bland. And although not very complicated to put together it was a bit time consuming between chopping the veggies and then tending to 3 pans cooking simultaneously on the stove. It was okay but just not something I think I will make again. Oh, and one more thing, I think some cheese would really help this dish out!"
335606,145473,2007-05-21,3,"This recipe was okay.  The first time I've made or had shepherd's pie.  I wasn't too impressed - kinda bland and boring.  I think I'll try a different recipe next time.  And this one would be easier just to use packaged gravy and instant potatoes and frozen veggies.  If I did that, it might be worth it.  But for all that work I just wasn't too impressed.  Thanks anyway, Rachel Ray!"
855621,145473,2011-04-28,5,"This was really good.  Instead of the mashed potatoes listed in the recipe, I topped the pie with leftover Colcannon (Recipe #285431) (mashed potatoes & cabbage), which I think made it even better.  The kids asked for it again - and even my husband, who usually thinks ""comfort food"" means ""bland"", thought this tasted great.  The worcestershire sauce was a great addition to the flavor."
729942,230530,2008-01-16,5,it was great
592481,230530,2011-07-20,5,I love raisin bread and nuts with cream cheese!  I'd suggest chopping the apples & celery quite small so the flavors can mix better.
157425,77709,2013-03-07,5,"DH enjoyed this dip! We also used Kaukauna brand cheese, bacon bits, and dried parsley. Refrigerated overnight and served with Frito Scoops. Easy dip to make and next time will add fresh parsley. Made and reviewed for the Game Forums Please Review My Recipe tag game."
1539571,429085,2011-07-09,4,"Really good but burns quickly when cooked on the BBQ. Next time, I will use the oven."
280271,429085,2012-01-05,5,I found this very delicious...I skipped the freezing part and went straight to the cooking...I did slip the thighs under the broiler for a few minutes to give them a more of crispy skin and to help brown them...This is very easy to prepare and I'm planning to make them again using the freezing method...thanks for posting.
557649,474258,2012-02-16,5,"Good and Plenty is one of the BEST Amish Restaurants in the Lancaster area.  And this is one of my FAVORITE dishes there.  I was born and raised in Gettysburg, PA, and went there many times.  This is an extremely easy recipe and GOOD recipe for its simplicity, like the Amish lifestyle.  I also do this with peeled, quartered potatoes too.  Browned Butter Potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe and the memories!"
219942,474258,2012-02-16,5,"You haven't lived until you've eaten browned butter noodles! I take the butter just to a medium brown color, and it smells so yummy and ""nutty!"" Fabulous!"
364211,474258,2012-02-16,5,"I knew I had to try this, after seeing it newly posted today.  So easy and simply GOOD!  Thanks so very much for sharing Bekah Balmer."
1365025,474258,2012-02-22,5,Had this for lunch today and was quite surprised how good it was. I eat a lot of buttered noodles but never heard of browning the butter. I will try this again now and then. Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag game.
369715,474258,2012-03-05,0,I'm not giving this stars because I am not sure if I did something wrong. I followed the recipe as written but we did not like the taste of these. We like buttered noodles but to us the browned butter didn't taste right to us. Not sure if it was the butter I used or what.
17803,474258,2012-11-06,4,"Oops, I browned the first batch of butter way to much and had to throw it out.  I did not turn the heat up as high the second time.  Just as it started to brown I took it off the heat.  I know I'd be changing the recipe a lot but I would like to add some garlic to the butter next time.   Made for Fall PAC 2012"
4439,474258,2012-11-09,5,"DH and I love this recipe. We used to make it all the time when we lived in Florida with Baked Chicken and steamed green beans. I have actually made the recipe with Gnocchi and it was great with the Gnocchi, too."
346514,474258,2013-03-18,5,"Delicious, easy. Thanks!"
330395,474258,2014-06-13,5,"Too, too easy. Love it! I had never thought of browning the butter first. Really adore the nuttiness it adds to the overall flavor. I also throw in a load of minced garlic (I don&#039;t measure, just a few heaping spoonfuls) when the butter&#039;s about halfway there so the garlic can brown a bit and flavor meld with the butter. Yum!"
54678,335812,2010-10-21,5,I am on an arugula kick right now and had an outdoor container of parsley to clean up plus spinach is always on hand in the fridge. This pesto rocks ....  the arugula adds that nice peppery bite...ooh la la!! Definite repeat for this household each harvest year
498271,272034,2010-04-08,5,I loved this salad!  I usually use vinegar to make dressing for a salad like this but loved it with the lemon juice and will make it that way from now on.  I had some pecans on hand so used them instead of the walnuts.  This made a great light lunch - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring PAC 2010
383346,272034,2010-07-07,5,I'm used to peel my apples so I did it.  I know it would look better with unpeel.  I omitted the salt.  This is a great salad.  Thanks for posting :)  Made for Cookbook tag game
162826,272034,2011-11-27,5,"5 stars, of course! Just like my Mom's, only she used red delicious apples for more color, so that what I used, too. :)<br/>Made for the ""A"" in let's PARTY event."
200862,476758,2012-10-17,5,"Bonnie, this is a truly wonderful breakfast or brunch dish! It should be ideal for B & B's! It is extremely tasty, and in fact between DH and me we almost ate all 6 muffins (2 are left, and he says it's his ""snack"" for later, cold or not!)  ... I can feel I had a really filling brunch!! Although I greased my muffin hollows well, I had a little trouble getting out the muffins.(I would advise using a nonstick muffin tin -- mine is not -- and still greasing it.)  The tastes are wonderful, and the cream and good cheddar are a must on these delicious bites. I used free-range eggs as you can see from the lovely orangey yolks. I think if one wants to double or even triple the recipe for a crowd, the rustic flattened bread ""baskets"" can be made ahead and kept airtight, and the bacon can be fried and crumbled the day before as well. Then the recipe will be extra easy to prepare in the morning. Thanks for a keeper -- this one is going straight to my Main cookbook. My muffins look somewhat ""rustic"" -- maybe the muffin hollows were a little small. BONNIE G WAS A RUNNER-UP IN THE ""DRESS A NAKED RECIPE"" PHOTO CONTEST IN THE FOOD PHOTO FORUM, SEPT. 2012. Congratulations, Bonnie!!"
128473,476758,2013-01-16,5,"Bonnie, what a winner of a recipe.  This simple to make breakfast treat was excellent. Quick, amazing flavors and textures.  I made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  All the flavors blend perfectly together to create a memorable meal.  Thanks so much for sharing.  My finished egg muffins didn't look so pretty because I had difficulty getting them out of the ramkins I used, but boy do they taste good.  Thanks for sharing a recipe that will be made again in my home.  This is a second and third repeater."
286566,476758,2013-03-02,5,"I've made this a few times now as the first time was a bit of a disaster as I used a regular size muffin pan which my slice of bread fitted perfectly but proved to be to small for the egg, bacon and cream so had to buy bread which is large sliced and used my texas muffin pan for delicious results and for breakfast I baked them so they were still runny but to take on a picnic I baked till the yolk was hard and were very much enjoyed, thank you Bonnie G #2, made for Rookie Recipes tag game."
126440,476758,2014-08-10,5,Loved these easy baked eggs.  Only made 4 but used ham for the bacon and honey for the maple syrup.  Very versatile will try as written when I get to the store.  Rally time and you don&#039;t go anywhere unless absolutely necessary.
51089,476758,2016-07-16,5,"Very good! I used English muffins instead of bread {only because my family prefers them}. It worked great. Like another reviewer, I used a Texas muffin pan. Next time I think I will try sausage and Swiss cheese. Can't wait! Thanks for posting."
21295,12478,2001-10-15,5,Was very good....gave it to my mom and she prepared it......Loved the taste.....
15385,12478,2001-11-01,5,How can you stop eating this lolllllll it is so good I need to make some more.....
5523,12478,2001-11-25,0,"Lycopene, a natural antioxidant found exclusively in tomatoes, is getting much attention in the press as a cancer fighter. In the early 1990s, tomatoes and tomato-based products were spotlighted as potentially preventive. In studies conducted at Harvard, 48,000 health professionals were followed for 6 years and monitored for evidence of prostate cancer. Researchers read the results to suggest that lycopene might decrease the risk of prostate cancer, whereas other dietary antioxidants, including beta-carotene, appeared to have no effect. In an observational study in Italy, tomatoes (a diet staple) had been consumed in significantly lower quantities before their illness by patients suffering from colorectal and other digestive tract cancers than by the healthy control group.

In a study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina, an association between heart health and tomatoes was seen. Fat samples drawn from heart attack sufferers and healthy controls were analyzed for lycopene and other carotenoids. There was significantly more lycopene in the fat of the controls than the heart patients. The diet of the controls was also higher in tomato products, suggesting that a lycopene-rich diet may have protected them against heart disease.

The method of tomato preparation seems to affect lycopene absorption. In a German study, researchers found that the lycopene blood levels were higher after ingestion of a heat-processed tomato product than after consuming uncooked tomatoes. The heat apparently disrupts the cell structure of the tomato, making the lycopene more available. Caution is indicated, however, against extracting lycopene or any compound from tomatoes and administering it separately; tomatoes are rich in vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and other phytochemicals that may work together to exert these effects."
57101,12478,2003-08-11,3,"Pretty good.  With all the 5 star ratings, I was expecting a little more.  I will probably use this recipe as a base for a pasta sauce when I have an abundance of banana peppers.  "
4470,12478,2004-08-31,5, The flavor is great however having a lot of peppers in the garden I added 3 Jalapeno peppers. Used fresh Cherry tomatoes and 1/2 cup of tomatoe juice. It was so easy using my mini chopper to chop the peppers and the onions.. I poured it boiling hot into a sterilized jar and it sealed. I got just over 1 pint.  Will be wonderful on my Saturday night burger and also as Pasta sauce.  A great condiment. I love to use some of those peppers creatively Thanks Dave. I hope you think the photos do the recipe justice
414666,12478,2007-07-22,4,i thought this was sensational!
437727,12478,2008-07-27,5,"Oh, MY! 
I followed as closely as I could with two exceptions.... didn't have enough banana peppers so used an ancho and a jalapeno. Also, used Muir Glen fire-roasted diced tomatoes and about a cup or two of the many cherry tomatoes that are overwhelming me right now.... This is incredible alone, I cannot wait to try it on fish, poultry, .... everything! I'm going to attempt to freeze, too!
Thanks, Dave!"
369715,191700,2007-09-28,4,Wow what a great taste. I did make some changes though. I didn't add the butter and I only added about 1/4 of the dry onion soup packet. It had a great taste. Will be making again. Made for Fall PAC 2007.
86512,191700,2008-04-14,4,"This was very good. I thought the onion/butter mixture would be strong because there was no other liquid besides the melted butter, but it wasn't strong at all  I baked it at 375 because I don't like my cheese brown  I had it with Recipe #234128I will be making this again. Thank you Nanny for sharing your recipe. Made for PAC Spring 2008."
136997,191700,2008-04-15,4,"I microwaved the asparagus for about 4 min. instead of steaming them. I  only used about 2 tbsp. of butter and water as well as only about 3 tbsp. of the onion soup mix. I just couldn't bring myself to add that much fat and salt. I did make up for it though in the amount of cheese. LoL! I must have put at least 2 cups on top and baked it the last 15 min. along with my pork chops at 350 degrees. Delicious! 
Made for PAC Spring '08. :)"
704950,353855,2009-02-10,5,Yummy and easy!!!  I sprinkled a bit of kosher salt and pepper along with the oil.  This is the perfect oven temp and baking time for a 1/2 inch slice of portobello.  These tasted great!!!!!
573325,420376,2011-06-09,5,"YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! This is such a great recipe! The pudding comes out creamy, thick and full of flavour! Mmm, the honey is the perfect addition! Who would have thought that avocado and banana are such a dream team? :)<br/>I accidentally forgot to use the milk at first, but it was still yummy. However after realising my mistake I added the milk and it was so much better. <br/>I cant wait to try the ice cream version of this. <br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this keeper with us, rainbowapronblackballoon!"
336540,17427,2007-01-15,4,"I had to cook these for a lot longer than 35 min, but they were Really good with Ranch and Ketsup!  Thank you went really good with the Mushroom, Bacon, burgers:)"
605866,17427,2008-01-05,5,"I was about ready to add this recipe! This is our favorite way to eat red potatoes! I use minced garlic instead of garlic powder sometimes. And when I'm really craving garlic, I use both. The baking time is also a lot longer than 35 min. Just keep checking on them and stirring. You'll know when they're ready. Heaven!"
421374,17427,2008-01-21,5,"Mmm...tasty! I loved the spices on this one! I agree with the other reviewers in that it did take me longer to cook mine. Mine were a tad thicker and it took about 50 minutes total cooking time. Next time I make this, maybe I'll put it at 450 or something."
508148,17427,2008-11-04,5,"This has been a family favorite for years!  My kids love these and don't mind at all that they don't have that fried taste.  Sometimes, I omit the olive oil and just spray the potatoes with non stick cooking spray before adding the seasoning."
1321271,17427,2009-07-11,5,Bravo! So simple and the kids can't get enough. We splashed on a dash of cayane just for kicks. Thank You
58038,34484,2007-07-28,4,Very easy with a subtle taste.  We didn't cook as long as in instructions as they were done sooner.
27381,34484,2002-07-30,5,"This is so very good! I loved it. I had a very large homegrown zucchini that I sliced on the bias and I used a tomatoey Italian dressing. I let the zucchini sit in the dressing for a little while before I barbequed it. I cooked it a bit longer than necessary, perhaps, but I enjoyed the lightly burnt crusty parts. It was really very easy, fast and delicious! However, my non-zucchini-eating husband and son didn't like it. Oh what a shame....more for me! :-) I'm uploading a picture, too, so you can see how pretty the grill mark look!"
22015,34484,2002-08-07,4,We used the yellow zucchini - great taste.  Thanks for posting.
27395,34484,2004-04-30,5,"It just doesn't get any easier (or yummy) than this!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and added some black pepper and garlic powder (instinct;). Grilled on my George Foreman and served with grilled chicken breast marinated in Italian dressing and some rice pilaf on the side. Meal in a flash!! Thanks so much for posting!
~Manda"
185285,34484,2005-04-15,4,Pretty good!  I'd go a bit heavier with the Italian Dressing - the grill takes most (if not all) of the taste unless you really are generous!
121684,34484,2006-11-15,5,"This made a lovely light side-dish to serve with pork chops.  I used Paul Newman's Caesar Dressing (not the creamy one).  I sliced a large zucchini on the diagonal and let it sit for a while in the dressing, before grilling on the stove-top in a ridged grill pan.  Just delicious.  Can't wait to try it on the barbecue."
172884,34484,2007-04-20,5,I was looking for a quick & simple recipe for zucchini to go with the steaks we were just about to grill. I wanted something healthy so I didn't want to saute it and this fit the bill. I used fat-free Italian dressing since that's all I had. I didn't even bother measuring it - just put the sliced zukes in a bowl and poured it on. Then I basted them with the leftover dressing while they grilled. Delicious and healthy! Thanks M&Mers for a great idea.
340130,34484,2007-06-29,5,We really liked this. I used the Foreman grill - nice change from the usual steamed or broiled. Thanks.
534709,34484,2007-07-13,5,"This was great.  The only zucchini I have ever liked was cut thin and fried or in zucchini bread.  I just cooked one zucchini as a sample, convinced before I ever put it on the grill that no one would like it, boy was I wrong.  My inlaws came for dinner and everyone only got a taste which definately wasn't enough. Thanks so much for such a great recipe it is definately a keeper!"
59780,63887,2003-09-11,5,Yummy! First I prepared the potatoes using recipe#59353 and then I served this on the side. I did add 2 tablespoons of bacon bits for a little extra flavour. I will definitely make this topping again--it tastes like twice baked potatoes without all the work! Thanks for this great recipe!
82367,63887,2003-10-10,5,"This stuff was great!! I too did as Pamela In Winnipeg, and prepared my potatoes using recipe #59353-""Awesome Simple Baked Potatoes"" by wildhorse. I took Pamela's lead and also added some bacon, I used 3 slices of cooked & crumbled since I happened to have some in the fridge. I would however also try the bacon bits in the future for some crunch and or if I didn't happen to have any real bacon on hand. I also added some garlic powder and some freshly cracked black pepper. I used chives from my little garden as I did not have any green onions. Using these two recipes together made for one of the best baked potatoes we have had in awhile! We will definitely be making this topping again!! Thanks lucy k.!"
36944,63887,2004-07-11,5,This was quick to prepare and tasted great!  I did add some coarse ground pepper to my mixture.  Besides the wonderful taste I liked the fact that you could prepare this ahead of time and have everything in one dish ready to prepare your potatoes with.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe with us lucy k.
51011,63887,2006-08-17,5,Yum!!! Made about 1/4 of this tonight for me to put on a baked potato.  This would be great to have on hand for a potluck or something :).  Wonder how long this would keep?  Thanks for sharing!
124249,63887,2006-09-05,5,"This was a quick and easy topping for our baked potato. Pretty much everything has already been said except we liked it.

Thanks lucy k. 

Bullwinkle."
108843,63887,2006-09-14,5,"I made this, as is for a dip for some low sodium fries. It worked great! I can see that I will be using this recipe as a base for a lot of future needs, besides dipping fries. Next time,I will add a chopped garlic clove, and maybe some finely chopped onions, but, that is for personal preference. Thank you so much, lucy k for posting this keeper.
jim"
103876,63887,2007-01-22,5,Wow!  What a simple concept and so good!  My kids liked this so much that they were eating it as dip with crackers.  I'm sure I will make this whenever we have baked potatoes again.  We also added some bacon bits on top.  Thanks for posting!
386849,63887,2007-11-21,5,"What an awesome idea! I love the fact that I can just have 1 bowl of topping out- it saved on clean up time. I added some garlic salt (about 1/2 tsp) and it didnt need additional salt. The only thing that I would make note of is that this is more like 3 servings for my family of big eaters. Thanks, Lucy!"
663171,63887,2008-11-03,5,i loved this idea also! I added the garlic salt from munchkin mama's review-also a good idea-thanks to both of u!
650938,63887,2009-02-10,5,Yum!  So easy and yet it added so much to my potato.  I don't know if I'll ever eat a potato without it again.  I made it with this potato recipe http://www.recipezaar.com/Awesome-Simple-Baked-Potatoes-59353
407007,63887,2009-06-21,5,"All of my favorite baked potato toppings - never thought to mix them and add them but WOW! This was great! I added bacon bits to the mix and used all light ingredients, but followed exactly. Thanks for sharing - will use this a lot! I used Recipe #53182 for the potatoes."
305531,63887,2010-01-07,5,Yummy! This was really simple and was great to make ahead of time and refrigerate until dinner. Thanks lucy k for a nice new treat. Made for Cookbook Tag.
140132,63887,2010-04-07,5,"This is great!  We always use each of these ingredients for our baked potatoes.  This helps keeps each individual container off our table, uses less space.  We really liked the whole concept of the idea and it tasted great too.  I will make double next time and keep in fridge.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe withus."
41578,91644,2004-06-01,5,"You are so right, we didn't want to come up for air.  This is an awesome cheese pound cake and my guests devoured it.  I was VERY lucky to get a taste. It's very easy to put together.  This will be making a repeat performance.  Thanks so much, Jeff Hixson.  (Another winner).
"
94621,91644,2004-06-13,5,this is the perfect pound cake...easy to make...difficult to stop eating...i added a few moments to the baking time to give a little more golden coloring. This is a cake i would make when i want to impress...you gotta try it!
41809,91644,2004-06-15,5,"That kid of yours has excellent taste in recipes, J!  This one is awesome!  Very easy to mix up and ignore for an hour and a 1/2! Makes a huge bundt cake pan-full, and so I added whip cream and fresh strawberries on top!  Deeeelish!!
Thanks Amanda ... you've shared an elegant dessert!  Laudee"
141161,91644,2004-06-27,5,"This case is terrific, very moist, not too sweet, perfect.  I'm now getting special requests from people asking me to bake this cake.  I don't mind because it is easy to put together and to bake.  People think you have gone to a lot of trouble just for them.  A+ recipe.  "
36944,91644,2004-06-30,5,"I was going to make a couple of these pound cakes to take to a July 4th pool party, along with cool whip, strawberries and blueberries, to stay with the patriotic theme, when I realized I have never reviewed it.  This is a quick and easy cake to make that results in a wonderfully delicious and moist pound cake.  Eat it alone or with your favorite toppings.  It's good however you fix it!  This is obviously a keeper in my house since I've obviously already made it in the past.  Gotta go preheat the oven and start baking....."
55224,91644,2004-07-13,5,Made as instructed and it came out beautifully.  Very dense and moist like a poundcake should be.  Served it first as base for strawberry shortcake and later under peaches and cream.  I think the peaches were even better!  Great plain too.  Thanks for a keeper.
67741,91644,2004-07-17,5,"This cake not only tastes wonderful, but looks beautiful!  Excellent texture. Be careful not to overcook.  Super recipe!"
125325,91644,2004-07-23,5,"This is amazing!! Served it with strawberries and cream, but my family prefers it plain. Amanda you have great taste!! Thank you!"
529049,91644,2008-02-13,4,"Great cake!  The smell from the oven was out of this world!  It looked beautiful, too.  I have had better pound cakes, but this one was a real treat!"
58538,91644,2004-10-02,5,"This cake was great. I made it for a birthday at work. Everyone loved it. I served it lightly dusted with powdered sugar. It was dense, but not heavy and moist. The cream cheese gave it a great flavor, but it did not taste ""cream cheesey"".  It did take longer to bake than stated, but could definitly be my oven. I just used the toothpick test."
59728,91644,2004-12-27,5,Awsome recipe!!!  Incredible pound cake that my whole family loved.  Served it at Christmas after baking it in a tube pan.  I then sliced it in half horizontally and iced it with a lime cream cheese frosting (instead of a typical lemon cc frosting).  My father who loves food (and never gains a pound like myself) said it was the best tasting dessert there not to mention the best pound cake he's ever had.  First pound cake that didn't give me heartburn :-)Way to go Jeff!!!  Your daughter made a wonderful discovery!
31364,91644,2005-02-02,5,"This took nearly 2 1/2 hours to bake at 300 degrees, and I used two smaller pans. This was delicious though, and the ""crust"" was just unbelivable. We had it with whip cream & cherries, and then the next day plain!"
76007,91644,2005-03-27,5,I made this and took it to my aunt's house for Easter and it was a huge hit! This is my first attempt at a pound cake and I was surprised at how easy it was. 
135470,91644,2005-05-25,3,"This was easy to make and the batter was delicious, but I was a bit disappointed in the end result. It took over two hours to cook and even then it might have used a little more. To me the texture is slightly gummy (fortunately my DH loves that). The flavor is ok,it just didn't taste like poundcake to me."
215069,91644,2005-06-07,5,This cake is an absolute dream to make and eat!
61178,91644,2005-07-08,0,the best ilb cake i have ever made. very moist and very good with strawberrys
207157,91644,2005-07-15,5,"yummy yummy -- nice texture. I changed the recipe just a little because I wanted an almond pound cake. I substituted 1/2 tsp. almond and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract for the 1 tsp. vanilla called for in the recipe. I toasted some slivered almonds and stirred one cup into the batter just before pouring it into the pan. To toast almonds, preheat oven to 400 degF and put slivered almonds in a single layer on baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, turning over halfway through.
I brought the pound cake to work and the cake is almost gone!"
186487,91644,2005-07-21,5,"Fast, easy, delicious.  I added lemon zest, although I couldn't really taste it and might add more next time (this is just fine on its own, but I love lemon).    I got a 7-inch tube pan plus two loaf pan's worth from this recipe, although I might have been able to get one taller loaf instead of two flattish ones if I'd just used a single loaf pan along with the tube pan.  I adjusted to about 70 minutes of cooking time.  Thanks!"
180486,91644,2005-07-30,5,"This was very good, I didn't change a thing!"
194990,91644,2005-08-24,0,"hi..
I made this pound cake twice now and I must be doing something wrong because it looks like it is not done but when I did the toothpick thing it was good..the first time I threw it out, but I am not doing it this time...what happened!!!!!"
147175,91644,2005-09-14,4,"After 2 hours in the oven it was finally cooked and not gooey. In your instructions it didn't mention to grease the bundt pan, I however did and was glad I did. I now know why it's called pound cake, I had to pound it out of my pan..lol I can only imagine if I hadn't greased the pan first. So needless to say the end result was pretty good, but to be honest I wouldn't make it again it wasn't worth the 2 hour cooking time. Thanks Jeff for the recipe, it's always good to try something new."
49152,91644,2005-09-24,0,"I followed instrustions to the tee.  The cake over flowed in my oven and did not turn out very well.  I might try again, at this point I don't know...."
284285,91644,2006-01-16,4,its good!
332964,91644,2006-08-21,5,Very Nice INDEED! Thanks for the recipe one of the best I have had and extremely easy to make!!! Could hardly wait for the whole 1 1/2 hrs bake time .. lol!!! A Keeper;)  
192623,91644,2006-10-09,5,"What a wonderful cake!  Made it for a party and they snorked it right up!  Pretty easy to make, once the butter and cream cheese soften.  Thanks for sharing - will ABSOLUTELY be making this again!"
246367,91644,2006-10-25,5,"So rich and yummy.Be sure to cut a tiny slice,this is a rich wonderful cake."
161265,91644,2006-11-20,5,"Soooo yummy.  And simple to make.  What more could you want?  Thanks for the great recipe, Jeff!"
191047,91644,2006-12-19,5,"I LOVE this cake, I have been making it for a while now and noticed I havent reviewed it! Thank you for a fabulous dessert. Hey...if anyone tries it with fat free or low fat cream cheese,please review it and let us know how it works out!"
53267,91644,2007-02-02,5,This was my first attempt at a pound cake and it was FANTASTIC!  Made it and poof it was gone...everytime anyone passed by it..one more piece gone.  I followed the recipe exactley and it turned out great.  Definitely a keeper!
447123,91644,2007-02-08,5,WOW what else can I say but yummy. THis really can't get any easier!!! I used 2 regular size loaf pans. One was saved to eat now. ANd the other was put in the freezer. It freezes well and when you defrost it just put it on the counter and is just as good as fresh baked. You have GOT to make this.............. you won't be sorry.
154832,91644,2008-04-06,5,Fantastic! Great flavor and easy to make. I cooked it an additional 5 minutes just to be sure and it was perfect.
424331,91644,2007-02-26,5,"Someone once told me that the reason why it's called a pound cake is because there's literally a pound of butter in the recipe.  Well worth the calorie count.  This was a super moist cake and goes very well with milk, tea, coffee.  I added 2 tsp. of lemon extract to my batter in addition to the vanilla.  Served with lemon spice tea, it was a great afternoon treat."
120602,91644,2007-03-17,5,"Like everyone else, I loved this pound cake! I made 2 loaf pans instead of the Bundt so I could freeze one for later. This is so tender and flavorful - you really don't need to serve it with any toppings at all but I imagine it would be an amazing base for a trifle! My 2 loaf pans took about 1 hour 20 minutes to cook and about as long to eat! :0)"
99296,91644,2007-03-31,5,"Fabulous recipe! I've been using this recipe for years from an old Southern cookbook I got before I was married. The only change is I use 2 tsp vanilla, or sometimes I'll use 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond. It freezes great, well-wrapped. I usually make it in loaf pans so I have one to eat and oen to freeze. Thanks for posting this!"
363398,91644,2007-04-11,4,"Thanks for a super pound cake. Would of given it a 5 star, but had trouble getting it out of the bundt pan. Was wondering if anyone else did? You wouldn't think with all that butter in there that it would stick some, but it did. Other than that SUPER. Thanks for sharing."
468015,91644,2007-05-08,5,WOW!! I made this cake for a friend of mine and my family tackled me to the ground! Looks like I need to make another one. My husband said to give this six stars. Super easy.
365368,91644,2007-05-11,2,"I really wanted to like it, but it still tasted raw after baking 2.5 hours and was far too moist for a cully cooked cake. It looked gorgeous though. Perhaps I went wrong somewhere with my flour. I'm going to try again."
322603,91644,2007-05-29,5,"Absolutely, excellent recipe!!! I made this for my family and they LOVED it. I couldn't help getting seconds. Only thing next time, I will make sure to make this when I have company over because I could never make this again if it's just us because I practically ate it all. Scrumptious!!!!!..... UPDATE, I am back again. I made this tonight LOWFAT style, low fat butter, fat free cream cheese, Splenda Sugar for baking, egg beaters. As I was making it, I was praying it would taste great and it actually tastes GREAT without the guilt! I really enjoyed your recipe but I'm trying to keep my favorite recipes but Lowfat style. Still 5 stars!!!!!
-Ruthy"
222055,91644,2007-08-18,4,"This tasted really good. I would have liked clearer instructions like to prepare the pan or not, or to leave in the pan after cooking or not. I also baked for two hours and I had a slight undone spot in the cake. Also my top crusted hard and practically fell off the whole cake when it was cut. It tasted much better after refridgeration. Thank you Jeff, and if you add the needed info, I will gladly make this 5 stars."
473347,91644,2007-08-30,5,"You are an evil, evil person! Ruining my diet by posting this. I ate the whole thing (by myself) in less than 3 days. Now I did halve the recipe, which turned out great. Like another person said the top did turn out hard and fell off when I cut it. I ended up baking it for 2 hours and it was perfectly done. Next time I think I will try adding a bit less sugar as it was a tiny bit to sweet for me. And up the cream cheese as I LOVE cream cheese. 
Thank you for this amazing recipe I can't wait to try it again."
551470,91644,2007-09-04,5,"Simply wonderful but much too sweet for me. I added 2.5 cup and it was still too sweet! :) The cake came out great though! I used magarine instead of butter and extra light cream cheese. Came out perfect! Very nice cake, thank you!"
581920,91644,2007-09-07,5,"I was looking for an easy pound cake recipe after finding a more labor/ingredient intensive recipe in ""The Joy of Cooking"".  After reading the reviews, I had to try it!  I halved the ingredients simply b/c I only have one loaf pan.  It turned out PERFECTLY!  This is an incredible poundcake recipe.  The texture is perfect - dense, but not heavy.  Almost velvety.  Some reviewers found it too sweet, but I didn't think that it was too sweet at all.  I actually doubled up on the vanilla, but I may try lemon next time instead, just as a variation.  I didn't time it, but I would say cooking time is definitely between 1.5-2 hours.  Make sure to butter and flour the pan, and when it's finished, allow it to cool for 5-10 minutes in the pan, or until it pulls away from the sides.  Then the cake will fall right out of the pan without sticking.  I will probably use this recipe for the rest of my life - so easy and sooooooooo good.  Thanks, Jeff!"
580430,91644,2007-10-09,3,"Disappointing.  I followed this recipe to a T, and did not get the results I had anticipated.  The cake did not rise, and the top separated from the cake and cracked as the rest of the cake sank in.  It tastes extremely yummy and dense, but the results were not as I hoped them to be.  Was this because of the lack of baking powder or soda?  Or just a fluke mess-up?"
602163,91644,2007-11-18,4,"I thought the cake had a nice taste and texture, but I could not tell if it was done or not because the cake looked two-tone, which I'm guessing was the creme cheese.  I baked for 1 1/2 hours.  It appeared fully baked other than the swirls which I hope was just the creme cheese and not evidence of an under baked cake.  I also used only 2 cups sugar rather than 3.  I thought it was sweet enough with only 2."
380611,91644,2007-12-21,1,"I made this cake exactly as written, but when I took it out of the pan, it fell.  I cut it right after taking it out of the pan, and it wasn't done (even though the toothpick I used to check it came out clean)!  I put it back in the pan and baked it another 45 minutes, but was unable to salvage it, it was sad all the way through.  Luckily I was baking it just for the family, rather than planning on taking it somewhere."
324386,91644,2007-12-26,4,This cake was very good my 3 year old son would not leave it alone I had to lock it in the oven because he kept trying to sneak more :)
581040,91644,2007-12-28,5,"This pound cake tasted great, my family and I really enjoyed it.   I followed the directions exactly as written, however it was not cooked all the way.  I didn't realize this until I had already sliced it up.  There was an area about the size of a half dollar that was still doughy.  We just pulled this part off and ate the rest and it was delicious.  I will try this again and bake it another 15 minutes.  Thank's for sharing!"
146486,91644,2008-04-15,5,Fantastic!  I have made this so many times over the years and everyone ALWAYS loves it.  I do lighten it up a bit by using light margarine and fat free cream cheese and the taste still turns out fabulous.  Thanks so much for a real keeper!
158725,91644,2008-04-15,4,"This cake is absolutely delicious! Mine cracked when I turned it out, I'll chalk that up to my fault plus a brand new ceramic bundt pan. 
No matter! Sliced and topped with pureed peach sauce nobody could tell."
822760,91644,2008-05-09,5,"Oh my gosh, this is an amazing cake!  I followed the recipe exactly (well, I added a touch more vanilla) and trusted the 1.5 hour baking time.  When I took the cake out of the oven it was BEAUTIFUL!  I let it cool for a couple of minutes, then turned it out onto a plate without any trouble.  I served it topped with whipped cream (from a recipe on this site as well).  My husband and kids (and I) all proclaimed it as the best pound cake we'd ever had!"
360241,91644,2008-05-26,5,"This was awesome! I took it to a gathering of friends, and one of the adults called over to my table in front of everybody to tell me it was the best pound cake he had ever eaten! I 'frosted'  it with cool whip and put slices of strawberry on top. 
I highly recommend this cake!"
808027,91644,2008-07-07,5,"This entire cake disappeared the same day it was made (my neighbors inhaled a good portion of it!).  Being from the South, I added 1 tsp. each of almond, lemon and orange...we Southerns tend to be into multi-flavor pound cakes.  This is our new favorite pound cake recipe and is going in my ""favorites"" cookbook."
164913,91644,2008-07-07,5,"This was REALLY good! I'm not much of a pound cake person, but I made it for a bake sale at work.  After 4 people came back to tell me how good it was, I decided to give it a try.  Wow!  I will be making this at home for myself now! Thanks for a great recipe!"
108043,91644,2008-07-15,5,"Wonderful recipe!!!  Mine had to bake an additional 10 minutes using a tube pan.  
I also thickened some blueberries and spooned some over each thin slice before serving.  The richness of this pound cake, along with the slight tartness of the blueberries made for a fantastic dessert. This recipe is so easy, delicious (be sure not to substitute margarine for the butter - it won't taste as good) and the base for any fruit or a stand alone with just a dusting of powdered sugar. Thanks for sharing."
394077,91644,2008-07-21,5,This recipe is very similar to my Southern Living Recipe.  The only difference is that mine uses 1 Tablespoon vanilla and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Excellent recipe.
667906,91644,2008-09-07,5,"Easy recipe!!!!!

I hosted a party yesterday and my guests loved my pound cake.  Thank you so much for sharing."
178742,91644,2008-09-12,5,"OMG! THEE BEST POUND CAKE I've ever made! Took it to a 40th birthday party for my cousin, and everyone ABSOLUTELY loved it... I hated to say how much butter and eggs were in it.. but no one cared. I used Recipe #118866 for the lemon glaze to go over the pound cake. It too was very good. The only change I made, and not because I wanted to.. I only had margarine. Oh my, can you imagine how much better with real butta! Next time for sure! I also took others suggestions, and I baked it 15 minutes longer than directions called for. It probably would not have been done all the way if I followed the directions. Still came out moist. It was just so decadent! I love it! Thanks for sharing!"
817200,91644,2008-12-17,5,"This cake is SO good and SO easy...not to mention- impossible to mess up! I have already made it twice and plan on making it for my xmas office party. You really cannot go wrong! 
Does anyone know what the recipe would be if I used a 13 X 9 cake pan? I am really bad at estimating!!! Thanks"
469107,91644,2008-12-27,5,"OMG!!  This cake is sooo good and sooo moist!  I thought I found my favorite pound cake recipe years before with 7-up pound cake.  I can now throw that recipe in the trash.  The only thing I did different was, I greased and floured the bundt pan.  Thank You much, Mr Hixson (and Amanda) for sharing"
1020416,91644,2009-01-01,4,This is a very nice Pound cake. It came together easily and is just wonderful. Thank you for posting this recipe.
218535,91644,2009-01-01,5,Best pound cake ever.
467741,91644,2009-01-14,5,Super good!  This is an amazing pound cake.  Velvety and moist.  I froze half of it and ate the rest practically by myself!
514761,91644,2009-01-17,5,Awesome texture and very moist!  Loved the kind of crusty crunch of the top and edges!  Excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing this one!
80353,91644,2009-02-27,5,"What a simply fabulous cake!  I made it slightly less sweet (used 2 1/2 cups of sugar) and I think I would go down to 2 next time.  Added some orange zest for added flavour and that was a good call for us, too.  Love the crunchy, crumbly topping (I kept picking at it).  Thawed some strawberry sauce I had in the freezer and we really enjoyed it with the bright red sauce and a little dollop of whipped cream.  This dessert really is awesome and I highly recommend you try it."
460048,91644,2009-03-01,5,Excellent recipe - so moist! I also had to bake mine longer - 15 minutes longer but it was worth the wait!!
446941,91644,2009-03-26,5,"Ive made this many times and thought I already reviewed it. This also makes 2 Loaf pans and they dont stick around long! My family loves this, from the batter to the last crumbs- We can demolish this in two days just by picking at it. Goes wonderfully well with sugared strawberries!"
256021,91644,2009-04-11,5,this is great for a pot-luck or to make dessert for a crowd.  we also make this in 2 loaf pans and it's great alone or with fruit.  if i'm making it just for my family i freeze one of the loafs for later.
1236101,91644,2009-04-12,5,Really incredible cake that everyone loved!  I wanted to see if it would freeze well but it didn't stick around long enough.  I greased the bundt pan I was using and I don't know if it would come out of the pan otherwise.
709625,91644,2009-04-30,5,"What a gorgeous recipe.  I have made it twice now.  The only substitution I have done is used my hard wheat, freshly ground as the flour.  It gives the cake a feeling of body but retains all the lightness.  I recommend this recipe with all I've got!!!  A +++"
565041,91644,2009-05-04,5,"I found this recipe in a magazine- the only difference in ingredients was  2 3/4 c sugar and addition of 1/2 tsp salt (oh, and cake flour).  There were VERY specific mixing instructions.. I think they were not necessary given these reviews!!  I made 2 loaf pans, baked for 1 hour 15 minutes.  GREAT texture and flavor."
387442,91644,2009-05-23,5,"Yum! Cooked up nicely in a silicone sunflower shaped pan.  Moist, dense, and soft!  Worked great as the base to a bowl of limoncello infused berries and whipped cream.  Excellent summer cake!"
633722,91644,2009-06-01,5,I made this for Easter and my family devoured it. I used a fluted pan and the cake didn't come out cleanly (my fault) so I cut it into cubes and layered it in a trifle bowl with whipped cream and mashed berries. Had plenty of plain cake left over for snacking too. I'm having a dinner party soon and am planning on making this again and drizzling it with Jeni's Chocolate Ganache (#97213)
76951,91644,2009-06-10,5,"Very, very good.  I made this in a bundt pan for a friend who had complications after surgery.  I sifted powdered sugar on top of it.  This makes a big cake, so I'm sure she didn't even miss the amount I took out to make 4 cupcakes for DH and me.  The cake was out of this world.  For simplicity and taste, I'd give it 10 stars!  I loved it."
1062870,91644,2009-06-27,5,Yum!!!!!  This pound cake was so easy and moist.  I love it!  My husband told me that his grandmother (who is the worlds best baker) would be proud.  The only thing I did differently was add 1/2 tsp. extra vanilla and stir the flour in by hand as to not add too much air.  I think it makes a big difference when making pound cake.  Make this...you won't be disappoited!  :)
240552,91644,2009-06-30,5,"Superb pound cake and yet so easy!! I used 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening. I also used some double strength vanilla. It came out so moist and full of flavor! Thank you for posting. Made this for the Cake-A-Thon in memorial for Chef-I-Am.
6/30/09 Made again and used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup unbleached flour and again doubled the vanilla.  It was great!"
85018,91644,2009-07-19,5,"Great cake and simple to make--what more could anyone want.  
I baked it in two 9""x5"" pans and baked for 1 hour.  I added 1 Tsp. of orange extract along with the vanilla.  I froze one of the loaves and used the other to make a raspberry triffle for DD2's b-day dinner-----everyone loved it! Such rich yumminess!  Way to go Jeff!"
616211,91644,2009-08-13,4,"Made this cake for the guys at the firehouse and they said it was ""good"" but that it needed ""something"".  I agree: I added 2 tsp of vanilla as opposed to 1 but that was the only change I made. I served it warm, so maybe cooling it off would give it a better mouth feel.  I served it plain, so next time I will try it wiht blueberry compote or strawberries.  Thanks for the decadent recipe!"
1102668,91644,2009-08-16,5,"If you know pound cake, you know this is a good one!  It was perfect.  Dense, moist, and buttery.  I served it with strawberries and whipped cream.  It is wonderful toasted with butter the next day.  I wouldn't change a thing."
140379,91644,2010-01-25,5,"This is an amazing cake, totally worth the time and effort!!  I needed to cook it longer, probably about an hour and 45 mins, but it was perfect.  Served it with a homemade lemon curd, and it was a great finish to a meal.  Thanks for sharing!!"
449500,91644,2010-02-23,5,"This recipe is terrific! My husband got me a KitchenAid Mixer for Christmas and this pound cake recipe comes together so quickly with it! This is the second time I have made this. Tonight, I had only about 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, so I subbed in brown sugar for the rest....fantastic flavor! And since I was lazy, I used two glass loaf pans instead of a tube/budnt pan. I baked it for 60 mintues, checked it, and then for another 20ish minutes.  It's really, really important to have your butter, cream cheese, and eggs room temperature...it created a not-quite-so-dense batter that was easier to work with.  Thanks for the sharing the recipe!"
837304,91644,2010-03-02,5,Very easy cake to make. I took it to work and co-workers said it was the best pound cake they had ever eaten!! I made one change: I added 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract. It really rounded out the flavor. I'm throwing away all of my other pound cake recipes.
527016,91644,2010-04-14,5,"I bought a book called 101 Things To Do Before You are Old and Boring.  ""Learn to bake a cake"" is on my list and this is the recipe I choose! It was great (even though my beaters broke and I had to hand cream everything) Since it was my first attempt eer at a bundt cake, I stuck to the recipe exactly.  My eggs were jumbo and my cream cheese was 1/3 the fat I think!  Since I had to buy a pan, I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the reminder to grease and flour the pan! And thanks Amanda for the great find!"
665211,91644,2010-04-21,5,my first attempt at making a pound cake and it was wonderful and moist.  only thing i added was the almond extract extra but i am sure it would have been great with out it as well.  thanks so much for the recipe jeff i will be making again and again
425803,91644,2010-05-07,5,"Absolutely fantastic!  Another first timer for making pound cake.  Rave reviews from my family. I didn't change a thing and it turned out perfect. We served it sliced with thawed mixed berries and a big dollop of cool whip on top.  
Even my picky 12 year old son cleaned off his plate. 
 Tried and true recipes books like those are my favorites too.
If I could give it more then 5 stars, I would. 
This will definitely be a keeper in our house.  Thank you so much for sharing."
798586,91644,2010-05-24,5,this is a definite keeper!! My husband had an almost 40 bday. He dosent like sweet cakes so i made this one. He loved it! eats it for breakfast with coffee. Its really an anytime cake. Thanks so much. I will make this often!
254183,91644,2010-05-28,4,"I know that after 85 rave reviews an 86th is no longer necessary but I can't help myself! My cake has just been turned out after spending exactly 11/2 hours in the oven. The batter was so thick that some air bubbles got stuck so it's a bit pockmarked, but these will be easily hidden by frosting (but I'm not sure this cake actually needs any). I couldn't help cutting off the teeniest but of crust from what is now the bottom of the cake and it's delish. The taste of the crumb is also very good, I can definitely see how the cream cheese contributes . I have to admit that I added alot of flavouring (2T. plus 2t. and 2t. of almond) but as far and I can tell it's good. Also I was very very nervous about there not being any leavening agent in this cake, but it rose up pretty good and it's not  overly dense. I decided to butter and flour my bundt pan even though it has a nonstick coating and the cake slid right out. My BF (I'm not sure what the other Zaar abbreviations stand for) says that the cake is very sweet, but that's why it's good. I will post an update once I've actually had a mouthful of the cake, but you're already getting cheers from me..."
704939,91644,2010-05-31,5,"This was too simple to make to come out tasting this great. I subbed 1/3 less cream cheese, lowered the sugar to 2 1/2 cups (would even use 2 cups next time) used I Can't Believe it's Not Butter sticks, and Egg Beaters because my mother is watching her cholesterol. I needn't have worried about all of the subs because as stated above, the cake was phenominal. I baked using 2 large loaf pans; checking the cake after an hour and 10 minutes I saw that the edges browned nicely but the middle was still a bit doughy. I had begun with a 320 degree oven, lowered the temp to 300, put them in for another 15 minutes, then turned off the oven and left them in for another 10 and they came out perfect, inside and out. Granted, everyone's stoves are different, but I would begin checking slightly before the recommended bake time and make adjustments accordingly."
810787,91644,2010-06-10,5,Wow! This is so moist and rich. I LOVED it! I took it to work for the last day of school and it was a BIG hit! I used a spring form pan and didn't care for that. Next time I'll use a bundt.
327503,91644,2010-06-22,5,"This pound cake is amazing! It is rich and moist with a crunchy crust. I had to bake it a little longer than noted, but it turned out great! I served it with strawberries and no-weep whipped cream. AMAZING!"
571739,91644,2010-07-02,5,This is wonderful!  I made a half recipe in a loaf pan and it was delicious served with macerated strawberries and freshly whipped cream.  Wonderful texture and flavor!
397161,91644,2010-07-27,5,"WOW .......absolutely deliscious. I wish I could give the cake more stars. This is definetly my all time favorite pound cake recipe. I have looked for years for that ""special"" pound cake recipe and have FINIALLY found it. I didn't change a thing and was a bit cautious about making the cake without any leveling ingred. but in the end, the cake turned out so beautiful and actually had risen above { not over; thankfully } the pan itself. The only thing I might do different next time would be to add a pinch of salt or maybe even use 1 stick of salted butter {my preference}. Other than that I wouldn't or couldn't change a thing to make the cake any more tasteful. I served the cake with fresh picked Blackberries, Creme'Anglaise and Whipped Creme.....absolutely DIVINE.<br/>Thanks so much for posting. Saderbee"
147145,91644,2010-07-30,5,"Absolutely amazing cake! I made a half batch and baked it in a loaf pan. At the 60 min mark, I tented a piece of foil over the pan to prevent the crust from browning too much. Also added a pinch of salt and used the full tsp of vanilla for the half batch. I let the butter, cream cheese and eggs come to room temperature completely before starting. I froze most of the cake in slices, will update this review when I thaw it. Thanks, Jeff and Amanda!"
1500945,91644,2010-09-19,5,I was not a fan of pound cake until now.  This is amazing and the whole family loved it!  <br/>I added almond extract after a few suggested it. YUM!
697961,91644,2010-11-06,5,Love this cake! I added some almond extract as well. My family devoured it! Next time I'll try making it lemon by adding some lemon extract and lemon zest. This recipe is a definite keeper.
371738,91644,2010-11-30,5,Made this twice now.  Fantastic!!
318235,91644,2010-12-27,3,Despite all of the rave review this didn't do it for us. I was looking for something else...thank you though.
1319585,91644,2011-01-20,0,"I have made this twice now.  Excellent!  The second time I added a tsp of lemon extract and the zest of one lemon, then drizzled it with lemon juice and powdered sugar.  I have to say though that I thought the vanilla was better; I think my husband like the lemon version the best.  All my kids loved the vanilla one, even my son who won't eat cake."
1318331,91644,2011-02-16,5,"This was a huge hit at a potluck- several people asked me for the recipe. Moist, flavorful- delicious!"
140132,91644,2011-06-28,5,"So good.  I made this last night and we loved it.  I served it with some strawberries and whipped cream.  Thank only thing different is I added half almond extract and half vanilla.  Thank you for sharing, this is a great pound cake recipe."
1052873,91644,2011-09-18,5,"Excellent pound cake - moist, dense, and flavorful. I had to cook it 1 hr 40 minutes. After 1/2 hr cooling, I ran a knife around the edges but it still wouldn't come out. Let it sit upside down and eventually gravity did it. Note: use lots of Pam. I like the freezing slices idea another reviewer had, but I can't see it lasting long enough!"
1477540,91644,2011-11-27,0,"Easy, moist and good flavor. I did make some changes, 2 cups of sugar instead of 3, 2 sticks of butter instead of 3, added spinach puree (I can hear the yikes already!) and used white whole wheat flour. My 10 year old eats this for breakfast so I need to make a healthy version. Thank you for a great recipe!"
1702561,91644,2011-12-19,2,"Just made this a few days ago, and I must say I followed the recipe to the T. It is not the pound cake I had hoped for, it was very doughy in taste when eaten warm or cold. You can hardly taste the cream cheese at al, the six eggs kind of over power the flavor. It baked really well, it came out of the pan easily, and it looked pretty too. I just had a problem with the texture and the flavor. I guess my continue for the perfect pound cake continues. Thanks for sharing."
27643,91644,2012-01-19,5,"Wow!, This cake is wonderful! I followed the recipe, it's moist, rich, fantastic flavor, and it's  easy to make. It comes out of the oven beautiful. What more could a person want? Well, maybe for it to last longer. Thanks a bunch Jeff!! It's a keeper!!"
1833552,91644,2012-03-19,5,"I have been in this country for twenty years, and been looking for the right pound cake recipe for a long time, growing up in Africa baking was a part of my everyday life as a girl, my grandmother, my grandaunts, aunts all had one recipe for pound cake it was the family, and for the life of me when ever I tried to bake a pound cake using that recipe I can never remember. but this cake WOW! WOW ! just hit home, it is just right it reminds me of my grandma recipes it is so moist, the only thing I added was a level teaspoon of baking powder and some orange zest, mine, oh mine I just turn to a teenager again and travel home without leaving the shores of America, this is so good the way it bakes just right, I actually ate a half pan of this  cake right when it came out of the oven something I do not usually do. this was so  easy to make, thanks Jeff and Amanda."
275571,91644,2012-04-08,0,"I used this for Easter lamb cake. Came out perfect, thanks for sharing.<br/>Frosting easy not too many crumbs"
2172608,91644,2012-04-28,5,"This cake is fantastic! Very old fashioned, sticky and dense... just like a pound cake is supposed to be!  <br/>I reverted to my eight year old self and even licked the beaters ;)<br/>I cooked it in cast iron loaf pans and had no trouble with doughiness or underdoneness like other reviewers have suggested.  Just perfect!<br/>Ordinary pound cake will never be the same for me after this!"
32058,91644,2012-07-01,5,"Great recipe.  A friend of tours used to make this same pound cake and would not reveal the recipe....  ""Family Secret"".  Thank you for posting, now I'm in the know!  Am taking this to a new neigh bor tomorow.  I  made 2 loaf cakes instead 1 lg cake.  Cooked about 70 minutes.   Note to self:  added a teasoon or so of coconut, rum, butter, vanilla and almonf extract to the batter."
103876,91644,2012-08-05,5,"My daughter made this cake for our family vacation. She used a 9x13 pan and it turned out perfect. Great dense texture and rich buttery flavor. The ideal poundcake. I'm sure we'll make again. It's not healthy, but pretty much worth every darn calorie. Thanks for posting."
2455221,91644,2013-04-17,5,Amazingly great cake!  I doubled the vanilla and baked it for about 20 minutes longer since I live at a high altitude.  My husband loved it and it was even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.
363420,91644,2013-05-05,5,"My life is complete.  Wow, this is so yummy.  The crispy-ish crust that fell off is an extra little treat.  I added 10 minutes to cooking time, always have to add time with my oven. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update:  I still make this on occasion.  Right now I made a batch with 1/2 stick less butter, 1 less egg, and added 2 mashed bananas.  I&#039;m wanting strawberry shortcake, needed to use some bananas, and I couldn&#039;t picture myself putting those strawberries on anything besides this pound cake.  YUMMMMMM!"
2767545,91644,2013-06-06,0,Absolutely wonderful...moist and so delicious. I am so glad you shared this recipe! I served it with fresh strawberries and homemade whip topping! Fabulous!
2953649,91644,2013-08-26,5,??????!!!(greek for alsome)
1800127644,91644,2013-11-08,4,"this recipe is exactly like another here, southern living cream cheese pound cake, except for one change, that one calls for salt.....i made this today and it is WONDERFUL!  i did not add salt but did add 1 tsp baking powder and doubled the vanilla extract.....i also used 5 eggs, not six, since they were extra large.....i prepped my bundt well and cooked for 1:45-50.....it was even better after i glazed some of it, mixed 1 cup confect. sugar and 2 T lemon juice, mix until smooth and drizzle over cake......will harden beautifully and great lemon taste! the whole hive is happy :"
230102,91644,2014-01-14,5,"This was delicious!!  Taking the advice of a couple other reviewers, I used Crisco and flour and heavily coated my pan.  I also left it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, and probably could have left it another five or so.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  I would like to suggest that those that had issues used too much flour.  You must fluff the flour and then lightly spoon it into your measuring cup and lightly level off.  If you use the dipping method, you will end up with too much flour.  Also, in my experience, you cannot over beat the fats.  If your butter starts to separate, throw it out and start all over.  Pound cakes are tricky and I think these are the two main causes of failure.  This is extremely high fat.  If you worry about fat calories and grams, this would not be the recipe for you!  Please do not try to make it healthy.  Jeff, thank you for the recipe!"
1127743,91644,2014-03-03,5,"This turned out pretty amazing. It was my first time making a pound cake. I did let the butter, cream cheese, and eggs come to room temperature before I started making it. I also added another teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon rum extract. I cooked it in two 9 in cake pans and the cook time was around 1 hour and 20 min. The end result was delicious. I couldn&#039;t stop eating the top I cut off to make the cake flat. Would definitely make this cake again."
1834067,91644,2014-09-07,5,Excellent. I halved the recipe and used a loaf pan. I tented the loaf with tinfoil about an hour in to prevent burning on top. The total baking time was just over an hour and a half - I ended up baking it for an 1 hour 40 mins. I left one half as is and added fresh blackberries to the other half. Both were delicious. Very easy to make. Everyone loved it and thought it tasted better than other pound cakes they&#039;ve tried.
877529,91644,2014-09-19,5,"Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and wasn&#039;t sure how it would turn out since we live at a pretty high altitude here.  I guess the lack of leavening agents worked in my favor.  Hubby said it might have cooked a tiny bit more but it seemed fine to me.  Don&#039;t forget to grease and flour the bundt pan!  Also, I don&#039;t know if my pan is smaller than normal, but this makes a lot of batter and I needed to cook some in a loaf pan on the side."
1655293,91644,2015-02-15,5,Absolutely delicious.  I&#039;ll be making this one again &amp; again...
1610436,91644,2015-03-27,0,"I haven't made this ye, but it sounds so good. Wondering if it would work in a Lamb Mold for Easter. Thank you "
13075411,91644,2015-06-27,3,"It is not hard to make but the bake time is probably at least two hours!! I tried from 1 1/2 to  two hours and the middle of the cake still gooey, did not look it would set.The taste of the cake is great if you have a sweet tooth. Mine came out slightly dry because I left it in the oven for another 20 minutes with oven off after two hours baking. Not hard to make but check out your own baking time."
245017,91644,2015-07-29,5,"This was absolutely delicious!!! So good It&#039;s something I won&#039;t make often or I&#039;ll eat all of it. Everyone in my family loved it. Followed directions and a few tips as far as greasing and flouring my pan and folding the flower in by hand, not with a mixer."
1179225,91644,2016-01-11,5,Excellent! I don&#039;t even want to know how many calories or how much fat this cake contains. Who cares?! It&#039;s delish! I halved the recipe except for the vanilla and baked in a loaf pan tented with foil for the first hour and then uncovered for 40 mins. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
727055,91644,2016-04-02,5,"I have made this twice now, and my picky eaters are begging for more. If you are watching calories, using margarine and lite cream cheese works out fine, but REAL butter and REAL cream cheese REALLY makes you stick your face in the pan, like Jeff says. We didn&#039;t even put any icing on this, it was so good. (Although my pickiest eater put butter on his and ate it like a slice of bread.) I also baked this a bit longer than called for, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Thank you Amanda for letting your Dad share this with the world!"
2001022199,91644,2016-05-31,5,"I made this cake last night, it turned out perfect!! My fiance' said it was the best pound cake he had ever tasted. I used cake flour, my eggs, butter and cream cheese were all at room temp, this will definitely be my go to for a plain pound cake."
182330,91644,2016-09-04,5,"I've been making this for a few years, now. It's the ONLY recipe I'll use. The tang of the cream cheese adds a sort of &quot;umami&quot; to the flavor. The density of the cake is almost creamy in nature. I have made french toast from thin slices, as well. Always a hit! I find the recipe to be a little sweet... but we all still gobble it up! My husband made this cake with me yesterday, and I told him to dish up three cups of flour and sugar each, and put it into one bowl (mistakenly thinking wet ingredients / dry ingredient) and realized after the fact, that I was supposed to tell him to cream the sugar and butter, add one egg at a time, etc... didn't make a single difference. AMAZING CAKE!"
2000996491,91644,2016-10-31,5,Amazing! I was trying to use up some cream cheese and once I found this recipe I couldn't wait to try it! I actually cut everything in half exactly the way the recipe calls and baked it in a loaf pan. It turned out so great! I will be making this again and again! Thank you so much for a great cake :-)
2001481005,91644,2018-01-19,0,I give it a five star. Cooked it 10 minutes longer in my bundt pan. Bottom edge was ever so slightly crisp. I took a shower and when I came out it was half eaten. My family us fighting over it. No changes were needed a yummy cake and I'll be making it again. Very easy too
2002102882,91644,2018-04-08,5,"Made this following recipe exactly, however I used a 9 inch round springform cake tin. The baking smell drew out my teens who wanted to eat it immediately. Turned out beautifully with a slight cheese cake taste. Loved it, will be a regular bake in our house I think."
323186,522710,2015-08-04,5,"Very easy to prepare and delicious, my husband thought I had made a lot of rice, but worked his way though it in no time at all!!   Much enjoyed, thank you for sharing, made for Culinary Quest 2015 (Switzerland) for Lightbulbs On The Beach"
88099,432837,2011-10-15,5,So simple yet so good.  I will say that I did drain all but just a glaze of the bacon grease from the pan before toasting the bread and that worked great.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Fall PAC
266635,432837,2014-05-01,5,"Delish!  This is a very tasty bread.  I used pre-cooked bacon for this dish and that cut down considerably on bacon fat.  The bread toasted up nicely -- this went very well with our dinner.  Made for Spring PAC, May, 2014."
679960,262698,2008-02-05,4,"It definitely needs more sugar - I used about 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was ok.
I'd also recommend pre-cooking the cassava before grating just to stop it from being too dry."
305531,334452,2008-12-01,5,Yummers!!!!! This is so easy and so good! I made this exactly per the directions and everyone raved about this bread. Thanks diner for sharing another great recipe. Made for Photo Tag.
383853,334452,2009-01-13,5,"Yum-O!  So tasty.  It was the perfect side to my ravioli (premade, I was feeling lazy!)  I made exactly as posted and will be making again.  Thanks for sharing!"
212609,334452,2009-02-13,5,"I have to agree with everybody else and just say YUMMY!!
Made for 1-2-3 Hits."
386585,334452,2009-04-14,5,"Simple, easy, and delicious!  What more can you ask for?  I will be making this again.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
383346,334452,2009-05-03,5,"I didn't use French bread, I used brunch bread.  We really loved the flavor of the garlic butter on the bread.  So yummy!  Thansk Diner :)  Made for Gimme 5 tag game"
226863,334452,2009-06-26,5,"I just used regular bread, thick sliced, because I didn't have any french bread on hand.  But the garlic butter mixture was very good.  I used all the garlic, and followed diner's suggestion and used a lower amount of basil.  Thanks for posting!  Made for Zaar Stars Tag."

581409,334452,2009-10-07,5,superb!!! usually I just make up my own recipe for garlic bread but thought I would try this-so glad I did.very easy to put together.I used dried Italian seasoning instead of just basil.Otherwise followed recipe exactly.The result was a very professional looking garlic bread.Very yummy-my children loved it.Very nice with the crock pot lasagna.I will make this again and again!!!!!!Thankyou!!!!
296809,334452,2010-06-04,5,"I am so sorry that I forgot to review this recipe 2 wks ago when made for company. While this easy-fix & ingredient-friendly recipe was essentially made as written, I did alter the presentation slightly by using sml crusty French rolls so I could plate them as part of a starter course. I am glad I made extras & had them on the table because my guests devoured them w/an excess of greed. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
560491,334452,2010-06-09,5,"This is very flavorful bread and we all loved it!  The only thing I didn't like about it (personal preference) was that is was too wet even after it was toasted.  Next time I will just reduce the ingredients by half and make it that way.  Don't want to change the flavor, just less of the topping for us...Made for ZWT6 Greece."
178427,334452,2011-06-08,5,Wow! This is so good. I used slices of Recipe#155369 for this. It turned out fab! Thanks for sharing. Made for ZWT7-Italy.
1701315,334452,2011-06-10,5,Very good and easy!  I loved the tang that the lemon adds.  I used ciabatta rolls and added a sprinkling of pizza cheese before baking.
1179225,334452,2012-12-25,5,"Mmmm.... I love garlic bread, but rarely make it because I will eat it till it's all gone. I usually wing it, but thought I would try something new. I was intrigued by the lemon and it really does add a nice tang. For whatever reason, I couldn't taste the basil. I'm looking forward to trying this on the grill with artisan bread. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
314988,201622,2008-02-17,5,We really enjoyed this. It would be good on crakers but we just ate it right from the baking dish.  It was very colorful & we'll definatley make again.
452355,201622,2009-12-27,4,We enjoyed this baked brie dish.  It was really easy to prepare.  I doubled the ingredients to accommodate a 13.5 oz round brie.  We served with sliced baguette rounds and crackers.  Thanks!
226863,413252,2010-04-25,4,"This is really yummy, but my corn wasn't tender after 30 minutes on the grill.  Otherwise, this was delicious!!  Thanks for sharing!"
350938,413252,2010-06-28,5,"Very nice recipe. I used dried chili peppers as I had no fresh peppers on hand and it turned out perfectly. Will make again, thanks for sharing :)"
780172,413252,2010-07-12,5,"I love corn and it is fun to try different fixings and this one is a keeper. A little heat and a little tang, yum, yum."
542159,413252,2010-08-15,5,"Yum! The chilli lime butter really brings out the sweet flavor of the corn and they complement each other so well. Made as written, cooking for 20 minutes and cutting down to two servings. Thanks for the post."
424680,413252,2011-06-27,5,"Except for the fact that I bought one of the smallest red chilies I could find & then used just half of it, I did follow the recipe on down! Great way to grill corn, & a very tasty way to serve it! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
261676,66727,2006-12-17,5,"This is our family's favorite Christmas cookie!  The only thing we do differently is sprinkle flaked sweetened coconut (maybe 1/3 cup total) over the rounds after the preserves and walnuts.  Then we sprinkle the rolled crescents with granulated sugar before baking, rather than with the powdered sugar afterwards.  Thanks so much for posting, now I'll always have this recipe at hand!"
1267223,66727,2009-12-11,5,Very good.  These are fun to make and look so cute!!  Made for P-A-R-T-Y 2009.
394085,207861,2007-04-15,4,"Those deep south Junior League cookbooks are dangerous!  (I know...I have a bunch myself--Baton Rouge and Monroe, Louisiana, Charleston, South Carolina and half a dozen more).  
These boats are so rich there is no way I could eat two of them in one sitting.  They are luscious, easy, impressive. Did I say rich?! Perfect for a formal ""ladies luncheon""...perfect for an informal meal for one. I used lime juice and it was perfect.  Thanks, twissis."
1245373,333449,2009-04-20,0,My uncle used to make this for holidays.  It is soooo yummy.  I've looked for years for this recipe.
450004,76906,2008-07-05,4,"I just made this, and it was so yummy!  I don't like sweet drinks, so I didn't add any extra sugar, but my boys had extra in theirs. It's so cold here today, and this was a great way to warm up a little! :)"
56112,76906,2010-02-27,5,I made this using Gevalia Sleepy Time Tea....WOW a great bedtime tea for these cold rainy days.  I did use a little more of the mix than just a pinch because I wanted a little more flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe.
146552,392612,2010-02-21,4,I had a large chicken so I doubled everthing but the chcken and butter. This was a quick meal to put together adding garlic and will add onions and mushrooms the next time.  I salted the dish but would not do the again due to the onion soup being on the salty side.  Thank you for posting Catnip46 a recipe that I will fix again.
866963,392612,2011-04-11,5,This was soooo good and easy! I substituted some bacon renderings for the butter and since I was out of milk I used half and half. The only other change I made was to give it a sprinkle of pepper and paprika before putting it in the oven. The gravy was amazing served over some chive mashed potatoes. (2)
305531,392612,2011-08-05,4,"This was pretty good. I used a healthy version of cream of mushroom soup and that certainly made a difference in my mind on the consistency of the gravy. It was rather thin. Next time  I would use the standard version to thicken it up a bit. The taste was good, but the again, the gravy was a bit thin. Thatnks  for sharing. Made for 123 Hits Tag."
679953,392612,2012-01-16,5,"Made this as posted except I did use 2%milk, and low fat butter.  Other than made as posted, very flavorful and the kids, and myself enjoyed for lunch today.  Made for 1-2-3 hits.."
357358,114784,2007-01-14,4,"This was very good. I did tweak it slightly by reducing the butter to one cup and adding 1/4 cup chicken broth (not boullion). I used both white bread and sunflower seed bread which gave a bit more texture. It was a touch salty for our tastes so next time 1/2 teaspoon salt will suffice. I served this with Recipe #28518. Shredded the left over chicken and mixed it, along with the gravy, then added it to the leftover stuffing and that turned out to be a five star leftover! Thanks Twinkle."
160974,114784,2007-04-08,4,"I made this for Easter dinner. It is similar to my favorite recipe, except mine has more onion and celery. . I like it when they don't have chicken broth in them. Next time I will make it in the crock pot (since I like the way it melds together). Thanks for posting your family favorite, Twinkle.

193516,110871,2005-05-24,5,"I had this sandwich this morning, as I do occasionally when we have pancakes.  If you like Pb and banana sandwiches you will love this!!  I used Low Fat Buckwheat Pancakes (#65901) and about 2 tbsp natural peanut butter.  I also used a little more banana, and just drizzled the maple syrup in the sandwich, not outside, as the bananda I used was very ripe.  YUM!!  A great, different way to eat pancakes!!  "
345569,110871,2007-12-26,3,"I had half a banana to use up and wanted something a little different than the regular sandwich... this was an interesting twist!  I didn't actually use the peanut butter, just the bananas and syrup inside the ""sandwich.""  I wasn't too crazy about the taste of the bananas with the syrup, and ended up taking apart the ""sandwich"" and eating the elements separately.  It was an interesting idea, though... thanks for posting!!"
706608,110871,2008-07-07,5,One of my favorite trail lunches when camping! I use oatmeal cottage cheese pancakes and then roll each up tight in plastic wrap. Envy of everyone around!
29110,110871,2010-09-25,5,"We make ours with chocolate chip pancakes and peanut butter, we will have to try it with banana. They are quite sweet, so we forego the syrup.<br/><br/>My 4 y/o is a breakfast avoider, but pancake sandwiches usually get some food into him."
763736,161033,2008-05-15,4,"These didn't rise very much, so I can't say they were beautiful; but, on the pro side, they had a delightful taste.  I am interested in trying this recipe for banana bread sometime.  Thank you!"
163112,503317,2013-09-06,5,"I&#039;m a wee confuzzled because the title says coconut cream but the ingredients/directions say coconut milk.  I used coconut cream (is this different from cream of coconut?)  and omitted the added sugar.  Absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe for a quick afternoon snack.  Made for ZWT9 Family Picks, Mike &amp; the Appliance Killers."
26278,28215,2002-11-05,5,Loved this simple recipe.  The apples and raspberries together were excellent! Will try this one again.  Thanks for posting
172169,28215,2004-12-02,4,"Really good combo, though I'll probably go easy on the cinnamon the next time around. You bet there will be a next time! Thanks."
229052,28215,2006-09-11,5,We had this for dessert tonight.  I used 3/4 Cups of Splenda in place of the sugar and low fat margarine in place of the butter and served this with low fat vanilla ice cream.  Will definetly make again.  Thanks Miss Annie.
107651,28215,2009-09-24,4,"Apples and raspberries, two of my favourite things!!  I had to use up some Gravenstein apples and some frozen raspberries, sadly I did not have a cup and DD said next time you will have to add more raspberries!!! It is a delicious dessert, I used brown sugar, flour and butter for the topping..and the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon was perfect for our tastes."
633361,500133,2013-09-01,5,"Very easy to make, and a fantastic and different way to cook broccoli.&lt;br/&gt;We loved it here served with our roast.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Miss Fannie."
537937,301964,2008-09-01,5,"The best part of this casserole is how quickly it went together. At the last minute I decided to put together a quick brunch for DH and DS. Followed your recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing.  (well I did add a sprinkling of cheese the last 5 minutes of baking).  The meat part could be very versatile with the use of sausage or cut up ham chunks. Thanks for posting this keeper! Made for Sept.'s ""Breakfast Anytime"" Photogame~"
1020526,301964,2008-11-17,5,"I also made this recipe recently from A Taste of Home (2002 or 2003, can't recall).  It was a recipe created by a male chef.  I thought I would miss the eggs, but I didn't!  I really loved this!"
237951,301964,2008-12-09,5,Delicious and easy---my favorite combo!  We'll definitely have this often.
317696,301964,2010-01-18,4,"This made a really good side for my Sunday brunch.  My only complaint is that it did not brown as I would have liked it to.  However, it tasted wonderful."
199848,6622,2009-03-18,5,"Creamy, colorful and crunchy.  The flavor is great with that little hint of sweetness from the apples!   I used 3 small golden delicious apples.  I had no celery salt, so I used celery seeds + salt.  This is a fabulous coleslaw; thanx!"
450004,344420,2009-02-15,3,"This was tasty, but I felt it was lacking in something..not sure what.  I was makining this to take to work this morning, so I had no time to paly around with it.  Also, I think it was maybe a bit runny, but that was my fault for adding too much cream I think.  I think the best measurement for this, would be 2 TB of cream and 2 TB salsa, for each avocado.  I served it witha  French Stck, which I had sliced thinly and toasted in the oven."
1097211,344420,2009-04-28,0,"Sour cream in guacamole?  I grew up on Tex-Mex and we just use avocados, lime (or lemon) juice, chopped tomatoes, and chopped onion.  You can easily add heat with Tabasco or jalapenos.  Also, cilantro (if it floats your boat)."
282948,144921,2006-01-17,3,I think there may be a problem with this recipe.  I tried it as written (with 1-1/2 Tablespoons of ground mustard) and it was so bitter I could hardly stand to taste it!  I tried again with 1-1/2 teaspoons of ground mustard instead.  It still has a slightly bitter flavor but it actually complimented the asparagus quite nicely.  Together it was tasty but I took a couple of stars off for confusion.
59570,43281,2003-05-06,5,"Quick, easy and my kids love this fruity drink! Thanks!"
354465,43281,2007-03-27,5,"So quick and easy! Uses all the things I alway's have on hand. Had to share it with my daughter. She said ""Mmmm, Ice cream is good mama!"" :) Yes it was, Thank's Dawn!!"
422893,43281,2007-04-22,5,"This was great, a nice blend of flavours that both me & my 19 month old daughter enjoyed & will be making again! Thanks!"
1542746,381328,2010-02-04,5,This is probably the most amazing casserole I've ever had!! There were no leftovers whatsoever! And everyone was asking for a copy of the recipe. No one could believe how EASY it was! Thanks for posting!
199848,381328,2011-03-09,4,"I LOVE Vidalia onions so I had to make this.  The onions got sweet and tender.  I used a mix of mozzarella cheese and some swiss cheese as well.  Loved all the cheese!  It was very good, but I really could have done without the crushed potato chips.  I also would add some herbs or spices next time.  Very good and I will make this again with the changes mentioned.  Thanx!"
593927,180996,2011-02-12,5,"This is good! I used unrefined extra virgin olive oil, organic apple cider vinegar, allspice as a substitute for nutmeg as we do not consume intoxicants, sea salt, and the rest. Made for Veggie Swap 31 ~ February 2011."
220348,180996,2011-02-15,5,Really sweet dressing. It goes wel with arugala and herbs.
464080,180996,2011-04-11,5,"YUMMO.  I used this atop a simple carrot, apple and raisin salad (I threw in some pepitas for good measure) and it was PERFECT.  I did add a little maple syrup in with the dressing as I wanted it to have a touch of sweetness, but wanted to continue with the Autumn Theme of the dressing.  Excellent, easy dressing.  Thanks for posting!"
573325,180996,2012-01-19,5,"This makes for a super yummy dressing! The cinnamon, garlic and apple cider vinegar go so well with the olive oil and other spices. Mmmm! I used this to dress your recipe #191018 and it was a lovely addition!<br/>I did reduce the amount of oil and vinegar used as I only needed a smaller quantity, but kept the spices the same. It was very nice that way!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this recipe here with us, CG!<br/>Made and reviewed for our VIP Queen during Veggie Swap #33 April 2011.<br/><br/>January 2012: I just have to comment again on this delightful simple yet very special dressing: I LOVE it! :) This time I made half the recipe reducing the oil a tad but other than that stuck to the recipe and enjoyed it as always. The spices are perfect and it worked so well with my feta-corn-tomato-lettuce salad. Yum!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH once again for sharing this delicious dressing with us, CG!"
329769,264806,2008-05-02,4,*Reviewed for PAC Spring 08* Quick and easy to put together. I baked mine in the oven. I wasn't sure if I should seal the foil into a package or just leave it covered- I sealed the package and then uncovered for the last few minutes of baking. Potatoes and onion were cooked beautifully in the oven. I think this would be great for BBQ too. I'm thinking would be fantastic with some sliced kumera and fresh herbs added . A very nice vege side and a great side for anyone who doesn't enjoy salad at a BBQ gathering. I'll post a photo later too :) :) :) :)
133174,264806,2008-05-04,4,This made a very quick to fix side for the grill.  The potatoes were russets.  I did add several cloves of sliced garlic.  They were cooked on the grill in heavy duty foil.  Made for *PAC Spring 2008*
702607,264806,2009-06-27,5,These were great and really easy to make. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  Very good!
11176,60481,2006-09-19,5,"Oh, georgi... how could you have kept these from me for so long? You know, I don't even like sweet stuff, but all I wanted to do after the first bite of my piece was get MORE...before I even had a second bite!  Perfect. Even my picky husband said so. Not too sweet, lovely texture and excellent mixture of flavors. And EASY!  I did cut the recipe in half as I only had two mini spring form cake pans (and zero ""loaf"" pans), but next time, and that won't be much longer than a day or two, I'll have the proper number of pans (30) and will be One Happy Piggy!  Thanks so much for a great recipe, my little PAC munchkin! ;o)"
59780,60481,2007-01-22,5,Yum! I made this recipe after seeing it suggested in community cafe but I made it in muffin tins. I also subbed blueberry pie filling because I had some to use up which made the batter darker than it would have been with just blueberries. The kids loved this and I'll use this recipe again! Thanks for posting!
240789,60481,2009-03-01,0,"This is a really great recipe!  I only had 2/3 cup of blueberries left, so I added an equal amount of dried cranberries, and it came out super great! I used the lemon yogurt you suggested, too.  Thought I'd be freezing a loaf or two, but we couldn't stop eating them until they were gone!  So moist and delicious! Nice job, georgi, a keeper for sure!"
120976,60481,2009-07-31,4,This was good. Very similar to the recipe I always use with the exception of the yogurt. I needed to cook it longer than recommended. The last 10 minutes I covered it with foil to keep it from browning any further.
226066,60481,2009-08-04,4,Moist and quite tasty!! Love the little loaves - they were too cute to eat... almost!! ;) Used a little less sugar and added a bit more blueberries.  Baked for about 40 minutes. Thanks georgi! :)
526411,512595,2014-02-09,5,"This was mine and my husband&#039;s first green smoothie.  Neither one of us tasted the spinach when we drank them.  I used frozen blueberries, frozen raspberries, and fresh bananas.  It was great.  Next time, I will make it with strawberries instead of raspberries due to the seeds.  Thanks so much for this  post.  Now I know I can drink green smoothies!  I made this for &quot;New Kids on The Block&quot; tag game."
266635,512595,2014-02-15,5,"Great smoothie.  The only change I made was to use 2% organic milk vs. the almond milk.  Used fresh blueberries, strawberries and of course bananas.  What a nice way to start out the morning.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag, February, 2014."
1933172,60481,2011-06-16,0,Great recipe.  Blueberries seem to compliment the banana flavor.
163986,302815,2008-05-09,5,"I will rate this without making it because I have been making this for years.  Both my granddaughters love it.  Every time my youngest granddaughter is here for lunch, she asks for it.  I use garlic salt or garlic powder in place of the fresh garlic because it is easier when doing lunch but the fresh garlic is out of this world.  This dish has wonderful flavor and it is soooo easy."
361931,302815,2008-07-23,5,"Very good -- very easy!!  Used rotini pasta, and extra garlic and cheese (just because I love garlic and cheese!).  DS had already eaten his dinner, but kept begging me for bites of mine -- I have taught him well!!  Three years old and a garlic/pasta/cheese lover :)  THANKS!!!"
212609,302815,2008-12-05,5,"This is a good example of the fact that you don't need alot of fancy ingredients and hours slaving over a hot stove to produce something that is satisfying and flavoursome.
Delicious!!"
369715,302815,2008-12-26,4,"This was a good, easy side dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written. We all enjoyed this."
169430,302815,2009-01-15,5,"I used lemon pepper pasta for this and it was a simple and simply delicious way to do pasta (even if your not in a hurry). The slice of ham and carrots were the supporting players for the pasta. I used a tsp of a ""healthier fat"" margarine for 1 serving and let the parm and garlic shine. Made for Gimme 5 game."
537937,302815,2009-02-23,5,"MMmmmmm this went together for me in no time.  I love side dishes like this that are easy with few ingredients but yet get high remarks from the fam.  This is a real keeper Lainey!~
Made for ZaarStars."
923645,302815,2009-03-25,4,"It was good...but I felt that it was a bit bland. Therefore, I added red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and a bit of cheddar cheese...yummm!"
954556,302815,2010-11-30,5,"I make this all the time and enjoy it every time!  I love using fresh shredded Parmesan cheese, and not the stuff in the green can.  It does make a difference in the taste."
1443660,302815,2012-12-27,4,"Very good and simple....you can spice it up a little and make it more of a meal by adding oregano, parsely, fresh ground pepper, and garlic salt to the butter and fresh garlic. Add cooked pasta to spiced melted butter stir to coat in skillet and then add ground cooked italian sausage, and cook until hot.  I also add 1 beated raw egg and stir in to past mixture and cook for an addidional minute.   Add parmesian cheese after pasta is on the plate.   Great for Lent by adding mushrooms instead of the italian sausage."
2000112027,302815,2015-04-03,5,"This recipe is super simple and SO yummy. My boyfriend and I had a nice, candlelit dinner and he LOVED IT. I&#039;m a horrible cook, but I definitely nailed this one. SUPER YUMMY."
37779,302815,2015-05-25,5,"So easy and exactly what I was looking for to satisfy my pasta craving. No changes, perfect as written. Thanks."
600146,98800,2010-07-19,5,"Excellent over fresh greens.  Just a basic, easy homemade dressing.  Thanks!"
163112,439608,2012-04-24,5,"Brilliant!  I used 2 bunches of asparagus.  I messed up & only had 1 orange so I used the zest of a lemon, orange segments from 1 orange & the juice of both.  It was delicious!  Made for Aussie Swap 4/12.  resubmitting because omg i missed assigning stars!"
104472,180875,2006-09-18,5,"Very nice side dish.My kids, who normally shy away from raisins, ate it and did not complain.The almonds give it a nice crunch.great recipe for fall."
39394,180875,2007-04-10,4,"Lovely, lovely deep rich brown appearance!  We enjoyed the slightly sweet flavor as well.  I felt that it needed less butter (a first for me).  Would make it again, the put it in the oven and forget it aspect was great, but definately would decrease amount of butter to 2 tablespoons.  Thanks for the recipe."
1530111,180875,2010-02-04,5,"Used the crockpot at work instead of the oven.  Cooked it on low for awhile, then high, stirred it a couple of times and added some water toward the end.  Did the prep at home. It took about three hours, was ready for lunch for the office crowd.  Just as easy and good.  Subbed water for broth and olive oil for butter. Used less than 4 Tbs of oil, too.  The rice I used was very short grain brown rice and it was called ""sweet"" brown rice.  There were no instructions in English on the bag!  I mistakenly dumped in the almonds before cooking and it was still a hit.  While it cooked, delicious smells invaded the office, everyone was ready to try it by the time it was finished."
229619,180875,2013-04-27,4,Served this with citrus pork chops for dinner tonight and it was yummy.  I cut the butter to 2 tbs and used golden raisins.  Loved the addition of the toasted almonds.
59064,63388,2004-02-09,5,"Great pesto. I have a bit of a basil glut at present and DH is a bit sick of basil. However although he groaned and protested wildly when he saw the basil sitting on the bench waiting to go into the blender, there were no complaints when I served it up with a ricotta gnocchi recipe from Zaar.
My toddler loved this too and ate all her dinner with absolutely no protests :-D.
Very easy to make."
115621,63388,2004-02-09,4,"It's a good pesto still seems high on the calories. I sent in a pesto with similar ingredients except I split the cheese into romano/parmesan blend it cuts the calories to 155 fat to 139 see recipe # 81307 frozen pesto. I like pesto, this was good."
704950,63388,2009-05-11,5,"Wonderful and easy to make!  I needed a quick, fresh pesto to put onto recipe#301464 and this worked out perfectly!!  Thanks for the recipe!!"
35526,85201,2004-03-27,5,My best frined and I spent the day together cooking and laughing.  This is one of the recipes wshe chose to make for us.  We halved the recipe and it still worked very well.  Tasted great and will be a part of the buffet for our next party.  I covered the cookie sheet with foil for easy clean up.  Thanks for posted such a great little dish.
101823,85201,2004-04-05,4,"What a great appettizer! These were so easy, too! The creaminess of the cheeses and the smokiness of the bacon really complimented the heat of the jalapenos. These are definately a keeper at my house. One note, though, it is a good idea to wear gloves while seeding the peppers...the oils of the peppers will make your fingers burn.
"
37036,85201,2004-06-08,5,"Fantastic!!!  I made only 1/3 of the recipe for DH and I to snack on while waiting for dinner and all I can say is that I should have made more.  I tried only ONE and turned around to find that DH had eaten all of them by himself!  I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe, they were perfect! Thanks Cher! "
65955,85201,2004-07-02,5,"These were so simple and a great way to use up our bumper crop of jalapenos. I seeded the peppers under running water, which really kept my eyes & throat from burning. I too lined my cookies sheets with foil, and I also stuck the peppers in the freezer for about 20 minutes, which seemed to help keep the cheese mixture from running as they cooked. The flavor combo is great, and we will definitely make them again. Thanks, Cher!!"
51224,85201,2004-07-02,5,I'm always looking for good appetizer recipes.  These were very tasty.  I used a vegetable cream cheese and Hormel real bacon bits to simplify one step.  Everyone loved them; thanks for posting!
88099,85201,2004-07-03,5,I first made these a couple of weeks ago and they were absolutely wonderful.  The second time I made them I didn't boil the peppers because we like them a little crispy.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe.
106212,85201,2004-07-11,5,"I only made half a batch for a small get together.  Boy was I sorry!!  They were gone in about 5 minutes.  These are absolutely delicious.  Boiling them for 5 minutes, made them very soft, so I may only boil for 2-3 minutes for a little more crunch.  I love the fact that there is both cream cheese & cheddar cheese, instead of 1 or the other."
126440,85201,2004-07-12,5,Made these last weekend for an appetizer.  They are great.  Very quick and easy.  Try these!!!
4439,85201,2004-07-12,5,"I made these for a family reunion, not my side of the family. there were a few brave souls who tried these and loved them. the cheese and cream cheese neutralized some of the burn and I thought they were superb"
31499,85201,2004-07-15,5,"I was cooking a Mexican themed menu, and at the last minute I decided I need an appetizer to go with the blender full of margaritas I was mixing up.  Since I was cooking in someone else's kitchen, and not familiar with the local grocery, I also wanted something very simple. This recipe fit the bill perfectly.  I cut this by about 1/3 as there were only two of us, but otherwise followed it exactly.  Very easy to make, and tastes just great. "
41503,85201,2004-08-02,5,Yummmm! These are the BEST Cher! I don't miss the greasy fried/coated ones at all. The only change I made was adding chopped green onions to the cheese mixture. Thanks for sharing this gem ;-)
129078,85201,2004-08-23,5,"These were very good!  I used my fingers to press the filling in and cheated by using a jar of Hormel bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon.  I did, however grease the pan with Pam and they were definatly soggy due to this.  I won't make that mistake next time - which will be soon!  Thanks Cher!"
66549,85201,2004-08-26,5,Wonderful. They went very quickly. One of my friends who is pregnant made herself sick eating way too many. We will keep this as an appetizer favorite for sure.
48623,85201,2004-11-26,5,For Thanksgiving I made half recipe for a bunch of displaced Texans.  Rave reviews.  Have been asked to make full batch for Christmas.  Thanks!  
37636,85201,2004-12-12,5,"These were great! They don't really comapre to breaded poppers but then they are a different kind of thing (and definitely lower in fat and carbs!). I used double the amount of bacon on mine, and instead of cheddar used a Mexican cheese blend. My only disappointment was that my jalapenos were not as spicy as the ones I grow in the summertime, but that can't be helped, as the ones at the market are very mild (at least to me). Thanks for posting!"
28636,85201,2004-12-23,4,"My DH made these recently and really enjoyed them!  The flavor was great, but the peppers were a little tough.  We'll blanch them a few extra minutes next time.  A great snack for those cutting back on carbs!   "
411567,85201,2008-05-22,5,"WOW, these are great!  I missed the part about boiling them first, and when I was eating them, I was wishing they were a little softer. Lol, I think the boiling first will accomplish that ; )  Or maybe roast them in the oven for a few minutes.  I used fat free cream cheese.   The cheese holds the bacon on quite nicely too : ) excellent recipe! Thanks!"
160947,85201,2005-03-12,4,"Confession..I've made this at least 10 times and am finally getting around to a thank you.  It's really a super good recipe! I started off blanching the jalapenos the full 5 minutes and have been slowing working down to about 1 minute. I prefer the slight crispyness and ""bite"" with the shorter boiling time.  I often increase the recipe by half again so they'll be leftovers for a midnight snack or lunch the next day..they reheat very nicely in the microwave.  Thank you for a wonderful pepper treat without deepfrying. I'll be making these forever!!"
68884,85201,2005-03-28,5,Yum. I served these as an appetizer for Enchiladas Suisas #33990 & Mark H's wholly guacamole. I halved the recipe but should've made a whole one :) Blanching the peppers - that never would've occurred to me w/o your recipe. I added a little garlic powder & a dash of crushed red pepper to the cheese mixture. These were easy & great - thanks
32724,85201,2005-03-30,4,"These were good.  We actually had them tonight as a side dish.  Shelly made half the recipe, but they are pretty rich so we will be having some for snacks.
I think the boiling of the peppers knocked out all of the heat unless our jalapenos weren't hot to begin with.  I think we will experiment with less boiling time.  These would make a fantastic appetizer."
56919,85201,2005-03-30,4,"These are rich and tasty little suckers.  I've never seen a stuffed jalapeno recipe where they are boiled before baking so I was intrigued.  I was afraid they would turn out too limp but they held up just fine.  I reduced the recipe by half and used regular cheddar and reduced fat cream cheese.  These are surprisingly mild so anyone who doesn't like spicy stuff there is no need to fear these -- in fact I wish they had had a bit more heat to them.  These are a healthier alternative to many stuffed peppers as they aren't breaded (which is good for low carbers like me) and aren't deep fried.  Easy, rich and delicious.  Thanks Cher! "
13817,85201,2005-04-26,5,"My wife was uncertain when I told her what I had found as an appetizer for the potluck we hosted this past weekend.  She loved it, so did our guests, and I'm supposed to make it again next weekend (along with a whole list of other stuff) for my daughter's college graduation reception.  Last time I cut the recipe in half; this time I'll make at least a full recipe.  Thanks for a great appetizer."
118950,85201,2005-05-15,5,"Took these to a Cinco de Mayo party...such a beautiful presentation and they were the  first to go!  I had boiled the peppers and made the filling ahead of time, so stuffing them and baking just before the party was a cinch.  Being a new ""southwesterner"" I am going to dazzle many visitors with these peppers!  Thanks."
56680,85201,2005-05-23,5,"These came out wonderful, I made a half batch because it seemed like a lot, but they all dissappeared and fast!  Thanks for keeper, I will call them mine!"
71460,85201,2005-06-09,4,A great appetizer.  Goes especially well with a couple of cold beers!
50762,85201,2005-07-04,0,I used these for my 4th of July party and they were the hit of the party. They were very good. I didn't change a thing.....
93006,85201,2005-07-06,5,"Terrific, and relatively easy - the toughest part is seeding all those peppers!  Ours had quite a kick to them - I read recently that the pointier peppers are hotter; rounder tips are milder.  A very tasty appetizer - great with anything from the grill, and one that everyone thinks you've slaved over!"
55380,85201,2005-08-06,5,"This was my first attempt at cooking stuffed jalapenos, but I figured since I live in TX I should learn how. :) I made half a batch and seeded the peppers under cold running water. Even with reduced fat cream cheese, the cheese mixture was thick enough that I could just press it in with my fingers; I made them up about an hour ahead of time in a very lightly sprayed 9x13 and then popped them in the oven as people arrived. They were a big hit. There were a few left over that I reheated the next day for another get-together; they disappeared in no time. Thanks for an easy, colorful, and popular appetizer recipe!"
95743,85201,2005-10-27,5,Add me to the list of satisfied snackers. These were rich and wonderful even without the bacon. And sooo easy.
107334,85201,2005-10-30,5,Another 5 stars.  Made these for our Halloween Party last night and they were among the first to go. I was able to make them up well in advance.  I did the boiling the night before and in the morning mixed up the filling and stuffed the peppers.  I held them in the fridge for close to 6 hours and then baked with no problem.  I did mix the bacon in with the cheese mixture.
24928,85201,2005-11-04,5,"Very good!I made these ahead of time, I used the bottled bacon bits and put that on before I put them in the oven. I took them on one of our camping trips, we have a travel trailer so we have an oven, they were a big hit and I will definitly bring them again, it really helps to be able to prepare them ahead of time at home. "
198945,85201,2005-12-12,5,These were the hit of our party this weekend I doctord it up with a little seasoned  salt - doubled the W. sauce and  added 1 tsp. of habenero sauce  to kick it up a notch
64780,85201,2005-12-18,5,"I made these for a Christmas potluck, and they were a big hit. I also increased the Worcestershire sauce and added a couple of dashes of granulated garlic.  As another reviewer suggested, use gloves when cutting and seeding or your hands will burn from the oils in the peppers. "
7802,85201,2006-02-08,5,"I made these for Super Bowl snacks and they were certainly a hit. Very easy to make and a great use of three of the major food groups: peppers, cheese and bacon. Thanks for posting this Cher."
470799,85201,2008-07-08,5,Wonderful & easy! Made it for 4th of July & they were gobbled up! Will definitely make again!
988077,85201,2008-10-13,5,"Very good! Next time I would change a couple little things. I would add a little garlic and onion powder and pepper to the cheese, do more bacon, and boil them less, bake them at a higher temp to make the jalapenos a little crispy. Other than those few changes they were great!"
340369,85201,2006-08-30,5,"Great recipe! My co-workers, however, wanted more zing to it. So I added few things. I added:

onion, chopped(1/2 cup)
green onion, chopped(1/4 cup)
garlic, minced(8 cloves)
crushed red pepper(2 tbsp) 
cilantro, chopped(1/4 cup)
black olives, chopped(12)
salt(1 tsp or to taste)
and I topped with sourcream. 

if this sound too comlicated, i would just add salt to bring out the flavor of the cheese.
Also, we tried boiling pepper in 1,2,3,4,and 5 minutes. It worked best with 1 minute. After 2 minutes , pepper was too soggy."
56002,85201,2006-09-01,5,"Made these today and they were great. I followed other reviewer's
suggestion and only blanched for 2 minutes- still had a little crunch and a little heat. Also I incorprated the bacon bits right inot the cheese mixture. Something fun to do with all the jalapenos in the garden;-). Thanks Cher."
146047,85201,2006-09-03,4,"I really enjoyed these peppers. They'd be a nice addition to a football party spread. Very easy to make, especially with help from my food processor. I did feel like the filling needs a bit of salt and a little something extra that I quite identify. Maybe a bit of garlic or onion?! Thanks for posting this!"
290994,85201,2006-09-27,5,YUM! I made these last week and they were fabulous! They are a great delicious GLUTEN FREE appetizer. Just make sure to use gluten free worcestershire sauce. Thanks for sharing Cher!
246936,85201,2006-09-28,5,Super easy to make and very yummy. Will make agaun and again. Thanks so much for the recipe! 
197244,85201,2007-01-13,5,"Absolutely loved these - we used Jalapenos the first time and almost had to evacuate when boiling them without a lid, none of us could breathe, so be sure to use a lid when boiling.  The second time we used green bell peppers and they tasted pretty much the same without the hotness while boiling and I tend to have green peppers around more than jalapenos.  I think we will probably be making these quite a bit - thanks for posting!!!"
390058,85201,2007-02-04,2,"Just not what I was expecting.  The filling was OK, but didn't care for the peppers.  Think I'll stick with the fried versions of this appetizer."
87109,85201,2007-02-14,5,Our guests and DH went absolutely wild for these-we will have again and again-thanks for an easy treat
250238,85201,2007-02-18,4,I lacked bacon bits so I just wrapped them in whole pieces of bacon and baked them.  The filling was EXCELLENT.  I did drain them and pat them dry to remove some of the fat but other than that....delicious!
35140,85201,2007-03-02,5,"I also wrapped mine in thin strips of bacon instead of sprinkling the bacon.  I served them with ranch dipping sauce.  My husband took one bite and said ""these are insane"".  They are honestly the best stuffed jalapenos I've ever put in my mouth.  I mixed a packet of ranch dressing mix with two cups of sour cream and a little extra garlic powder for dipping.  Heavenly."
46104,85201,2007-03-11,5,"I took these to a poker party and they were a hit. I was lazy and used bacon bits instead of bacon, but they were still awesome."
396030,85201,2007-05-23,5,These were absolutely delicious!  I made them for my new husband and he loved them.  We were so pleased.  I started craving them the minute we had eaten them all.  Thanks so much!
507592,85201,2007-05-28,4,"This was a really good appetizer, but they are hotter than the store bought (boxed & frozen) variety. My guests were amazed at how good they were and couldn't believe that I had slaved over these tasty little bites.... I never told them how easy they actually were to make. I doubled the bacon for my version."
430663,85201,2007-07-09,5,My wife and I finished a whole tray of these before anyone else could have any :)  Very nice appetizer!
375111,85201,2007-07-14,5,"These were a big hit at our house too! They are so simple and quick, but super tasty! Don't be afraid of the peppers, they are not spicy at all! Everyone that had them thought they were great! Great recipe Cher!"
15077,85201,2007-07-22,5,I love the fact that they are not fried.   I love the fact that they are low carb.
511861,85201,2007-08-06,5,Yummy!
187373,85201,2007-08-26,4,"Yum! Was worried it might be a bit spicy since I have friends who don't like a lot of spice, but they were perfect. (Even though I accidentally forgot the bacon!) Thanks for a great recipe!"
49879,85201,2007-09-26,5,I have made these twice and have been a big hit both times. Did not change a thing.
382203,85201,2007-10-13,4,I served these at a party and the men all raved about them. Thanks
85528,85201,2007-11-27,5,"These were outstanding and really easy to make.  I didn't boil them either.  I baked them at 350 for about 30 min instead.
I took this appetizer to a potluck and they were gone in a hurry."
437974,85201,2007-11-28,5,These are definitely addicting! We used jalapenos from our garden. They were a little smaller but still very good! Be careful when seeding jalapenos; wear kitchen gloves or your fingers will burn for days!! :) I did not boil the peppers. I just cleaned and filled them; then baked @ 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
293671,85201,2008-01-12,5,"These are the most wonderful peppers!  I used fat free cream cheese and stirred Oscar Mayer bacon bits into the filling.  My kids love them which is suprising because they normally won't eat peppers!  The hubby loves them and he absolutely HATES cream cheese.  I had to beg him to try one and now he is in love!  Thank you so much for the wonderful, simple, healthy recipe!!!"
649868,85201,2008-10-29,5,"These were sooooo good and so easy! I made them for a tailgate and renamed them ""ROCKY TOPper POPPERS"" - mixed the cheeses and boiled/sliced peppers the night before. Put the two together & baked n the morning, then wrapped in foil and heated up later in the day on a propane stove (grill would work too)! I will definitely be repeating this recipe soon!"
298070,85201,2008-12-22,5,"Had a list of new recipes to try for Holidays 2008. This was the hands down winner! Didn't have gloves to clean peppers,put my hands in sandwich baggies! It worked well! These were easy and delicious!"
480970,85201,2009-01-15,5,"I made these last night and they turned out great.  My husband loved them and to my surprise my daughter, who curled her nose and said ""I don't want any of that"", went back for a second one after i placed the first on her plate for dinner!  I cut the recipe down to 3 jalapenos and added green onions and salt to the mix.  I also put them in the freezer for around a half hour.  Next time I will blanch them a little longer (I only left them for 2 minutes).  These were delish.  Oh!  and I used Oscar Meyer bacon bits in place of the bacon to make this a ""quick meal"" side.Thanks for the great recipe!"
743849,85201,2009-02-18,5,"I'll be the 63rd reviewer for this recipe - and I can't wait to rave about it!  I didn't have enough cream cheese for the ratio provided, so mine were more cheddery (which is fine with me!).  The boiling the peppers in the water really helped keep the heat factor to managable for both hubby and I.  I started with 4 jalapenos (only 2 of us eating), but we each ate 4 halves and wished we had more!  The bacon adds a nice saltiness and crunch.  I sprinkled some green onions on mine (see photo, if you'd like).  Just delicious!  I would highly recommend to anyone!"
140132,85201,2009-03-03,4,We really enjoy poppers so I wanted to try my hand at them at home.  This is a very easy recipe to follow and they tasted very good.  Thank you for posting.
653438,85201,2009-06-28,5,These were fabulous.  I did cut the recipe down for just the two of us...will be making it again.  The peppers were very mild so next time I think I will boil them less or not at all.  This is in my collection to make again and again.  Thank you!
546985,85201,2009-08-01,5,"These are fantastic!  I have made them many times now, and have just noticed that I never reviewed them.  The first time, I boiled them too long - 5 minutes really is the perfect amount of time to boil them.  The bacon is a perfect flavor with the jalapenos.  Turkey bacon also works well with this recipe.  Thank you Just Cher, for a wonderful recipe!"
373018,85201,2009-08-24,5,These are so good  I've made them 2 days in a row.  Super yummy and easy.  Made as directed (mostly).  Added a little garlic powder and  I didn't add bacon..didn't miss it either.
260911,85201,2009-08-29,5,"I used banana peppers out of my garden - very tasty!  Not as much heat as jalapenos, of course, but still good."
470351,85201,2010-01-02,5,Wonderful!  Made for new years eve and used fat free cream cheese and 2% fat shredded mexican blend cheese.  I omitted the bacon  and increased the worcestershire slightly.  We LOVED it!  They were the hit of my party and were gone in a flash!  Will definitely make again!
220234,85201,2010-01-15,5,Oh man were these GOOD! I took these to work for a carry in and several people wanted the recipe and they were the first to go amongst all the food we had! Awesome recipe!
1235658,85201,2010-05-08,5,"I made these for Cinco De Mayo and OMG were they good!  The flavor was fantastic and these are a cinch to make.  I had never had Jalapeno Peppers like this before, but I will definitely be making these again."
1661670,85201,2011-06-02,4,Delicious! I like them with bacon wrapped around instead of just crumbled on top!
222564,85201,2012-04-19,5,Yum! I liked the method of poaching them in boiling water first.
839492,85201,2012-08-15,4,"I had just the right amount of peppers but wasn't having a party so I prepared as instructed (except I steamed mine in a steamer basket over boiling water) and baked what we planned to eat this evening as instructed. The others I made as instructed (by all means to speed up the process, I recommend using a food processor & a cookie dough scoop) and laid out on a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper and froze for a few hours, placed in a freezer zip top bag for another day or party. Thanks for sharing we enjoyed them even though our peppers were hot, hot, hot. Make sure you wear gloves! Thanks for sharing."
453440,85201,2017-09-24,5,"With so many great reviews the only things that might help others are what I have discovered making these &quot;Great Stuffed Jalapeno Peppers&quot; many many times. DH, family, friends and I love stuffed jalapenos. While I have many good recipes for the grill, I can make these year round. (good weather and bad). This recipe is great for my bumper crop each Summer. I stuff them and freeze them. I thaw and bake them when I want. Always perfect. I never boil or steam the peppers. Before stuffing, I just microwave the pepper halves for 4 min. (You might only need 3 min. in a newer model). - I usually have cooked sliced bacon in my freezer. There are times I put some bacon in my Cuisinart and pulse a few times then add it to the cheese mix. In the Summer I might dice some of my garden chives and add it to the mix. My peppers always look like the pictures posted and taste awesome no matter what I do. Thank you JustCher. Sorry I didn't post a review sooner. :( PS: We had some last night and I have another batch in the freezer."
296809,170971,2006-06-19,5,"I needed something crisp & light to go w/an otherwise “sturdy” Mexican dinner last nite & your salad was perfect. Since I favour Mex fare so much, I’m a fan of avocado … but I’d never combined it w/cottage cheese. What a nice surprise it was to see how well this combo works. Maybe pers pref, but I found I needed to add a fair amt of salt. This salad works well as part of a main meal & will also make such a quick, easy & tasty lunch for me. Thx for posting."
225021,170971,2006-07-15,4,"The combination of lettuce, avocado and cottage cheese works well and I agree with twissis that it makes a nice side dish to a Tex-Mex or Mexican meal. I served this as part of a meal with grilled corn and steak with chipotle butter. BF (who actually prepared the salad) doubled the dressing as he found the stated amount too dry with all the ingredients. He peppered the avocado first and I think maybe I would sprinkle the cream cheese with a little bit paprika before mixing it into the other ingredients another time. This would add taste and colour. I had some fresh coriander in the fridge (the Asia shop sells them in huge bunches) which I roughly chopped and added four or five tablespoon to the salad. The combo of lettuce, avocado and cottage cheese is nice, but as those ingredients are all rather bland the mixture can be improved by adding spices and herbs. Thank you for posting this salad, Katia."
199848,170971,2007-05-14,5,"Very light and refreshing for lunch.  It's creamy and crunchy and a little tangy, too!  Also great because it can be whipped up in just minutes.  I think some chopped scallions would be fabulous in this salad.  I'll try that sometime.  Thanx for posting."
149363,170971,2008-03-02,5,"This is an easy and delicous salad. We had it for lunch with some fresh bread and butter and it was perfect. I love avocado, so this one will be made again. Thanks for the terrific recipe!"
703869,306862,2009-04-10,5,"All I can is wonderful!!! I loved it. i did add lots of pepper, but I love pepper!! Thanks for posting"
463202,305393,2008-06-10,4,"For what it is, this is lovely.  Do not think it is going to be anything like a modern cake.  There is no leavening, so this ends up being a very dense ""cake"".  It is more akin to a homemade energy bar, and was very tasty!  We liked this best drizzled with more honey.  I will definitely be keeping a copy of this on hand just in case we have a school project come up! :)  Thank you for posting, made for ZWT4."
424680,305393,2008-06-12,5,"What an interesting recipe to make, & when all was served up, I called them Ancient Greek Chews, which I served with individual sides of citrus honey! VERY TASTY, VERY UNIQUE, VERY ENJOYABLE! Thanks for sharing! [Made & reviewed while in Greece during Zaar's World Tour 4]"
166642,305393,2008-06-16,4,This is very unique but very good! It wasn't difficult at all to make and a great treat. Made for ZWT4 for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers.
382071,305393,2008-06-19,0,"Sorry, this one didn't work out for me. I followed it exactly, using wildflower honey and sesame seeds ground with my mortar and pestle. I'm wondering if I should have used Tahini? Mine was burned and dry at 30 minutes and had an odd flavor. Made for the ZWT4."
621626,305393,2009-10-05,4,I thought this was a little bland. I did add some cinnamon to the mix before baking. I think it will taste better with honey drizzled on top. Made for Photo Tag
465056,257521,2007-10-18,4,I spritzed the bagels slices with water then shook them in a bag with the spices.  It took longer to cook (about 7 minutes)
240552,257521,2007-11-13,5,"Yummy!  I used 6 mini whole wheat bagels and upped everything to 4 T. canola oil, 1 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp cumin, and 1/2 tsp paprika. I then sprinkled with seasoning salt.  I was eating them as they came out of the oven without trying to burn my tongue. LOL!  These were great! Thanks for the recipe, Redsie!"
69838,55255,2003-03-30,5,"This is so nice and creamy! Such a nice, refreshing dessert/snack.  We had a filling dinner tonight.. baked cod fillets, garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli smothered in melted cheese... so this dessert was really nice to end a filling meal.  I just want to stress that you need to make sure you dont add too much vanilla.  I found that I had to add a little sugar to the recipe because it was a little bitter without it.  This is a marvelous recipe! THANK YOU SO MUCH!..and thanks for helping me figure out the measurements :-) I look forward to trying many of your recipes!!"
87693,55255,2003-11-02,5,This turned out just like soft serve ice cream (minus all the fat of course). Thank you so much for this wonderful idea. I love bananas and I love ice cream and this is a perfect way to have both!
113429,55255,2003-11-21,5,"This is just too weird!  Who knew a frozen banana could have a soft-serve consistency!  I added a splash of almond extract and some Splenda, and it's just wonderful.  My kids gobbled it up.  Thanks for a great recipe."
104295,55255,2004-01-11,5,"I too added a little splenda to offset the ""bite"" that frozen bannana sometimes has.  The kids fought me for it!  Very nice flavor, my 4 year old was calling it ""bannana ice cream"".  Definitely like soft serve.  Thanks for a great way to beat my ice cream craving in a healthy way!"
101275,55255,2004-03-11,5,"Wwwwwonnnnnnnnndderrrrrrrrrfulllllll! Such a treat Geema. Thanks a million! Made this as you said just added a little honey for taste. The the consistency was amazing! A five star recipe all the way. I have this picture in my head of banana 'ice-cream' coming out of my ears!!!! That's how often I am going to make this!!!
:) Fay"
55380,55255,2004-07-03,5,"We do this a lot; it's always a hit with the kids! Sometimes I freeze blueberries, strawberries, etc on a cookie sheet and keep them in a bag to toss in with the banana to blend up fruit 'ice cream' smoothies, too. Low fat, low budget, high ratings! :o)"
174685,55255,2005-06-09,5,"OMG!! THIS WAS AMAZING!!! i was so hesitant to make it at first because it was so simple. my friends were over, and they were totally postive it would just be a big mess, but everyone loved it and went for seconds. and at first glance you didn't even say how many bananas or how much juice, so i reallyw asn't sure about the recipe. i used 2 medium sized banans with black freckles ( chunked and frozen, ) maybe about 2 spoons of orang juice, a  tiny drop or 2 of apple juice. and i was about to use milk but my friends wouldn't let me, hehe.. i also added just a little spoonful of vanilla. and also maybe about a spoon or two of sugar, depending how sweet you like it. this texture is awesome and it is so incrediby healthy. i'll definitly be making this again maybe even  ssome with berries"
140028,55255,2005-06-10,5,I've done this many times with frozen bananas...I make it more into a smoothie. I also usually add some sugar or honey because it really brings out the banana taste. 
222696,55255,2005-08-17,4,"This was quite tasty; however, it didn't meet my expectations after reading such glowing reviews. Nevertheless, it was creamy and is a great, healthful alternative to real ice cream. It did satisfy my craving for a sweet treat. I used soy milk, a little Splenda, and a small amount of vanilla extract with really good results. Thanks for the idea!"
46545,55255,2005-08-29,5,"My favorite way to make ""ice cream!""  I just use a bit of water and cocoa powder to make mine chocolate. Haven't tried it with vanilla yet.  Great way to satisfy one of those chocolate cravings!"
304222,55255,2006-10-13,5,"Oh my goodness I can't believe how good this simple recipe turned out!!!!!! This tasted like SOFT-SERVE ICE CREAM!! I used a little soy milk, a little orange juice, skipped the vanilla, and blended it in my hand chopper. I scraped out some seriously awesome stuff!! I think the soy milk contributed a lot to the creaminess. "
338232,55255,2006-10-18,4,"This was a good, healthy, eventing snack.  Frozen banana has long been one of my favorite snacks, but now I have another great way to have it!  I'm going to have to try adding some other berries next time."
176124,55255,2007-02-11,5,"This is fabulous, healthy and oh-so-easy! The vanilla essence is a must as it lends the final product an icecream-like flavour, and tones down the banana. I used soy milk but I think regular milk would probably give an even better icecream imitation. I usually have a stash of bananas in the freezer (whole or halved) so I just slice them when I take them out of the freezer and throw them straight in the food processor. Delicious banana icecream, in less than 5 minutes, and best of all, without the guilt! Thanks Geema."
419636,55255,2007-03-03,5,"This was just a great recipe to make! It is so simple and so quick, and yet so delicious! I made this recipe but without adding any liquid to it and it tasted just wonderful! I have made this over and over again and just keep a few batches of this in the freezer. Thank you so much for a clever way to make ice cream!!"
210184,55255,2007-04-07,5,"Awesome stuff! I blended in some sliced strawberries, crushed pineapple, and a little milk. Then, I topped it all off with some fat-free chocolate syrup and fat-free Cool Whip. Tasted just like a banana split...only fat free! Delicious!!"
319847,55255,2007-05-16,4,Mm! very tasty! i think maybe the bananas i was using were a little *too* ripe when i froze them because they gave the ice cream a bit of a strance taste. can't wait to try including some other fruits in there! thanks!
482812,55255,2007-05-17,5,This is a great summer dessert! I've been making it a couple of times a week since getting this recipe.  I use soy milk to make it a little more creamy.  Its also good with cinnamon instead of vanilla.
329638,55255,2007-05-31,5,"This was great! I had a bunch of bananas in the freezer and the kids were clamoring for ice cream, so I treated us to banana splits!  Made the 'ice cream', the spooned a bit of the low-sugar strawberry jam I put up last week on top, a small dollop of fat free cool whip and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.  Didn't miss the regular ice cream at all!  Thanks so much- this is sure to be a regular in our house this summer!"
49542,55255,2007-05-31,5,"I've gotta say, ""This is really good!""  I used about 3 frozen bananas, 2 T of milk and 1 t vanilla.  It turned out great.  You almost believe you're being bad when really you're being good.  I usually have frozen bananas available but I might just have to buy them to freeze when they get really ripe, just so I can make this treat.  Thanks for a recipe to satisfy that sweet craving without going overboard!"
394604,55255,2007-06-12,5,"I cannot believe that I forgot to rate this recipe!  I just cut up and put a couple of ripe bananas in the freezer to make it again.  It is soooo good!  Close enough to ice cream for me.  I use my little electric chopper and off we go.  It is a yummy alternative to the real thing, and not nearly as guilty a pleasure!  Thanks for this one, who would've thunk it?"
202463,55255,2007-07-06,5,We made this when my toddler was sick with the juice and no vanilla.  He loved it.  He calls it his sick tummy treat.  The recipe is easy and tastes good.  It's also good with honey.
556453,55255,2007-08-11,5,"This treat is really delicious!  I used my Magic Bullet to whiz up 2 small perfectly ripe bananas, 2T vanilla rice milk, and 1/2t vanilla extract.  Mmmm..."
462336,55255,2007-08-13,5,"excellent, it's like a super healthy frozen yoghurt! loved it 5*"
522122,55255,2007-08-15,3,This tasted like banana milk puree. It is easy to make if you have bananas that are already frozen. I made the puree at room temperature and then tried to freeze it. It looked like it does in the picture and needed to be much colder.
225896,55255,2008-01-19,5,This was a real treat. Satisfied my sugar craving and completely guilt free! I used vanilla rice milk to blend mine.
83093,55255,2008-04-08,5,The best treat I have had in weeks! I was very surprised at how creamy it got! I added a packet of Splenda to 1 frozen but not so ripe banana and only needed a splash of vanilla and nonfat milk to get an excellent consistency. Cannot wait to try this with other fruits added; mango sounds especially great.  Thanks for posting this!
345969,55255,2008-05-08,5,"This was AMAZING! I made it for a dinner with my girlfriends and they couldn't stop gushing about how fabulous it was. The ""ice cream"" was very rich and creamy and tasted like a sinful dessert. I used 6-7 frozen bananas and probably about 2 cups of milk (I didn't measure the milk, just kept adding it until it reached the right consistency), and it came close to filling my 11-cup food processor.  Will be making this often!"
60486,55255,2008-06-28,5,"Have made this a few times. Instead of adding milk or juice I've been adding liquors, ie: coffee, maple.  Makes a great cooling snack!"
474155,55255,2008-08-02,5,"This recipe is a revelation. Yes, the frozen bananas actually are the creamy consistency of ice cream. I used sugar free vanilla syrup as the liquid -- bad idea! It gave it a weird aftertaste. But, I think this would be amazing with a little cream and 1 tablespoon of sugar per banana. I would also like to try adding a tiny bit of cocoa powder.."
171923,55255,2008-08-20,0,"OMG!!  This was fantastic.  What a revelation!  I will never look at a banana the same way again.
We put chocolate chips in before we puree.  And sometimes a bit of ground coffee.
One tip - don't freeze whole bananas like I did.  Peel and chop up, then freeze.  I found that the more frozen the desert was, the more ice  creamy it was, so eat it right away before it turns back to mushy bananas cinderella-styley.
Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  We'll be making this to death!"
711534,55255,2008-09-03,4,"I made this last night with heavy cream b/c I didn't have any milk. I didn't believe everyone saying that it's like soft serve ice cream, but it really is!!! (^O^)/
I think I will read some of the suggestions that others have written and try them now on my 2nd batch. Chocolate sounds good."
102672,55255,2008-09-10,4,"I thought the flavor was really good - not like ice cream, though it did have the same texture.  My 2-year-old was not fooled however and refused to eat it.  But I did not mind at all having to eat it myself :)"
760429,55255,2008-12-01,5,"Oh my god this was abosolutely incredible. My dad is super picky about desserts (he likes burnt sugar cookies better than any other cookie) and he loved this. I could not believe the texture- I usually use bananas in smoothies, but this was so thick and creamy, not at all runny. I added a squirt of low sugar honey because I was out of Splenda and it was marvelous. I used 6 medium sized bananas and about 1/4 or 1/3 cup of milk. It made 3 or 4 cups. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!!!!"
975947,55255,2009-01-11,5,"AMAZING!!! My husband says, ""for being healthy, it is pretty good!""
We did everything as directed except I used Vanilla almond milk in place of the milk. (:
Will make this at least once a week for a snack! (:"
855476,55255,2009-01-21,5,Yum! i didn't know so few ingredients would make this. :) It was very good! I used milk but I think next time I will use juice or something to add some extra sweetness. Thanks for the great idea!
1205101,55255,2009-03-24,5,"This is sooo good!
I used some blueberry jam insted of the vanilla extract, and it was perfect. Didn't need no sweetener :D
Thank you!"
512309,55255,2009-07-11,5,"This was fantastic.  I used 4 small-ish bananas, about 1/2 cup milk, a tsp or so of vanilla extract, and about 2 Tbsp honey.  Yum, yum.  We got four generous servings.  Thanks for this easy recipe!"
294000,55255,2009-09-11,5,"This saved the day when we opened the fridge and our strawberry ice cream was ""chewy"" (yuck).  My 4-year-old was more than happy with this ... and her mom and dad enjoyed it, too!  Even baby sister got to try!  We did add a little sugar and honey.  Wonderful!"
303877,55255,2009-10-24,5,"This is perfect for me and my husband, we cannot have sugary desserts, but this let us have 'ice cream'. For adults, using a few spoonfuls of kalua, o frangelico liquor makes it extra good. Thanks for this recipe!"
1072593,55255,2010-01-01,5,The healthiest food I ate this entire holiday week.  Made for Alphabet Soup Tag.
1489402,55255,2010-01-04,5,"this looks so yummy but i could not figure out how many bananas to use or how much fruit juice. :(
if anyone could help me that would be great. thanx :)"
537617,55255,2010-01-16,5,"This recipe is amazing!  My family loves it!  We used frozen bananas, a few frozen strawberries, some fat free half and half, vanilla and some splenda.  YUM!  
We can't wait to try other flavors also!  Thanks for this ""magic"" recipe!"
108555,55255,2010-03-16,1,"We hated this!  It tastes just like frozen baby food puree.  I don't know what I was expecting since the ingredients are just bananas, milk, and vanilla, but I was really hoping for something somewhat reminiscent of ice cream, and this was not even close.  I threw out most of the batch."
1212393,55255,2010-03-18,5,"Love this, and so does the boyfriend (who is not into health food). You shouldn't think of it as ice cream though. ""Frozen dessert"" might be better. I love this with a little granola or a dollop of peanut butter. A few tips from my trial and error: cut the banana into relatively small chunks. I just quartered the bananas the first time, and it was a little difficult to get creamy. Food processors work a LOT better than blenders - don't know why. Loved it! Thanks!"
620763,55255,2010-06-03,5,This is a great low fat dessert. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I used 2 bananas and about 4 TB of skim milk to get it to the right consistency. Next time I will try it with a touch of vanilla.
528468,55255,2012-07-10,5,yum
116137,55255,2012-10-09,5,"Oh wow. This was way better than I expected.  My bananas always seem to start browning before I can eat them so I throw them in the freezer whole (peel and everything). I pulled some out, peeled and chopped them up and whirled them with almond milk,cocoa powder and a touch of vanilla.   Delish!  This will now be a go to recipe when we are craving something sweet.  Thanks for a great recipe."
1926335,55255,2012-10-10,5,We have been making this for years however we really would rather have chocolate milk or add chocolate syrup.  I have told a lot of friends about this - we call it a chocolate shake.
1179225,55255,2013-04-20,4,"Really good! Love that I can enjoy this creamy delicious treat and not feel bad about it. I used juice, but think I would prefer milk next time. I&#039;ve made something similar but using PB and honey and that works great too. Looking forward to experimenting with this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!"
1803684521,55255,2016-02-07,5,"Wow! This was so sweet and delicious, it was hard to believe there was no added sugar! I used unsweetened almond milk and vanilla and it turned out fabulous. Thank you!"
58931,55255,2016-10-20,5,"LOVE this! I make it in the VitaMix and it gets super creamy fast. I like it as-is, but it's also a great canvas for other flavors you might like to add in."
2001610310,55255,2017-07-08,5,Amazing. This treat was needed! I am a gluten free vegetarian who also gave up ice cream and french fries. I was hitting a wall and this right here gave me a second wind.
416380,195304,2008-01-27,5,"Served these little appetizers at my daughter's baby shower and they got rave reviews. The recipe is so easy to make. I did use a heaping tablespoon of Gorgonzola, black pepper instead of white and only needed one can of asparagus.  There were enough asparagus in the can to make a whole loaf of bread (20 slices).  I froze them ahead of time and just popped them in the oven at the shower!  Wonderful flavor and thanks so much for the recipe!"
6357,82433,2004-01-31,4,This was yummy! It made a nice breakfast for me this morning(not to mention a real quick one too!!). The only addition I made was to sprinkle some freshly ground cinnamon in step 3. I loved this with a hot cup of Nescafe coffee. Thank you for a great start to my morning!
124222,82433,2004-02-28,5,"This is great for anytime. However, I like to toast my bread first. I also like to mix peanut butter and honey together first and then add the mashed bananas.This is so easy even my children can do it. Yummy!"
157102,82433,2006-12-01,3,"Rather bland...too much honey overpowers any banana flavor. Maybe adding a pinch of salt and using only a teaspoon of honey would improve it. Nice contrast of flavors, though. I might try experimenting with this some more."
2001985253,525818,2018-02-11,3,"I liked the cookies, but i added a little bit of flour, and they were not as good as another recipe I tried"
56003,295815,2008-04-22,5,"Lee, if I could, this would be a 10 star recipe.  I've had strawberries in balsamic & sugar before, but this goes beyond the pale!!  Just the right amount of sweetness versus the natural tang of the fruit.  I really didn't know if the strawberries were better or the pears.  The only difference between yours and mine, is that I left mine out on the counter so the flavors would be even more intensified.  So, in consequence, mine is a lot darker than yours.  I would have loved to post a picture, but wouldn't you know it, tonight I took some really lousy pics.  I can't say enough good things about this salad, so keep coming up with these wonderful recipes.  Wanted to but couldn't, because some one got there first, adopt for Spring 2008 PAC."
860079,295815,2009-01-19,5,"Chef Lee, this was an unusual salad for me...I really liked the sweet/tangy combination, but it sure made me pucker :) The 1st time I've had balsamic with fruit, but I liked it the more I ate of it. Will definitely put this on in the keeper cookbook, though I may experiment with it using apples. Thanks for the recipe, made for Potluck Tag, Jan 2009."
337963,121233,2008-04-24,4,"Loved it!  Wow Courtly, for being so good for you, this smoothie was really good!  I used non-fat yogurt.  Please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most :)"
280271,514820,2014-04-08,5,This is so yummy...I doubled the recipe for two...but mine ended up in the freezer for about 4 hours...we had unexpected company...so when I took them out of the freezer I zapped them in the microwave for 45 sec...I can see making banana pops with the ingredients...what a nice summer cool down treat...I made sure the banana&#039;s were totally covered...I didn&#039;t want them to turn dark...thanks for posting it...made for Spring 2014 PAC
280271,342683,2011-10-15,5,This is so yummy! I cut the recipe down to two servings...worked great. We loved the flavor and it came out of the oven perfect. This is easy to prepare and depending on your sausage your flavors will vary..I used a basic breakfast sausage...we did top it with some hot sauce because we love the heat. Thanks for posting.  :)
37640,69990,2003-10-28,4,"I used pre-cut chicken fajita strips, and made a half recipe.  These were fairly tasty and I liked the fact that I didn't have much of the butter and spices left over.  If the DH goes back on his low carb diet, I'll make a point of making them.  He said they reminded him of shake and bake (which he likes).  I might not have gotten the full benefit of the taste because my spices are a bit old."
94740,69990,2003-12-09,5,"Very tasty, and easy to make.  DH doesn't ask for repeat recipes very often, but made a point of asking me to make this again."
35526,69990,2003-12-12,4,"This was okay.  I like that I did not waste a bunch of coating either.  Great for low carb dieters.  The only problem I had was that they stuck to the foil.  I will fix that next time, lol."
680747,69990,2008-06-27,5,"This was really good, I will make this again. The only thing i changed was that I used smoked paprika, and it was really good. Thanks for the recipe..."
805939,69990,2008-08-07,4,Excellent and easy but I thought the butter was excessive.  I'll try what another review suggested with using water to get the stuff to stick to the chicken and foil to keep it from sticking to the pan.
383802,69990,2008-08-17,5,"Very good.  Just a few tweaks:  Added garlic powder, didn't use the parsley.  I would reduce the salt by at least half next time just because it was incredibly salty with all the parmesan and butter.  HOWEVER, even salty, there wasn't a single piece left.  Very nice alternative to breading."
273527,69990,2008-11-01,3,The chicken came out very tender but the oregano killed it. It was on the salty side even after cutting in half.
134875,69990,2005-01-04,5,"Hiya Nane, I thought twice about posting my review because I did make some changes, just to suit my family's abnormal addiction to super spicy food!  We have NO taste buds left - that is JUST how spicy we like our food.  I halved the recipe (was cooking for three tonight, a total blessing - rather than the usual 6-7). No problem, no waste of ingredients - which was a pleasant surprise.  I used HOT Hungarian paprika, as well as some ground cayenne pepper, fresh parsley (didn't have the dried), added a little dried basil to the mix.  I also used Lawry's Seasoned Salt in lieu of regular salt.  I also added a dash of garlic powder.  The chicken came out great, I had pre-sliced chicken tenders and served over a bed of angel hair pasta tossed with a garlic/olive oil mix.  I took heed of one reviewer who said the chicken stuck to the foil, so I sprayed a super light coating of ""Pam"" on the foil before baking...still stuck, but not that bad, certainly didn't effect the taste whatsoever.  It was a little greasy, but that may have been my fault in not shaking off enough of the butter, however, this was easily solved by placing the chicken on paper towels to blot dry.  This is a keeper and I will add it to my recipe book, I thank you for sharing!  This would be great at room temp served over a lovely green salad.  I think the best part is the ease of preparation and the versatility...you can add whatever spices suit your fancy.  Again, a keeper, and another 5 star review from The Crabz!  Happy New Year!"
97901,69990,2006-01-12,5,"Good stuff. Super easy to make. I didn't coat them in butter first, I just rinsed them with water and coated them. I sprayed my foil really well with Pam and mine didn't stick at all. I think the paprika makes the dish."
68023,69990,2006-01-29,4,"Pretty good but I did make some adjustments because I didn't have the right stuff on hand.  I sub. 2 tbsp. parsley with italian seasoning and the oregano with garlic powder.  Unlike the other reviews, I had a lot of the mixture leftover.  It was a bit too salty for my taste.  Next time I'd cut the salt and add something spicy to the mixture.  Thanks, Nane, for the easy recipe!"
52578,69990,2006-02-04,5,Delicious.  I too sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  It worked like a charm.
119290,69990,2006-02-22,5,"I made these tonight.  I had 6 tenders, so I made 4 of them exactly like the recipe and for the last two, I added ground cayenne pepper to the dry ingrediants.  My 3 year old gobbled hers up (she had some without the cayenne).  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks! "
278620,69990,2006-02-22,5,"I made these tonight.  I added cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the dry mix.  I added hot sauce to the butter.  I have two teens, they both loved them."
157080,69990,2006-08-19,5,Absolutely wonderful!  My picky boyfriend who won't eat anything but pizza loved it.  A definite keeper. Thank you very much.
259150,69990,2006-09-28,5,Nane...these were sooooo good!  I will not say that I am an addict because then I would have to enter a program and I wouldn't be able to eat these wonderful little tenders again.  I followed the recipe exactly and I would not change a thing.  Thank you for this GREAT recipe.
156190,69990,2006-10-23,5,"Whenever we have cravings for a certain dinner, it is almost always for these.  They are easy to make and have the best taste of any chicken tender."
47540,69990,2006-10-24,5,"Tried this one over the weekend. Teens and husband alike approved whole-heartedly. Teens are into low carbs, too."
53932,69990,2006-10-28,4,"I thought these were pretty good, but a little salty.  I used shredded parmesan rather than grated and would not do that again. Thanks for sharing."
373008,69990,2006-10-31,5,"These were very easy and seem guaranteed to get compliments, well played."
270123,69990,2007-01-29,5,"Wonderful recipe!  I'm on a quest to eat healthier myself, and if I can trick the family at the same time, it's perfect!  I omitted the salt, and used 1/2 cup shredded percorino-romano and 1/2 cup shredded parmesan-romano instead of the grated parmesan.  Delicious, and will definitely be made often!"
126104,69990,2007-03-19,4,"These were very good.  I made them twice, and burned them to a crisp the first time, and they were still good (just hard as a brick).

They were easy, delicious and a weekly treat for me."
400991,69990,2007-05-14,3,"I liked the flavor of these, but I will not use the butter next time. I will just dip them in water.  The butter ran all over the cookie sheet and they werent as crisp as I would like.  The seasoning is great though and I will try it again."
618101,69990,2007-10-31,4,"This is a tasty meal my husband and I love it. There is a couple of things  
1. There was too much ingredient left over. 
2.  1 teaspoon of salt is too much, I only use Â½ teaspoon.
3. I did not use the butter, since I am trying to cut down on butter, so instead I use water, I just wet the chicken and then dip it in the seasoning.
I do say that I will be making this recipe again. And I recommended."
530432,69990,2007-11-12,5,My husband LOVED this recipe!  Said I could make it once a week and he'd be happy.
587756,69990,2007-11-21,4,"I only had a pound of tenders so I halved the recipe. It was very tasty for sure, I like how the flavor of the tenders is different and not the same old same old. My tenders cooked in only 15 mins which I was surprised about. I will be making this again."
576767,69990,2007-12-03,4,"These were very good.  I think next time I'd add a little less parmesan cheese, but thats to match our tastes.  I've never made tenders this way, I will be making these often!  Thank you for the recipe."
686591,69990,2007-12-13,3,"These were ok.  But I mainly blame my out-dated spice rack, the oregano I used really ruined it, and I didn't have any parsley.  My grandpa enjoyed them though."
482376,69990,2008-01-08,3,"These were good. However, we  thought the spice combination overpowered the chicken a bit.  I do like the ease of the recipe and it definitely fits into the low-carb lifestyle. Thanks!"
983634,69990,2009-01-13,5,"Very good. I omitted the salt per other review, and added garlic powder and a bit of chili powder. Mine didn't get crispy (not sure if they are supposed to) but that may be because I just used water instead of butter. The tenders turned out very  ""tender"" and delicious. I'm serving with spaghetti with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, fresh tomatoes and spinach."
1136770,69990,2009-01-19,0,"I made these tonite for dinner and they ignited my taste buds!  My husband actually commented on how good they were and the kids loved them! The only thing i did different was cook them on the George Foreman grill. This way, they werent greasy at all and they cooked superfast! I served them on a bed of angel hair pasta. Thanks so much for the delicious recipe. We will definetly have these again!"
640503,69990,2009-02-07,5,Yummy - made as is - family loved this chicken - very tender.  Its a keeper!
1112060,69990,2009-02-21,2,"I really wanted to like this based on all the other great reviews, but I just didn't. Maybe my spices were to blame? Anyway, thanks for sharing!"
769890,69990,2009-04-30,5,This was a hit for our family!  FYI keep in mind if you use salted butter to not use regular salt it...the parm has salt in it to so this could lead to overkill as it did ours the first time.  Also I've tried it without the various dried and simply used and Italian seasoning and that turned out well too!  Thanks!
951737,69990,2009-09-20,5,"Easy prep and easy clean up, what more could you ask for!
I lined my baking sheet with foil and sprayed that with Pam and had not sticking issues.  I made this with a combo of bonesless skinless chicken breast and thighs, marinated in a chicken tenderizer for 5-10 minutes and bypassed the butter.  Will try leftovers dipped in Ranch dressing for the appetizers while watching the NASCAR race today.
Thanks Nane!"
214991,69990,2009-12-12,5,"And we are addicted. A great, simple but delicious recipe. Thanks for sharing."
798621,69990,2009-12-27,4,"Great recipe! Instead of paprika, I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, omitting the salt. Will do this easy one again."
366781,69990,2010-01-24,5,I have made these for some time only I use chicken wings.  Make the same way and then you bake them for 1 hour.  Make sure you line the pan with foil as it is a mess if you don't.  These are very good.
332820,69990,2010-01-27,5,Fantastic! Simple & quick with plenty of flavor. Can't wait to try some of the other variations mentioned on spices! Thank You!
742928,69990,2010-02-23,5,"Wow! Hubby showed me recipe, we were trying to find new things to do with tenders. Recipe looked good, but, doubted it was worthy of the name. LOL I was so wrong! This was amazing. I kept going back and picking at the remainder pieces that were for my lunch. Kids loved it too, and super easy. You could change up spices easily, but, I loved it just like it was. This is a keeper!"
53002,69990,2010-03-02,5,"Not that this recipe needed another review, but I did want to pass on that I made this just as directed and ran out of the cheese mixture. So I made more but had to use fresh grated Romano cheese....My whole family thought that was better than the ""fresh grated"" prepackaged Parmesan cheese. 
Thanks for posting, we is a keeper recipe.
Rachel Castle"
188119,69990,2010-03-22,5,Great recipe! I added some ground up cheddar crackers and chili flakes to add a little kick. I dipped them in olive oil instead of butter too. Thanks!
1595619,69990,2011-02-07,4,I made these for my little girl's birthday dinner. I thought they were a bit salty but still tasted good. Thanks for the recipe!
1835026,69990,2011-02-24,0,"Very Very good and makes me love my LC diet :) <br/>Ate it over a caesar salad with caesar dressing.<br/>Everybody loved it and went back for more, even my picky non LC husband! <br/>I did run out of the cheese so I made more with an Italian mix blend of cheeses and that was sooooo good too! Will make this again. Thanks!"
2066636,69990,2011-11-16,4,"Quick and easy recipe! Simple to mix the ingredients, then 25 minutes in the oven - awesome! Plus the kids loved it; I'm saving this one :)"
240552,69990,2012-04-09,5,"These were superb!  I ate it on my salad as kayte1ps did.  Hubby loved it, too!"
187373,69990,2013-02-13,4,"These were okay, but not great.  I guess I prefer a breaded crust, but good to try."
213139,69990,2013-03-03,3,"These were pretty good, but we felt they were a little too salty, which is easy to fix.  The leftovers were great on salad the next day."
325147,69990,2015-06-04,0,"Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 cup parmesan and 1/2 bread crumbs, it was great."
396078,69990,2013-04-06,4,"These chicken tenders were delicious.  They are jam-packed with bold flavor, tender and juicy!  My 4-year-old daughter devoured her serving and asked for seconds.  :)  My only complaint is the coating did not turn out as crispy and crunchy as I had hoped.  Perhaps baking at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time would have helped?  Even with that being said, the chicken was still very tasty.  When cleaning up the baking pan after dinner, I was tempted to scrape up all the buttery, cheesy bits and munch away.  Thank goodness for willpower!  I&#039;m looking forward to left-overs tomorrow over a bed a fresh baby spinach and creamy dressing.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
2883165,69990,2013-07-01,5,"I would consider this the perfect recipe.  Prep time says 20 min but actually it takes no more than 10 minutes max to put butter in the microwave, mix the spices, and dunk the chicken.  And the result tastes perfect (I followed the instructions exactly).  Tonight I just wanted the meat, but if serving these as a meal I would probably serve with a salad, a steamed vegetable and a plain roll.  There&#039;s enough butter on the chicken that a plain roll without butter would be a great companion.  I cannot BELIEVE how quick and easy it was to make something this tasty."
215215,69990,2013-08-19,5,"Yup, easily become addicted to this wonderful recipe."
231507,69990,2013-10-23,4,"This was super easy and other reviewers are correct, very moist and good. What surprised me most was when I reheated them the next day for lunch, they were almost better than when they were first made, still extremely moist. DH said they were just ok, thus the 4 stars."
149415,69990,2013-11-08,3,The taste was ok- but the chicken was just soaked in grease. Is the 1/2 cup butter really needed or could it work to spray with cooking spray and then roll? Thank being said- the chicken did taste good. I think I&#039;ll experiment with either less butter to reduce the grease.
581019,69990,2013-11-24,5,Forgot to rate
583967,69990,2014-01-10,5,"Holy crap! I was a bit thrown off by the name, but the sure as heck live up to it. These things are amazing. I added some crushed red pepper flakes and it made them &quot;pop&quot;. Served them with brown rice and seasoned black beans. WIll be making this again."
10095635,69990,2014-01-19,3,"It was okay. Halfway through baking, I needed to drain off excess liquid in the pan. The flavor was fine if you like oregano chicken. Maybe try varying the seasoning to find something we would like better--maybe Italian seasoning or a 2/3 basil-to-1/3 oregano mixture."
285039,69990,2014-02-21,5,Delicious!
1802683915,69990,2014-05-07,1,Way too overpowering with the parmesan!
1803254349,69990,2014-10-22,0,Very disappointed in this ho hum recipe....... Sorry.
1803302703,69990,2014-11-05,0,"I found this very salty and sort of greasy. I&#039;ll probably make it again, but next time I&#039;ll not add any extra salt. The parmesan cheese was salty enough. The other change I&#039;d make is to bake it on a rack; I had to syphon off grease half-way through baking them. I wanted them to be a bit crispy, or at least not so greasy. I served them with spaghetti, marinara, and a salad. My family liked them, but I expected them to be better. Still, it&#039;s a recipe I can adjust with different spices."
1742738,69990,2014-12-02,4,"Cut the salt and oregano and you have a real winner.  We like garlic, so when we make this recipe for wings, we added garlic pwr."
2495818,69990,2015-01-11,5,"Followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added 10 minutes under the broiler to crisp them up a bit.  Absolutely delicious!"
45040906,69990,2015-01-14,0,"Regardless of how addicting these are, using the word Heroin in the title of a recipe seems a bit over the top."
1803496025,69990,2015-01-27,5,"This one&#039;s a keeper! The only thing I did differently, as another commenter did, was to run them under the broiler until they were crisp and nicely browned (mine took 7 min under the broiler after baking for 25 min at 350). I might decrease or omit the salt next time, but otherwise this recipe is delicious! Served mine with homemade potato wedge fries and green beans. I suggest serving sides that won&#039;t compete too much with the chicken, as it is beyond flavorful!!"
1803702565,69990,2015-02-10,5,So tasty and easy. I was skeptical but its really delicious.
1072593,69990,2015-05-20,5,"Curse you, curse you heroin chicken tenders!!! Curse you for using me to achieve your own ambitions and then just leaving me here...alone.  I think it may be time for some professional help."
2000233556,69990,2015-05-29,2,"If this recipe is indicative of how addictive heroin is, then I feel it&#039;s safe for me to try heroin.   Neither myself or my family cared for this recipe much at all.  Generally, I make an assumption that the ingredients of a recipe will join together to make a new flavor, much like flour, eggs, milk, sugar, etc. combine to make a cake.  You don&#039;t taste the individual ingredients.  This is not the case with this recipe.  It tastes exactly like what it is. chicken that was dredged in butter and parmesean.  I really like all of those things, but not like this.  The butter and parmesean join to make a paste that is really not good.  I guess I was expecting a crunchy crust, perhaps my expectations were unrealistic.  
I gave the recipe 2 stars because I believe 1 star should be reserved for food that is literally inedible.  This is not inedible, but I have a feeling my dog will end up with the leftovers after they go untouched in the fridge for a few days."
2000272630,69990,2015-06-15,3,"This recipe is okay. Taste good but a little salty. I added garlic powder, red pepper flakes and Spike all purpose seasoning. I read the comments about the chicken being greasy so i cooked mines on my counter top grill. I also finished it in my broiler. 
This is a low carb recipe but for one tender it has almost 600 calories and 36 grams of fat. I dont think it&#039;s worth it. I may try this recipe again but i actually preferred the breaded parmesan chicken over this."
2148800,69990,2015-12-21,5,I made this for supper tonight.  My hubby and I both enjoyed it.  I agree with other reviews that it was a tad on the salty side and there was a lot of oil.  I figured it would be oily so I just used my baster to remove the excess oil.  It wasn&#039;t salty to the point of inedible so we didn&#039;t have a problem.  I will definitely make this again but I&#039;ll probably use half the salt.  Yummy!  :-)
2000951620,69990,2016-04-01,5,Yummy! Made with butter noodles and omg!! Definitly making it again and again
2000202734,69990,2016-05-01,5,I made this but used half ground almonds and half Parmesan cheese and about 1/2 the salt. I took them to a potluck and they were a hit.
2001142980,69990,2016-08-26,0,"I just made this but was somewhat disappointed , way too much oregano ! It overpowered the other spices . I would make it again but cut back on the oregano and put the chicken on a rack so they could get crisper. They were swimming in the butter"
2001230956,69990,2016-11-03,3,"a bit salty,too much of butter and bit overpower of herbs as well?? can do it better next time."
2001389874,69990,2017-02-13,3,Super soggy and soo greasy. Mediocre flavor. While my husband and child both enjoyed them I couldn't eat them.
1816984,69990,2017-03-17,4,Based on a few reviews I did tweak a bit. Used 1/2 Parm &amp; 1/2 bread crumbs. Because these were for children I also cut down on seasonings. I don't know why people found these greasy or soggy. Ours were perfect! Good basic recipe that you can change up to suit your own taste.
2001446797,69990,2017-03-20,5,"We really enjoyed this. I, however, made a little boo-boo; I grabbed lemon dill seasoning rather than oregano. It turned out delicious."
2000634804,69990,2017-09-20,5,"Made these tonight. So so good. Definitley a keeper. Served with stewed tomatoes, peas and chips."
2001470991,69990,2017-11-02,5,"This recipe was absolutely outstanding. I just made a few tweaks. I used Hungarian paprika instead of regular paprika much more flavorful and used garlic powder and Italian seasoning to my cheese mixture. I baked them in the oven on my wire rack for 25 minutes then broiled them for 7 minutes turning them once. The rack lets all the excess butter run off the this way they are not soggy but very moist tenders and they come out crispier and not soggy, My family loves these and I make them on a weekly basis along with french style green beans with onions, bacon, garlic and saute this in a pan with 2 tbsp olive oil."
2002056037,69990,2018-03-17,4,"Cut the amount of oregano in half and was still too much, may try the other half of my tenders with no oregano. Used olive instead of butter, going to try peanut oil next batch."
2002082048,69990,2018-03-29,5,"Oh my goodness, I made these for my son he could not believe how good they were. Next time I used chicken breast sliced he says this is definitely something he wants on a regular basis. I'm happy case it's easy yet people think you spent a lot of time making it. Thank you so much."
2002136223,69990,2018-04-30,5,"This turned out so good! I took the advice from other reviewers and made some small adjustments: no salt, half the oregano, added garlic powder, used olive oil instead of butter, and baked on a rack. I'm definitely making this on the regular! Thank you!"
2002109604,69990,2018-09-18,5,"Very tasty,"
2002370317,69990,2018-12-17,5,"This is a pretty good recipe. Though not a knock on the finished product, the amounts are overkill. I have successfully used the basic recipe for three pounds of chicken tenders. BTW, make sure the tenders are at room temperature as cold from the fridge congeals the butter quick. And this exact recipe is on several websites."
567897,419849,2010-05-10,5,I didn't like okra until I had it fried.  This is just as good as fried without the calories and not slimy at all!!
1141443,419849,2010-07-14,4,"Delicious! Easy, tasty, and it has to be healthier than fried, right?  What a great way to use my CSA okra!"
1162266,419849,2011-07-14,5,Love this!! Quick and easy...added a little cumin and it was great. Will make again cause I got 14 rows of okra to do someting with lol!
1630841,419849,2012-08-14,5,"This is my Newest Favortie Way to Eat OKRA!  You've got to try it!  If you like spicey stuff then reach for the garlic powder, cumin, and even crushed red pepper!  OMG!  Great stuff and hardly any calories at all!  I usually just spray a squirt or two of Canola spray on the okra then dust with seasonings!   YuMMY!"
2002270704,419849,2018-09-09,5,"A whole new way to enjoy okra. I sprinkled salt, pepper and cumin on; they are soft and taste a lot like asparagus."
340141,504468,2013-07-31,3,"I tried this over cod and rice.   It was okay, but lacked some depth I would have liked (for example, from garlic).   I think I would have also preferred a 1:3 ratio of vinegar to coconut milk instead of 1:1.   I think it was a good basalmic vinegar; however, perhaps it was just a supermarket ripoff.   Zwt9"
107135,504468,2013-07-31,5,this would be good on pork .it has a nice flavor
37449,504468,2013-08-07,4,"I loved the balsamic vinegar, and thought I want more of that flavor, so maybe a little less of the coconut milk. This was so good with rice and beans, really woke up the flavors. Thanks!"
57256,57663,2004-10-03,5,"These are just wonderful !! I made 4 dozen cookies with my cookie scoop .They are lovely , crisp and flavorful , with a really nice vanilla taste . They belong in everyones cookie jar !!!! Thank You for sharing !"
332843,57663,2006-08-18,5,"I halved the recipe for this, then added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I then rolled the dough-balls in a mix of cinnamon & sugar.  They were delicious; like little snickerdoodles.  Very crispy, with a hint of cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla.  Great for snacking & not overly sweet."
124249,57663,2006-12-29,5,"I had to try this recipe. First time I have made cookies without an egg added. These were nice flavorful and slightly crisp cookies. They went very well with my hot tea. I got more than 36 cookies but that is a plus. This recipe is going in my Amish recipe collection.

That's really all I am capable of saying. These little guys are fantastic."
51931,57663,2007-10-16,5,"Thank you so much for this eggless recipe! Are sugar cookies supposed to taste like shortbread cookies? Regardless, these were awesome! Perfect for my DD who is allergic to eggs and easy enough for me to do when I am in a pinch and need to bring cookies to her preschool for Kitchen Week so she can participate and have something to eat with the rest of the kids. ETA:  DD's teachers loved these cookies and have asked for the recipe.  They used these cookies as part of kitchen week and had the kids decorate them with frosting and sprinkles.  My DD keeps asking for more.  I rolled the dough out on parchment paper (the stuff you can bake directly on), cut out my shapes and peeled away the unshaped dough leaving the shapes on the parchment paper.  If you try to pick up the shapes and put them directly on the pan, they fall apart when you lift them up.  Cutting them out directly on the baking paper was the only way I was able to keep my dough in tact. Then I slid my baking pan under the paper and baked for 10 minutes. Thanks for a keeper!!!!"
669519,57663,2008-02-12,5,I wanted to make sugar cookies for v-day and when I took the recipe i had to the kitchen i discovered i didn't have any eggs! After looking around a bit i found this recipe and to be honest i was a bit skeptic. They turned out great tho. They just finished cooling and they are crisp and flavorful. Great recipe. Thanks!
197456,57663,2010-12-24,5,"These were awesome!  Thanks to Trixyinaz, I did the trick of rolling on parchment then cutting out.  I did half a recipe and got 24 cookies, with some dough left over... probably would have gotten about 30 cookies. I also found that 9 minutes was enough for my oven. They do remind me of a shortbread cookie more than a sugar cookie.. but very good all the same!   thanks for sharing this recipe!"
377929,57663,2011-01-16,5,"I first made these for my grandson who was allergic to eggs. I honestly didn't know if they would turn out after reading the recipe but they are now our favorite cookie. In fact, my husband just requested a batch :) They are a lovely tea or coffee cookie. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It's the best!!!!"
315055,57663,2011-04-14,5,"OMGosh!  These are TDF...my son who is allergic to eggs will be so super happy this Easter!  I made a half batch as a trial as I'm picky about my sugar cookies, but wanted him to have some as well.  These are so good this is my new sugar cookie recipe of choice, thanks so much for posting.  Truly melt-in-your-mouth good!"
1891568,57663,2011-04-22,0,"My husband is allergic to eggs so I was very excited to find this recipe. He loves these cookies, we all love them. I made a batch for my daughter to take to school for a class party and they were a BIG hit!!!  The teachers were asking for a copy of the recipe and if they could have the left over cookies to take home. I have also substituted almond flavoring for the vanilla as well as lemon."
2238403,57663,2012-04-14,3,"Good recipe for hand formed/shaped cookies but not for cut outs.  Hard to roll out and cookies lost their shape when baked.  A bit on the sweet side.  I know they're sugar cookies, but still."
2580987,57663,2012-12-24,1,"This recipe stinks!  I would love to give it zero stars.  It was too crumbly to hand roll into balls and INCREDIBLY greasy!  We tried adding some milk to combat the crumbliness, but to no avail.  My mom searched for eggless CUT-OUTS and this recipe came up.  There is no way you can roll out these cookies.  And if you do manage to roll the dough the cookies break when you try to transfer them to a cookie sheet.  My son is allergic to eggs and we were really hoping this would be a good one, but NO WAY!  What a waste of time, ingredients and money!"
132383,57663,2013-12-11,5,"Well, I love this recipe!  These DO taste like butter cookies, but then again I accidentally used a tablespoon of Butter extract instead of Vanilla!  I also ran out of flour and my last full cup had to be supplemented with bread flour.  After they baked, I tasted one and the first thought that came to my mind was the butter cookies in those little blue tins...which I love!!  I can&#039;t comment on how they taste with vanilla (but I&#039;ll do them again this weekend and see).  My daughter is allergic to eggs so we went on the hunt like everyone else.  The dough is pretty runny and not the best for rolling out cookies.  However, I chilled the dough a bit and worked with it in batches.  I would make a good size ball in my hand, press it out with the palm of my hand on wax paper.  Then I peeled the wax paper off and flipped it over (so I would have the flat side).  I used a cookie cutter and then picked the whole thing up in my hand, turning the cookie cutter over and getting the excess dough off around it....then flipped the cookie cutter over onto my silpat lined cookie sheet.  (Clear as mud?).  I then refrigerated the cookie dough before baking for about 10-12 minutes.  The dough still ran a little bit but I am happy....the extra effort is worth it for my daughter.  I&#039;m posting pictures....I did half of the batch in starfish cutouts (for an underwater themed birthday) and half the batch in small letters.  Thank you!!!"
2000254311,57663,2015-06-07,5,"I hope you see this to the original poster. My name is Zana, imagine my surprise when I saw the name of this recipe!!"
88099,237394,2007-08-25,5,"Excellent flavor and easy to put together.  Dave will have these eaten by the end of the day, so no need to freeze them.  I made your recipe #97361, using 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.  Thanks Paula."
169430,237394,2007-07-21,5,"I made these this morning for a Saturday brekkie on the deck. I used a low fat whole wheat biscuit recipe, veggie Canadian bacon, Eggbeaters (Southwest flavored) and fat free cheese, I tucked 4 into the freezer (a great idea). These are very tasty and would be perfect for carry along and brown bagging. I think the guys could down 4 if not all 6. Very simple to make and easy to enjoy."
166642,237394,2007-10-23,5,A wonderful and delicious morning breakfast. I halved the recipe and make it exactly as stated. Defintely worth of 5 stars! I am going to try it next time with your sourdough whole wheat biscuits. I bet those taste fantastic.
252816,237394,2008-04-05,5,"My DH liked these..A nice change from the usual breakfast..Not as unhealthy as McD""s..I used english muffins,I toasted them with a small amount of butter..I assembled  as recipe states but added a quatered slice of american cheese to each,placed on top the canadian bacon to help hold the sandwich together..Next time I will use more eggs and use my giant muffin pans as the egg pattie was really too small and needed more coverage on the muffin..."
93997,237394,2008-04-22,5,This was very good. Made as directed except used pre-cooked microwave bacon instead of canadian bacon. Great tip using a muffin tin for round egg patties. Will make these often. Thanks for sharing!
268058,237394,2008-08-10,5,"Great easy breakfast idea. Hubby had one this morning ! 
Thanks for posting."
37868,237394,2009-01-22,4,Like always I come to Zaar to find a recipe and here it is. I used Pillsbury Frozen Biscuits. I also used my muffin tins for the eggs. That worked really well for the size of biscuits I used. I used Jimmy Dean Sausage Patties. My Brother likes his with strawberry jam. I wrapped each biscuit in plastic wrap and placed in a freezer bag for freezen. I am sure these will be good!!! Thank You
217898,237394,2009-09-04,5,I am making a batch for hubby to have in the mornings!    This is the idea I was looking for!   Thanks so much!
1456844,237394,2009-11-22,0,"This is exactly what I was looking for, Thanks!!!"
171683,237394,2011-08-29,5,"I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this recipe - I made these a year ago when school was starting and DS needed to have a quick but filling breakfast for High School.  I made them with high fiber English muffins and pre-cooked bacon (DS like bacon egg sand), and they were really good. DS thought they were too dry - that may be because of the Eng. muffin, but I really didn't want the added fat & cal of a biscuit.  I will be making these again, this time for DD who starts middle school, and who really liked them.  Very easy to put together (especially using pre-cooked bacon), and very tasty."
146310,96063,2005-09-15,5,These are a heavenly little take on sugar cookies.
33159,96063,2009-06-28,4,I agree with the first poster - very similar to sugar cookies but with a brown sugar variation.  Cookies are soft & chewy or nice & crunchy depending on your bake time.  This is a great little recipe for a quick snack using very common ingredients!
60992,96063,2009-07-01,5,These are really good cookies. They remind me much more of sugar cookies than shortbread however. I got closer to 6 dozen as I rolled the dough into about 1 inch balls before pressing with the fork. The brown sugar adds a bit more depth than your regular sugar cookie. A nice little change up from the ordinary.
46660,44980,2002-11-06,5,"This was excellent!  As many before me have said, another great recipe Inez!  We grilled outdoors, since we live in Phoenix and it is never really too cold to go outside :) I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I mixed some merlot, vinegar, and a touch of balsamic vinegar together to equal 1/4 cup.  My whole family and I are licking our fingers!  Thanks!"
90478,44980,2003-11-25,5,"Great way to cook chicken.  Never had it on the barbecue yet, but there's time for that yet.  My boyfriend loves it and his brothers always want to come over when I am cooking it! Thanks"
207010,44980,2005-05-04,5,I have tried this recipe on chicken and pork chops. It's delicious!
128473,44980,2006-05-04,5,"Yes! You Rock MizzNezz what a great recipe. Sweet, tangy, finger licking good. Quick and easy to make. I baked the chicken in the oven.  The sauce coated the chicken thighs  perfectly. I will certainly make this again. I can't wait to grill it. Thanks so much for sharing."
237875,44980,2006-06-04,5,Very tasty barbeque sauce.  I liked the idea of reserving a little sauce to serve with the chicken - best if it's served warm.
187373,286322,2011-02-20,5,"Tasty strawberry bread Chicagoland Chef!  I had some strawberries in the freezer to use, so made a half recipe (one loaf) and subbed some whole wheat flour in place of some of the flour and used half applesauce/half oil.  Turned out great!  Oh, and added some nuts for crunch!  Thanks so much for posting!  Made for bargain basement tag game."
27783,86727,2004-03-29,5,"Very good!  Roasting the veggies gave this a nice flavor.  Smooth & reamy, even though there is no milk or cream added.  I liked the flavor of the thyme in this very much."
1318331,86727,2009-07-08,5,"Amazing soup! I've also made this with half the butter and substituting beef broth, which gave it a more savory flavor."
246482,86727,2010-10-12,5,"This was the first time I made a squash soup and this was easy and oh so good. My husband had never tasted Butternut squash soup and he loved it Easy to make and tastes great.Thanks for posting My husband said"" dont lose the recipe."""
50509,86727,2011-01-17,5,"A very good soup. I used perhaps 1 1/2 lbs of squash, reduced the other ingredients, used one large jonagold apple, as that was what I had. As I had only dried thyme, I added it with the broth. Roasting the squash, etc., this morning as I was getting ready for work made this very easy to finish for dinner."
101301,101299,2005-04-27,5,"Delicious...one word says it all, the garlic adds great but subtle flavor. It took almost a whole bulb of garlic to get a quarter cup though."
107231,101299,2006-05-16,5,"Okay, I admit I cheated on this recipe by using garlic salt in place of the garlic due to time and the recipe still came out tasting like the potatoes Applebee's serves! I cut the red potatoes in fourths so they would cook quicker since I doubled the recipe.  I used a pastry cutter to mash the potatoes so the texture would be a little lumpy rather than a masher.  Results were so tasty!"
191015,101299,2006-07-09,5,I've tried other garlic mashed potato recipes (not from recipe zaar) and never cared for them.  This recipe is perfect.  It has the perfect amount of garlic and roasting the garlic first made it perfect!
356713,101299,2006-11-22,3,"Personally I didnt like the heavy cream taste in these potatoes.  I love these when I go to Applebee's and I was excited to make them.  I think maybe next time I will just use milk as I thought the cream taste was overpowering (or maybe its just because I really hate cream!). Anyway, I think they are worth a second chance..."
133174,101299,2007-05-20,5,"I made these to go with recipe #111562 and they were wonderful.  I am not sure how close to Applebee's they are because I can't remember eating mashed potatoes at Applebee's.  The only change I made was to warm the milk, cream and butter until the butter melted.  The roasted garlic is wonderful."
454804,101299,2007-05-22,5,These were really good. I didn't think they tasted a lot like Applebee's but they were still good. I thought they didn't have enough garlic flavor despite adding garlic powder and garlic salt to the boiling water. I added garlic salt & g.powder to the finished product then they were too garlicky so I fixed it by making some more potatoes with no garlic which made them almost perfect. I peeled some of the potatoes & left some with skins. I also quartered them like Lorrie before cooking to speed things up. I will definatley make again.
1448648,101299,2009-12-22,5,"Delicious! Heavenly!  They are so good that you hate putting anything on top of them!  But even with gravy the taste still comes through wonderfully!  I also put a cup of shredded cheddar cheese in mine.  I love that you don't have to peel the potatoes.  When you make these, your family will think you are the best cook in the world.  Thanks for the recipe!"
703661,101299,2009-12-23,5,made these exactly as directed and they were so good.  thanks for sharing.  i think i will have to eat mashed potatoes like this forever.
1506644,101299,2010-01-01,5,"Loved it! I made this recipe today but I added my own twist to it.  Everything was eyeballing and to taste.  First off, I didn't have whole garlic at home.  I puree my garlic, so I added about 3 teaspoons maybe 4.  I had to taste it because I didn't want to over power it with the garlic.  Everything else was put on as the ingredients say.  I will make this again."
140132,101299,2010-01-05,4,Very good potato recipe.  I made this to go with a smoked brisket dinner we made and it was a hit.  I did add some grated cheddar cheese in the end.  Thank you for sharing.
1565956,101299,2010-03-07,5,So delish :) my boyfriend & i both thought it tasted pretty darn close to applebees-the only thing i will differently is to make the potatoes a little more lumpy (more like applebees)
1685328,101299,2010-09-15,5,"A fantastic and accurate clone.  I will most definitely be making this again.<br/>I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so I substituted additional milk for heavy cream and added an extra tablespoon of butter to maintain the fat content."
1744701,101299,2010-11-26,5,These are the best!!! I love these mashed potatoes and since i got pregnant they are all i want to eat but can not afford to go to applebees so much they taste just like applebees!!
382203,101299,2011-02-12,5,These were a great addition to my dinner last night.  Thanks
2001313099,101299,2016-12-22,5,This is the best mashed! Should have searched this earlier. I'm passing this along to my kids
2000640547,101299,2017-08-15,5,"The best way to roast the garlic is to take an entire head, slice off the top and drizzle a tbsp. of olive oil over it. Wrap it in aluminum foil and bake in the oven at 350 until soft. Let it cool to where it can be handled and squeeze each clove directly into the potatoes as you mash them. You CANNOT replace the roasted garlic with garlic powder or garlic salt or any kind of fresh garlic without totally changing the flavor profile of the dish. Roasted garlic does not taste like fresh garlic, it has a much richer and fuller flavor with none of the after taste or garlic breath. It is also fantastic if you mix it with a bit of softened butter to spread on a nice fresh baguette. :)"
295353,108933,2006-07-15,5,"This was delicious!  It was pretty easy to make and tasted perfect.  I wish I had made more.  The ""salsa"" ready made the dish.  Thank you!"
53932,108933,2006-08-26,5,Loved the salsa!  This makes a really nice salad.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
2310,44445,2003-01-24,5,"I love this recipe.  I decided to vary it a little bit by omitting the cheese.  Then I used one sheet of phyllo to make egg roll sized strudels and baked for around 30 minutes until light brown.  I served them with some Carrot Ginger soup and it made a nice, light supper.  I'll bet they would be great as a little appetizer and can be made ahead of time, kept in the refrigerator just before baking. Thanks LDJ for posting such an interesting and delicious recipe."
128473,483327,2012-07-26,5,"My dh absolutely loved this dish diner, he ate most of it himself...he did leave me a nice sized peice, so I can't complain.  It was so good.  Good thing I scaled it down for the two of us.  Creamy, tender, cheesy and oh so flavorful.  All the flavors blended beautifully together to create this wonderful dish.  I used extra old white cheese, it was really nice in this dish.  Made exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.  We will be having this dish again and again.  I have placed it in my keeper box.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Made for The Fearless Red Dragons - ZWT8 - Spain."
560491,483327,2012-07-29,5,Great potatoes!!  I used my mandolin to slice the potatoes and onions so they were the same thickness and used a couple of pieces of bacon left from breakfast that were already cooked.  I liked that the potatoes were not dried out and not soupy either.  I topped it with Spanish Manchego cheese.  Made for ZWT8.
226863,483327,2013-03-02,5,"I cut this recipe down for two, and think I got the measurements right because it turned out great!  I did use the optional bacon, but think I may actually leave it out next time.  I'll be making this easy recipe again! Thanks for sharing....made for PRMR tag game."
296809,173904,2006-06-30,5,"Do all your recipes generate a strange behavioural response? After recovering from “Ferris Wheel Chicken Salad”, I gave another of yours a try. All went well early on (calm b4 the storm). Prep was a snap using my hand-held blender tool, I tasted it, swooned w/delight & then it happened! I began to dance around our condo & sing the “Chiquita Banana Song”! Siggi got home from work & I had to be restrained while he ate the rest of the dessert to shut me up. At least the cat stayed clear of me this time. I used a candied apricot/pineapple mix, tiny choc chips & slivered almonds for toppings. (Chocolate was a must!) This was such a treat. I suspect you could put a Dairy Queen outlet out of business serving this little gem! Thx SQ."
104295,173904,2006-09-18,5,"This is so much better then the sum of its parts.  I made the frozen mixture (using splenda and fat free half & half) and thought ""this is ok.""  Add it to the fresh banana (which I simply broke up and put into my container) and add a few toppings (Yes, chocolate is a must here!) and this is divine."
179252,116610,2005-05-06,5,This is just awesome.  Now if asparagus season was only longer.
422893,203790,2007-07-25,4,"I thought this sounde4d interesting but made it as a breakfast pudding rather than dessert. I changed it a bit to suit my tastes, I did a half batch, not a ginger fan so left it out & also left out the sugar as I thought the molasses would be sweet enough for me. To jazz it up a bit I also added a handful frozen mixed berries. Served it warm with some vanilla yoghurt for a very tasty brekky. Thanks!"
202555,203790,2007-08-15,5,"I love recipes like this and it sounded interesting. I added raisins and my family loved it. I think when we get back to basics, we are getting back to some of the best.
Thanks for posting!!"
493738,203790,2008-01-10,4,"Yum!  This is definitely comfort food.  The pudding part was very creamy, and it had a very mild flavor.  If you like strong foods, you'd have to increase the sugar and add some spices.  I'll be keeping this one--thanks, bshemyshua!"
337963,238380,2007-09-16,4,"Hubby really liked this!  On our barbeque it took an hour with indirect heat on high.  I marinated the meat for 8 hours which made it very moist, but the wonderful  flavor didn't penetrate to the center of the tenderloin.  I would definitely make this again, perhaps scoring the meat and preseasoning the pork with some salt along with the pepper.  Really beautiful presentation too, so this would be a good dish for company.  Thanks for a keeper Mareesme!"
465080,376330,2010-09-08,3,"Even with a little extra garlic, this recipe came out tasting too 'eggy'.  The egg was fresh from my hen house today.  Won't use this as a garnish or spread, but will use it as a noodle base.  I think that it would be better without the yolk."
531799,296874,2008-04-11,4,"Being so easy, this was right down my alley.  I had to run an errand after work.  I stopped by the house, put this together quickly, popped it into the oven and left.  I returned to find a perfectly delicious dish and a great aroma in the air.  My only changes were I used chicken tenders, threw in a cup of french fried onions also and used a 300 setting on the oven in case I had a delay.  DH and I really enjoyed it.  Will certainly be making again.  Thank you for sharing."
22788,296874,2008-04-11,5,"This was an easy recipe to put together. Since I am alone, my chicken was just 4 plump chicken drumsticks (no attached thigh). I cut the rest of the ingredients in half as I knew that would be ample for my chicken.
The instructions did not say whether or not to cover while baking....I chose to cover the baking dish. After the recommended cooking time, I uncovered to check.....and found the sauce to be very thin. So I uncovered the dish and baked another 15-20 mins. That really didn't thicken the sauce much....so I just set it on the stovetop to cool abit while I  threw some rice on to cook. When the rice was done....wow...the sauce had thicken nicely in that short setting time.
The sauce was very tasty on the chicken and on its own.....but I did not care for it as a sauce for the rice. I will keep the recipe to use just as I did.....a sauce for the chicken drumsticks. It would make a nice appetizer for the times I have company over.
I also want to make note of the fact that I  used wholeberry cranberry sauce and it worked just fine. I couldn't see buying the jellied when I already had a few cans of the wholeberry on hand. Thank you for sharing your recipe with me."
47559,94098,2006-04-22,5,"I'd never had garlic bread with tomatoes and a good layer of cheese like this before.  I loved it!  It's very filling, and a few slices with a salad would be a satisfying lunch!  Wonderful flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe. "
47892,94098,2006-10-13,5,"For this recipe I chose pecorino romano. If there's a choice between pecorino and another cheese, I always choose the former. Used fresh garlic too. Treated this dish as a main dish and served alongside tossed green salad and pear sauce."
386585,94098,2013-04-17,5,"This was absolutely perfect, and the perfect complement to our Italian dinner.  Believe it or not, the tomato was the extra touch that made this really stand out.  We love garlic bread, and the proportion of ingredients in this recipe are just right.  I did use garlic powder, and followed the recipe exactly as posted.  Thanks for posting this new favorite!  Made for Spring PAC 2013."
1179225,94098,2014-10-28,5,Yummy! I love garlic bread and the tomato in this recipe  was a scrumptious addition. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
37449,361001,2009-03-29,5,Oh so yummy! I made this for breakfast and cheated a little and used canned whipped cream! Thanks Nasseh!
343228,361001,2009-09-10,4,"This was pretty good. I didn't chop the bananas. instead I split it in half and scooped the cream/date mixture into it kinda like a banana split... just something fun for the kids. 
thanks for a nice recipe."
678366,361001,2009-12-29,5,What a nice dessert! DDs licked their fingers and so did I. My whipping cream was sweet already so I didn't have to add any sugar. Thanks.
593927,361001,2010-03-26,5,I used Deleget Noor dates and I did not whip the heavy whipping cream as DD (toddler) was asleep. I sprinkled dark brown sugar on top instead or mixing it in. It was OK with cinnamon but I preferred it without! Made for Went to the Market Tag - March '10.
25792,32311,2003-01-19,5,"GinnyP you are right this is wonderful to have on hand, in fact I'm making more for the freezer.  I have used it on grilled steaks and then dotted it over sliced potatoes and onions in foil packets on the grill.  Can't wait to try  it on some fresh hot bread I'm making.  This is great!  TY"
1533,32311,2005-03-30,5,"Hi Ginny, I make this all the time now and have it in the freezer. Its great for the bbq and i love adding it to mashed potatoed.. there is so many uses for it, thanks."
139350,32311,2007-04-03,5,"I LOVE basil, but I've never thought of adding it to garlic butter.  What a great idea!  I made this recipe with 1/2 lb. of soft margarine but used the full amount of garlic and parmesan cheese with fabulous results.  Wonderful on garlic toast and baked potatoes (and probably a lot of other things)!"
43921,20937,2002-06-12,5,"This is a very moist banana bread.  My little girls love it!  Thanks! Incidentally, the recipe doubles very easily, which is good news for large families..."
230124,127167,2005-07-19,5,"These are the best baked onions I have ever tasted!  The Italian dressing makes them sing!  Don't get me wrong though, they taste good without it too!"
4470,127167,2006-03-27,5,Lovely onions- I found that 30 minutes was just right - I like them still a bit crunchy.  Next time I will open up the foil for the last 15 minutes pour on the Italian dressing and place them under the broiler to brown a bit.  I took pictures but they did not do the recipe justice so I didn't post them I will make the recipe again so maybe next time a picture too
2002154629,193325,2018-05-16,0,not tried it yet. concerned re the sour cream as 3/4 cup yet you say 1 cup (8 oz)
949568,484223,2012-08-08,5,"Wow, I really liked the lime juice and honey on these, gave it a bright sweet taste.  We were grilling and actually ran out of gas before they were quite done, but it didn't stop us from enjoying them!  Made for ZWT8 trip to Australia / New Zealand.  Thanks Mikekey!"
178427,484223,2012-08-11,5,Delicious! I loved the honey and lime on these. Thanks for sharing. Made for ZWT 8.
296027,484223,2012-08-12,5,What a delicious treat to end a BBQ meal!  I enjoyed the honey and lime flavors paired with the grilled bananas.  My DS also enjoyed this with me.  Thanks!  *Made for ZWT8 2012*
149363,484223,2012-08-12,5,"This simple recipe is a great way to end a summer meal. They bananas had a great consistency, they didn't get mushy at all and the honey lime flavour came through in just the right amount. We loved this healthy dessert, thanks Mikekey! Made for ZWT 8 :)"
1072593,484223,2012-08-26,5,Loved this and I'm on my final leg of ZWT and my plan of destruction by overeating is just about over.  Made for ZWT#8~Australia/Family Picks.
2399085,484223,2012-12-10,4,"Great use of bananas, kids really enjoyed them. Thanks for the recipe!"
179456,107922,2005-02-26,5,"No, they are not the kind of chips you get when you fry them in oil, but they are quite good for what they are; a sensible chip that tastes just fine.  I dipped these in a black bean dip.  Thanks for a guilt-free recipe :)"
289443,107922,2007-07-19,5,"This is a very healthy, tasty recipe.  I like to have them at parties as a healthier option and people appreciate that.  Thanks for the recipe!"
139381,107922,2007-07-20,5,"Wonderful, health conscious snack! These are delicious and addictive. I also discovered parmesan cheese is another wonderful option....as is Old Bay seasoning. Thanks!"
666723,107922,2008-04-01,5,"I can't stop eating these.  I thought I had cumin but didn't so I used ground coriander instead along with the chili powder, and a little sprinkle of salt and pepper.  The tortillas I had on hand were the jalapeno flavored flour tortillas and they worked great.  They were perfectly crisp after 17 minutes.  These are super easy to whip up and I liked snacking on them right out of the oven!  I bet you can really experiment with the seasonings on these!  Thanks for the great idea."
296809,107922,2008-05-23,5,"I love little recipes like this that are easy quick-fixes & healthy, but tasty too! I used lrg sun-dried tomato flavored tortillas & cut them in dipper size like Fritos Scoops. I did not have a mister so used my pastry brush to lightly brush the lime & oil mixture, & I also added garlic to the spice mix. I served them w/Recipe #289431 by Annacia ~ a yummy good combo! Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
96177,107922,2009-01-08,5,How simple and I love the fact that they're baked not fried. The flavors of the cumin and lime make a great flavor. Made for zaar tag.
5060,107922,2009-07-11,5,"very good and crispy too!  I made them to use with some pico de gallo and to crush and top off some black beans. They served both pruposes perfectly.  I don't have a mister so I whisked the cumin , lime juice and chili powder together and brushed it on with my pasty brush.  My tortillas were Jalepeno type, very simple and quick recipe, baked in abot 8 minutes, just made half a recipe and wished I had made the whole one!
thanks for posting."
1385785,107922,2009-09-16,5,Really good!
1256820,107922,2010-11-08,5,"I used to deep fry my chips....this is so simple, and so much healthier!  I love recipes like this!  O, and is tasty:)"
2543218,107922,2012-12-04,3,"I skipped the spices (I'll add them for round two - once I buy a lime!), but found the bake time to be too long.  My chips came out brown and almost burnt.  Maybe 5 and 5 for a total bake time of 10 minutes rather than 14?"
428885,206276,2008-04-22,5,"Oh wonderful asparagus~and oh wonderful asparagus 2 ways. The days are busy here on Longmeadow with times coming fast and furious, but what a delicious treat and very special way to have a supper on a Monday evening. The fresh asparagus just begs to be used in the really easy more then *WOW* recipe. It really doesn't take much to prepare, in fact, I put the roux and asparagus together on low heat for 30 minutes and it basically cooked itself. This only takes minutes to put together; the roux,and (besides) whirling this up in the food processor, adjust seasonings you have your sauce and if you don't just eat it right out of the pot, you might save it for topping a omelet like we did. I also threw in some roasted garlic that was hanging out in the fridge waiting to be used. Perfect ~ Perfect~ and a good choice for anyway  you wish to use it! Thank you, twissis Made for *Everyday is a Holiday* April 2008"
123555,83154,2006-02-23,5,"Great appetizer.  You can mix the cheese, onion and bacon ahead of time and refridgerate.  At the last minute spread and bake.  I used my food processor since I don't have a meat grinder and it worked very well."
123897,31558,2005-01-02,5,Made a batch of this and used it to bake a cake and a beer bread. It worked very well as both rose beautifully!
116401,31558,2005-11-19,5,"Huge thanks!Wanted to try out a new bread recipe before I made it for Thanksgiving, but found myself with NO Baking powder!Your recipe saved me a lot of time and effort--thanks again, PeggyLynn"
3205,31558,2006-01-07,5,I didn't realize I had run out of baking powder and had to make some lemon bread.  I remembered this recipe and made a batch.  Worked great.  Thanks.
168896,31558,2006-11-07,5,worked great; so good to have this info on hand!  thanks for sharing.
59064,31558,2007-06-11,5,It works! And it saved me a trip to the supermarket :)
375884,31558,2008-03-08,5,I'm in the middle of a blizzard here in Ohio and I wanted to make biscuits.  I then realized I had no baking powder.  What a life saver this was!
209447,31558,2009-01-06,5,Thanks for a great quick fix.
727055,31558,2009-01-12,5,"What a money saver. I swear my baking is twice as light and fluffly with this than the stale store bought stuff. I have tried other recipes that didn't include the cornstarch, but didn't like them as much since the baking powder seemded to clump together too much. I have been using this for the past 6 months and I won't ever buy it again from the store. THank you for sharing!"
1015092,31558,2009-04-01,5,Worked for me! I was making waffles and didn't realize I was out of baking powder.  This was a great sub.
294000,31558,2010-01-16,5,Fantastic!  I know I've got baking powder somewhere!  But I got sick of searching and this was so simple.  Thank you!
452940,31558,2011-06-16,0,"I saw this posted in 'Cooking Light' magazine (Nov 2008) and it calls for 2 parts cream of tartar and 1 part each of baking soda and cornstarch (ie: 1 Tbsp cream of tartar and 1/2 Tbsp each of baking soda and cornstarch).  I'm sure both ways work well. I was going to post the recipe, but saw you had it here. Thanks for sharing. :)"
101823,116610,2005-04-14,5,"Pairing bacon and asparagus is such a winning idea.  Adding garlic is even better.  We loved these bundles as a side to our Mustard Lamb Chops (#11581), but could also see these being served as the main course with a salad and rice pilaf.  Our garlic did burn a bit as we waited for the bacon to crisp.  In the future, we will drizzle the bunches of asparagus with the garlic before wrapping with bacon, in order to keep the tender garlic away from the high heat.  I can't wait for my own fresh asparagus to start producing."
64154,116610,2005-04-25,5,"Great. We loved the flavor the steeped garlic, parsley and olive oil gave the asparagus."
153188,116610,2005-05-11,5,"These were fantastic!!!!!!!!!!  I loved the bacon and the garlic...mmmmm.  I didn't use toothpics to hold the bacon to the asparagus, and I used extra bacon instead of just one slice.  I took 2 slices per 4 asparagus and put them in an X fashion.  I then took the top and alternate bottom of the bacon and I tied them across the asparagus and I did the same with the other side.   Worked wonderfully.  Will definitely be a regular staple in my house from now on."
210495,116610,2005-05-29,5,I have made this recipes at least four times in the past few weeks!  It is an excellent make-ahead appetizer for company and looks so impressive on the plate!  I didn't need the toothpicks I just wrapped the bacon and made sure the 'end' piece was tucked under the bottom of the bundle.  Tasted  delicious and everyone raved about it.
219352,116610,2005-06-04,5,"This was so good, my guests thpught it was great too!  So easy!"
189643,116610,2005-06-14,5,I made my bundles a little bigger-6 stalks. The aroma from the garlic and bacon!! Delicious! I'll make this whenever I have asparagus. Attractive dish for company too. Thanks!
185285,116610,2005-11-21,5,"Heavenly.  I served it with a mushroom ravioli in alfredo sauce that was fantastic. GREAT way to get DH's to eat veggies. I didn't see it in the instructions, but I just spinkled the parsely (I used dried) and garlic over the top before baking."
100149,116610,2005-12-26,5,"I made this for Christmas dinner, I even made extra.  Now I was warned that no one in my family liked asparagus.  They were the only part of the otherwise basically standard dinner that was ""different"".  People were complaining that I didn't make more!  So easy and beautifully presented.  I will be making this more often with regular meals as well.  "
146047,116610,2005-12-27,5,"Delicious, Marie. These were a hit with my husband and I, and a great complement to ham and mashed potatoes. Next time I might cook them for a shorter period of time at a higher temp in order to crisp the bacon a bit. Tasty as is, however! Thanks for posting."
212417,116610,2006-05-31,5,"O M G!!!! This is soooo yummy! My picky eaters will even eat this....it amazes me! I have used garlic-infused oil to rave reviews, but I like the look of the garlic on the asparagus. The trick is not to burn it! This is a keeper Marie, and thank you for posting!"
93006,116610,2006-06-19,4,"Can't go wrong, can you, with these ingredients!  Only problem I had was getting the bacon to crisp - after baking, I put under the broiler for a few minutes but still didn't quite crisp up enough for us.  But even without the bacon, very delicious!"
305531,116610,2006-07-05,5,These were terrific.  I made them ahead of time and popped them in the refrigerator until time to cook.  I just 'tied' the bacon around the bundles which worked well. No need for toothpicks.  Everyone really loved these.  Thanks for the recipe.
158086,116610,2006-09-05,5,These turned out wonderful...I made then for a dinner party I had and the presentation was perfect...I am sure I will be making these alot for company.
107554,116610,2006-11-24,5,Wonderful!  A huge hit at my holiday table.  I will make this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing Marie!
269786,116610,2006-12-28,5,"Absolutely amazing flavor, and my guests loved it!"
142335,116610,2007-03-08,5,Delicious! I had bacon and asparagus left over from another recipe so I tried this. Can anything with bacon wrapped around it ever be bad? This would be a great entertaining dish.
316469,116610,2007-03-26,5,Didn't change a thing- this recipe is perfect just as it is.
221534,116610,2007-06-04,5,"The cook time on this dish is PERFECT!  They were crisp tender and incredibly flavorful.  I didn't need toothpicks, and found one piece of bacon to work well - and sooo tasty!  The only thing I did differently was to toss the asparagus and garlic mixture in a large ziplock bag.  I will be making this ALL of the time.  Thank you for sharing Marie!"
88099,116610,2007-09-28,5,"Awesome.  Loved the flavor of these.  I didn't want to use so much bacon for each bundle, so I cut the bacon in half, vertically, and only used a half for each bundel.  Some I made with the whole strip.  I think I like the 1/2 better.  thanks so much Marie.  Made for Adopt a Tag game."
467341,116610,2007-10-14,5,My sweety told me that he didn't eat asparagus until he saw me make this.  He now requests asparagus all the time.  Thanks for helping me add one more green vegetable to his diet!
481092,116610,2007-10-27,5,Excellent as well as attractive.  I didn't saute garlic with oil and instead just drizzled plain olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt.  My asparagus were quite thin so used about 8-10 stalks per bundle and got five bundles.  Needed to cook for about 28 minutes.  Thanks for posting a company perfect recipe.
406741,116610,2007-12-04,3,"Pretty good... I realized I like my bacon more crisp, and this was still a little ""floppy."" If I make again, I'd make more garlic oil, I found I was adding just plain oil and garlic salt as I made more bundles."
593726,116610,2008-02-25,5,"Very good!  I will totally be making this again, the garlic/parsley oil is a really nice touch!"
262312,116610,2008-03-30,5,"oh dear...these are so delish!!!  i prebaked my bacon for about 10 minutes, then i tossed the asparagus with the oil, then wrapped in bacon.  i didn't need toothpicks, because i just wrapped a whole piece around the stalks.  i think precooking the bacon results in crispy bacon without overcooked asparagus.  thanks so much for such a keeper recipe!  every asparagus lover should try this...the flavor is insane!!  thanks again, marie!"
288146,116610,2008-04-22,5,YUM!  I also prebaked my bacon before wrapping the asparagus and it turned out perfect.  I didn't have time to do the oil so I just drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic powder.  They were awesome but I will definitely do it properly next time.  Thanks!
497077,116610,2008-10-31,5,"DELICIOUS! I did render my bacon in the microwave and I cooked my bundles on the grill. Everyone loved these!!! Thank you for a great recipe, Marie!Made for the Think Pink Tag Game In Honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, October 2008."
96177,116610,2009-01-05,5,"Delish. I didn't precook the bacon and thought it was just fine that way. I was out of fresh parsley, so used dried.... not a good idea, next time I'll opt for fresh. Made for New Years Day and got lots of oh's and ah's... thanks Marie, a real keeper."
30503,116610,2009-02-15,5,"This was so amazing!!! I did render the bacon before wrapping, might do it more next time because i really like my bacon crispy."
821030,116610,2009-03-17,5,Fab.  Nice flavor and texture combination.  Thanks Marie.
437587,116610,2009-03-25,5,"WOW! This was good, how can you go wrong with bacon wrapped anything? I cooked the bacon partially in the microwave before wrapping the bundles. We actually had this twice in one week because we liked it so much the first time we tried it!"
544754,116610,2009-04-16,5,"I agree, you can never go wrong with bacon wrapped ANYTHING! I cheated and took a short cut and just drizzled with olive oil and garlic powder before wrapping w/ the partially cooked bacon. I'm sure it would have been heavenly if I had taken the extra step with the garlic steeped oil. I served alongside cheddar broccoli rice, and grilled rib-eye topped w/ sauteed mushrooms and onions. OUTSTANDING side to complement our dinner. Thank you!!!"
366914,116610,2009-05-15,5,Excellent recipe! Positively delicious! I didn't realize I was to saute the garlic and parsley in the olive oil though... duh.. so I had to go back and add the olive oil after I warmed them. I think next time I will put the asparagus and garlic/parsley oil in a ziplock back to coat I had a little trouble drizzling the oil on. Tasty Tasty side dish! Thank you!
1376400,116610,2009-11-10,4,4.5 stars. The only thing I change was halving the oil. I baked them as stated and the bacon was just right but the asparagus was slightly burnt. I think it's because there's not enough oil to coat the asparagus. So may be reducing oil here is not an option if you want the perfect result.
537872,116610,2009-11-11,5,These are so yummy. I had smaller Asparagus so I cooked the bacon for about 10 minutes first (I used turkey bacon and regular bacon) then I cooked olive oil and garlic in a pan and poured it all in a zip lock bag and tossed together. I wrapped the bacon around 4 pieces of the Asparagus and cooked for 10 minutes it was perfect! Everyone loved it and it had suck a nice presentation.
174090,116610,2009-11-28,5,"These are delicious, great for garlic lovers like me, and make a really nice presentation. The only issue I had was my own fault - I used thick cut bacon, and the bacon wasn't done enough when the asparagus was done. Next time I'll either pre-cook the bacon just a little bit, or I'll use thin cut bacon. Otherwise I made as directed, didn't need to use toothpicks though, just wrapped the bacon around the bundles. Made this for a different Thanksgiving side and it went over really well."
1548400,116610,2010-04-14,5,"Simply delicious!  These are quite easy to make and they are a complete hit!  Perfect as an appetizer or a side dish.  I placed the asparagus at an angle before rolling the bacon up, this way there was maximum coverage and you got bacon with every bite!"
1595175,116610,2010-04-24,5,Delicious and easy to prepare.  I also wrapped the bacon at an angle for more coverage and drizzled with homemade garlic infused olive oil..sprinkled fresh parsley at the end.  Wonderful side dish at dinner and leftovers made a great pannini the next day for lunch.
1139501,116610,2010-05-01,4,"It's four stars not because I didn't like it but because my boyfriend and friend wasn't as fond of it as I was??? I really liked it though, the asparagus was perfect with a tinge of sweetness and the bacon was heavenly. I also wrapped the bacon sideways going up to the tip, great coverage and it looked beautiful I wished I had taken a picture of it but I couldn't wait to sample them!"
220403,116610,2010-10-10,5,"Fantastic!!  I used thin-cut bacon and wrapped it sideways, covering the length of the stalks of asparagus.  I ended up baking it for an additional 10 minutes and it was just perfect!  Tasted great and was a big hit.  This is a great dish for company due to its ease in preparation and its beautiful presentation.  Thanks!"
1271506,116610,2010-11-26,5,"Served this at our small (4 person) Thanksgiving dinner to great acclaim.  Following the lead of many reviewers, I did wrap the bacon at an angle to get almost complete coverage.  It did take quite a bit longer than 20 minutes to brown up, though -- although perhaps that was because we kept opening the oven to see if it was done yet!  Will certainly make again."
10404,116610,2011-12-25,5,"We loved this!  I did add a scant teaspoon of dijon mustard to the olive oil/garlic blend, coating the spears before I wrapped them.  I used hickory smoked bacon that was on the thick side so I baked for 30 minutes, flipping the bundles after 15 minutes.  The perfect side for our Christmas Eve Dinner!"
1636470,116610,2013-05-14,5,"This was the best!! I had half a pound of bacon and a bunch of asparagus in the fridge and this was the perfect way to use it up. I will be making this again - over and over, I wish I used 2 bunches of asparagus and a whole lb of bacon, it was that good! I did not use toothpicks, I just wrapped the bacon around the asparagus and it stayed very well."
1056692,116610,2013-08-21,5,"Wonderful side with dinner tonight. I used turkey bacon and cooked a few minutes less. Everything else was the same. When I make this with real bacon, I will either pre cook the bacon or use thin bacon and cook under the broiler, since at 20 minutes the thinner asparagus we like would have been overcooked. Thanks for sharing. I&#039;ve done this with prosciutto but not regular bacon. Great dish."
1802849661,116610,2014-11-11,4,"This was simple to make and so tasty! Bacon makes everyhing better, but with the garlic oil as well, this was a fantastic appetiser which we will definitely be having again!"

198154,116610,2016-11-10,4,"I added extra garlic to this, as I do with every recipe because we love it. Everything else stayed the same. My bacon needed to cook longer than the stated time. My family would have liked the bacon even more crisp, but the asparagus would have been over done if I left it in any longer."
2001475819,116610,2017-04-07,5,"I love asparagus - my family, not so much. I made this recipe for Easter 2 years ago and there was not a crumb left over. They asked for more. It is now expected on the Easter menu."
2001977073,116610,2018-02-13,5,I've never been a lover of asparagus untill this ! I love it now ! I done it has a starter for friends I got loads of compliments! But I didn't tell em I got from you ! Sorry but thankyou!
2001078095,432463,2016-07-06,5,I made this years ago and it was a great hit. Glad to find the recipe again and will make this weekend.
238364,51896,2006-12-03,5,"Dancer,

this is sooo yummy!!! very tender! I've made some substitutions as I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.

It was my 1st time cooking veal, believe it or not and it's going into my monthly rotation just for myself, husband doesn't eat red meat!

Thanx for the recipe!"
2002263931,298874,2018-09-02,5,Must try! You'll never go buy a packaged or can gravy again!!!! ??????
174096,365951,2011-03-18,5,"Easy and delicious!  Can't go wrong with bacon, onion and cream cheese for the filling!  I LOVED the idea and ease of using a mini muffin tin to hold the mushrooms - it was perfect, and I will definitely be using that tip for all stuffed mushrooms in the future!  Thanks for sharing.  PAC Spring '11"
54539,365951,2011-09-15,5,"Made this for my hubby for his birthday dinner and he loved it. I will be making it again. It's very easy and does not cost that much to make. I didn't use a muffin pan, I just placed them in a 9x13 baking dish and they turned out fine. Also I chopped a little mozz cheese and added it."
2191802,365951,2012-03-03,3,"Nice recipe, but low fat cream cheese tastes a bit pasty when cooked, in my opinion."
1677099,365951,2012-04-22,5,I made a small batch of these tonight.  Yum!  I used regular cream cheese and added a little Parmesan and a pinch of salt.  I just put them on a silpat lined baking pan.
37449,45392,2002-12-11,5,I love rosemary on my potatoes and this recipe is great! I took the foil off the last 10 minutes and stirred them around. Thanks for sharing!
8688,45392,2003-07-18,4,"These were really quite good! I added more salt and pepper to suit our tastes and baked the potatoes around 45-50 minutes till done.  I used baby red potatoes and cut them into quarters.  Love the Rosemary! Thank you, Barb!"
47421,45392,2003-07-21,4,"I used baby reds cut into quarters, used 8 TBS. butter and 4 of oil ---just easier to put the whole stick of butter in :)  ---- and I also added two cloves of crushed garlic.  I cooked them about 40 minutesk, and sprinkled some parmesan over top before serving.  Very good."
51011,45392,2003-07-24,5,These potatoes were great! i took sharon123's advice and left the foil off for the last 10 minutes and also stired them around. They were so tender and tasty!!  I was worried that the oil and the butter would be too much- but it wasnt.  We will be having them again soon!!  Thanks for sharing!
92137,45392,2003-09-01,5,These are delicious and so easy!  Garlic sounds like a nice addition so I will try that next time.  
13483,45392,2003-11-23,3,This just didn't do it for me.  I like crispy oven fried potatoes.  I knew leaving a cover on it would not crisp them so I removed it half way through.  Too late!!  The spuds were steamed and not crisp at all.  I will not cover it at all.  The rosemary was a great addition though.  
26711,45392,2003-12-04,5,"Very delicious recipe.  I made the recipe exactly indicated but added a tablespoon of chopped green onions to the mix before baking, which gave it a hint of onion flavor without taking away from the rosemary.  It was also easy to make and my husband loved it too."
36810,45392,2004-10-21,5,I had a dinner party this weekend - about 20 guests.  Everyone loved this!  I will make this again and again!
148618,45392,2004-10-26,5,This is a great recipe I have made them on several occassions. The last time I made them I sprinkled some parmesan on them and YUM! My whole family loves these. Thanx for a great recipe.
82650,45392,2004-12-21,5,Great recipe.  Easy and everyone loves it.  Thanks!
11461,45392,2005-10-11,5,"I used two pounds of baby red potatoes that I had bought, and the amount of butter and oil was a little too much for them. I just used a slotted spoon to remove them from the pan, and they were absolutely delicious.  I added a little powdered garlic along with the salt and pepper and did not cover them in the oven.  It took a little longer to cook, but it was worth the wait.  Thanks for a new way to think of potatoes!"
28346,45392,2005-11-18,5,"A super side dish!  Made these this past Saturday (11/12) for my future MIL's b-day dinner per request of my fiancé.  I expected I might have leftovers due to some picky eaters, but there wasn't a potato chunk remaining when we were done.  Easy to prepare and definitely easy to eat!  "
137911,45392,2007-09-19,5,Totally delicious!  I loved the subtle flavor of the rosemary.  Really fragrant and perfect with the potatoes.  I served them with our Valentine's dinner celebration along with steak and beets and a salad.  Very easy to make too! ~ Update: 9/19/07...made them tonight with sloppy joes.  Great side dish for many meals.  I added additional season salt after they were done.
583276,45392,2007-10-21,4,"The dish was very good.  I added garlic with the spices and sprinkled with parmesan when it was done.  Only problem was the time was way off.  I did 30 min at 375 and then bumped it up to 425 for the last 10 min with my asparagus, and the potatoes were still not cooked all the way.  Since all my food was done I had to throw them in the mircrowave for 5 min to finish cooking."
729254,45392,2008-12-20,4,"This is a great recipe but I had to cook my potatoes much longer than what was recommended by the recipe. Next time I will try cooking them at 425 instead of 375. I think that 375 may be a bit low for roasting potatoes. The seasoning was very nice, thanks for posting."
444132,369241,2009-09-15,5,"Who knew it was so easy?!?  Wow, mersaydees, this is so delicious, and just takes a food processor and some patience.  I think I let mine go for about 15 minutes until it formed the paste and the oils started to come out. Absolutely delicious and decadent on a slice of whole grain sourdough bread for breakfast!!  Thanks for posting!  Made for PAC Fall 2009."
573325,369241,2010-06-03,5,"WOW, mersaydees, this is such a great gem of a recipe! I love almond butter, but seldmoly have it, cause its soooo expensive where I live. Well, now I can just make it at home and it tastes way better than the store bought, too. Love it!
My only problem with this recipe was that I dont have a food processor, which meant this recipe took ages to prepare and involved a lot of woman power. But it was all worth it in the end! :)
THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this wonderful recipe with us, that will become a staple in my house for sure!
Made and reviewed for the Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap and Veggie Swap #23 June 2010."
496862,369241,2011-02-21,5,This is a good recipe but I did have to add a small amount of grapeseed oil to make this work for me. I processed it in my food processor for about 15 minutes and it did finally get a little smoother but I definitely liked it better with the oil.  All in all a good recipe that I will use many times over to save alot of money!  That alone is enough for a 5-star review. Thanks!
169430,276028,2009-02-20,5,"What a lovely mix of sweet and tart. It was nice and thick then I poured it but it did separate very quickly. Perhaps the ice addition would help that. I didn't add any sweetening as the orange juice was quite sweet on it's own. This would be wonderful made with the ice and poured into a frozen glass in the summer. BTW, I made the full recipe and drank it all, the servings aren't big."
199213,125847,2005-09-19,4,"I added some ground sausage, good."
41578,125847,2006-02-09,5,"We loved this fried rice.  I used 2 cups of rice and, for us, it was a perfect ratio of rice and vegetables.  This is a keeper and I can wait to make it again.  Thanks for sharing, Tornado Ali.
"
704950,254998,2008-11-03,5,"This is really great!!  I love the oranges with balsamic!!  What a super combination!!  These flavors combine so well together!!  The fennel is subtle against the arugula and the whole dish has nice depth of flavor.  I love this one, will definitely make again and again!"
353579,207931,2007-05-23,5,"This was a huge hit at dinner tonight.  I don't often make meals that feature big hunks of meat, but this one turned out great.  I knew it was done when I was able to slice off a piece using a plastic spatula.  I had to add a bit of beef stock for the last 20 minutes or so.  It was done after an hour and a half, but the liquid had dried up and I wanted to leave it in for just a bit longer.  Nice tanginess to the flavor.  Thanks for posting!"
179827,207931,2007-07-05,5,This was very nice and moist.  The flavors were great and infused the meat.  Definitely a keeper. Thanks!
254614,153800,2006-03-09,5,"This  is the greatest tomato soup ever. Make sure you chop the onions very fine. If you reheat, make sure it is on half power in microwave because you don't want the cream to curdle. "
124249,153800,2006-04-05,5,"I can see why your family craves this soup. It is delicious. It is also easy to prepare. Tasted just as good the second day. 

Thanks Krsi Sue.

Bullwinkle"
324390,153800,2007-09-17,5,"Easy, easy, easy, and oh so good! This is a real family pleaser. I served it with some sandwiches and felt like I was spoiling myself! Next time I might try it with some non-fat half and half to save on some calories - but I'm not sure I want to mess with a good thing. It made about 5 servings. Made for PAC 2007."
137081,153800,2007-09-19,5,Thank you so much for this recipe! I moved to Montana almost two years ago and six months ago they shut down all of the 4B's restaurants. My family raves about this recipe and is so excited when I make it. Thanks for the comfort food!!!
373178,153800,2007-12-10,5,I loved this recipe!! The only thing I change is I use veggie broth instead of chicken. I also like using my hand blender at the end to make it extra creamy. Thank you!!
703233,153800,2007-12-25,5,"Growing up in Montana, we always stopped at 4B's in Miles City for their tomato soup.  This is a great recipe - we made it for our Christmas Eve dinner.  What a hit!  Thank you so much!!"
1175134,153800,2009-02-18,5,"Born and raised in Montana, I recently moved away, and this is the best homesick cure I have found!  Thank You!  Taste just like it's supposed to.  Perfect."
808027,153800,2009-04-12,3,"Too sweet for us.  Didn't really care for this one, thanks."
114716,153800,2009-07-26,0,"This is the ORIGINAL recipe, I just loveeeee it.  My son came home with their new recipe using chicken base, cream and coffee mate, it doesn't curddle as easy with the coffee mate."
225096,153800,2010-02-26,0,"This is exactly what I was looking for!  On the menu for the weekend and I like the addition of the baking soda which I had a little old Italian lady tell me helps cut the acidity of the tomatoes and ""sweetens"" the dish a bit."
384657,153800,2010-02-26,5,"We really liked this.  I used fat free half and half instead of the cream to make it a tad healthier and it still tasted great.  Oh, and I also put it through the blender at the end, so my toddlers would eat it.  :) Thanks for posting."
696196,153800,2010-11-23,5,How I've missed 4B's cream of tomato - the ULTIMATE in comfort food.  Thank you so much for posting this!
294000,153800,2011-01-20,4,"This is an excellent and easy soup to make. I would probably cut sugar in half next time or even omit as it was a little sweet for my taste. I didn't simmer very long as I was in a hurry. Used fat free half and half in place of cream and warmed it in microwave instead of double boiler (again, in a hurry). I used a hand blender on the tomatoes before adding the half and half. Also added some basil and pepper and a little salt. My family, including a 2-year-old, devoured it. Thanks!"
1827731,153800,2011-02-13,5,"Simple and delicious, even with the healthier modifications suggested by other commenters. Deviating from the recipe I threw in some coriander at the end - if you enjoy coriander (I know its contentious), it goes VERY well in this soup."
1732980,153800,2011-04-23,0,"This is the same recipe I used to have that I got from 4B's years ago, but I lost mine. I am very thankful to have it again. Thanks so much. I really miss 4B's Restaurants and this soup."
714468,153800,2011-05-10,4,"I loved this soup, but my husband likes Campbell's tomato soup better.  I used my immersion blender to get it really creamy.  I added in a bit of salt and pepper and next time I make it I think I'll try basil as well.  This was super easy so I'll definitely make again and halve the recipe for just myself and my daughter.  Maybe it was because I simmered it a little longer, but I got more like 4 or 5 servings, not 8."
598608,153800,2011-08-03,5,Wonderful soup and I don't like tomato soup!  I blended the soup b4 adding cream as I like I smooth not chunky. I think I may reduce the sugar next time or maybe try it one time with splendor as hubby's is diabetic.
168462,153800,2011-08-05,5,Oh my this is good and so easy to make. I did add an extra Knorr chicken cube and I used homemade rice milk in place of the cream. My daughter who is a vegetarian loved this soup and asked me if I would make it again tomorrow. I followed another reviewers advice and pureed the soup. It was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.
789516,153800,2011-11-10,5,Loved the simplicity of the ingredients.  It was really good!
1683306,153800,2012-03-02,0,This is an excellent soup!!!!! I also pureed the tomatoes before adding the cream as well as adding a bag of spinach with large stems removed (simmer until tender) and 8oz of feta cheese....was absolutely amazing.
111306,153800,2012-04-16,1,Not sure where I went wrong :( Followed direction and it curdled both times I made it.
326176,153800,2017-01-01,5,now that most of the 4B's have closed near us I make this all the time. sometimes I make it with everything but the cream and can it as a soup concentrate. then I can just add the cream later when we're ready to eat it. I usually just leave the sugar out but that's to my taste.
2001955966,153800,2018-01-27,0,We have 4bs back in missoula. Your recipe is close but your missing an ingredient. Regarding It curdling we cook ours at 4bs in a double boiler set up.
136997,217445,2007-10-08,5,Excellent dip. It disappeared in a flash! :)
37305,155531,2006-02-24,4,"These got mixed reviews.  I thought they were ok but my husband thought they were awesome.  These are different...not a typical muffin texture.  The batter looked more like cookie dough than batter...I was worried until they came out of the oven! I filled my muffin cups almost to the top and these didn't rise at all.  I checked my baking soda and it's fine, so I guess these just don't rise that much.  I will make these again for my husband.  Thanks for posting! "
383346,155531,2007-12-16,5,Yummy!  I did half the recipe and reduced a little bit with the sugar.    These muffins are so tasty.  Thanks Kim :)  Made for 123 hit wonders.
143721,155531,2007-12-24,5,"Great muffin.  I used to types of apple, Granny Smith and a Gala.  Great taste and texture.  I may try these again using walnuts.  Thanks for a great recipe and congrats with the football pool win."
599450,155531,2008-05-03,5,"These are definitely a different kind of muffin. My husband said they were the best muffins he's ever had -- quite a compliment coming from him! These didn't rise, but they were so moist, yet crumbly, and rich, that didn't seem to matter. Made with Gala apples. These are serve at the B&B muffins! Thanks, Kim127! Made for Please Review My Recipe tag."
557801,155531,2008-09-14,5,"Yum!  I made these as written, except I cut back on the sugar a bit, and I think I could've cut back more.  The other change I made was with the pecans.  I thought it might look nice to chop them finely, and sprinkle them on top with a little cinnamon and sugar.  They are SO good.  When I opened the oven to check them, it smelled like those toasted pecans and almonds you get at the fair.  mmmmmmmm.  As others have mentioned, they are somewhat crumbly, with a different texture than most muffins, so I think they work best with muffin papers, as opposed to just greasing the muffin tin.  The paper holds them together nicely.  Thanks for posting.  Made for PRMR."
169430,155531,2008-10-05,5,"Wonderful Fall muffins. I made 12 and that ask for a cup of sugar, I used a 1/2 cup of Splenda and that was right on the money. It also ask for 3/4 cup of oil, I used 1.4 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. That cut back on the fat and was a grand addition to the muffin flavor. I used twice of amount of pecans just because I love them. I got a pic of the 10 remaining muffins after we sampled while I still could,lol. These will not be around long!"
41984,155531,2017-07-04,3,"I made these as written. I think that there was way too much oil in the recipe. By the time I went to get the second batch ready for the oven, the oil had pooled around the remaining batter. The paper liners from the first batch are all greasy. When I tested the first batch, the toothpick came out clean. I just tasted one. Although the flavor is good, the muffin didn't taste like it was done. I was hoping that to take these to a brunch today but these are too iffy for me to give out. :("
2001442405,171156,2017-03-18,5,I haven't cook it yet. But I will it looks good to eat.
6258,16451,2003-05-16,5,"Bergy, thanks for posting a great tasting recipe.  I made the recipe as you directed, and then I added 1 green onion, just for another layer of flavor.  Really, you could play around with different flavors for these mushrooms, like using a chipotle instead of a jalapeño.  This is definately a keeper.  Thanks! 
:-)  "
75497,16451,2005-08-24,5,"These were delicious!  I wasn't sure how broiled cottage cheese would taste, but, it turned out to just be a creamy background to the jalapeno.  I used Miss Annie's suggestion and added some chopped green onion, also.  I'll definitely be making these again, especially since they're only 1.1 WW point per serving.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
289357,16451,2007-09-30,4,"These were really good, but no matter how long I seemed to cook them they never really browned on top (the cheese just got a littly runny).  No matter - they were wonderful!  I added a lot more jalepeno and garlic, and they were still great.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!"
600643,16451,2007-10-02,4,"They were way too spicy for my family and me, so next time I'll use just one clove of garlic and maybe 1/3 cup of cottage cheese, but they were otherwise fantastic!"
46660,16451,2007-10-11,3,"I wasn't really 'over the moon' for these.  I mean, I liked them enough, but they definitely tasted ""lowfat.""  I think I would toy with the filling if I were to make them again, keeping them lowfat, but replacing the cottage cheese with something else."
174096,215517,2009-11-23,5,"Quick and easy to put together, with a great taste.  Thanks for sharing!"
179133,215517,2009-11-27,5,"This is very good! I found the oil to overpower the other flavors a bit so added just a little more cheese to combat that and it was perfect. Would also be good with some herbs & spices added (garlic, oregano, basil, etc.) Thanks for posting!"
791416,290047,2008-06-08,4,Hmm. Not bad. I didnt mind the oaty texture.
58762,401,2009-03-01,3,"This was ok.  We thought it had too much whip cream though.

Also, you may want to update the recipe with servings and freezing time. =)"
1634,11427,2001-09-17,5,"This is a great "" Starter recipe "", using Parmesan Cheese as a base, that allows creative cooks to experiment a little each time until it is just right for them."
4470,11427,2001-10-01,0,Another variation is with a bit of butter and a tbsp of curry powder
23333,11427,2002-04-07,5,"All I can say is WOW!!  Bergy, made two batches - regular recipe and one using your sugestion of curry powder - amazing!!  DH and I love popcorn, so this was a very big hit in our home!!  I added a bit more parmesan cheese - love it!  I think next time I may try a batch with garlic powder - give it yet another flavour!  Yummy!  A definite keeper!!"
49360,11427,2002-08-06,5,"I agree with Bill, this is a great starter recipe with endless possibilities. I doubled the Parmesan cheese and added probably 2 pinches of cumin. Wonderful Bergy. My family eats popcorn at least 2 times/week. I will try the curry idea next. Thanks so much."
37636,11427,2004-08-31,5,"Great snack! I like this pocorn just as it is! I think the hint of thyme is wonderful! I did make this using 1 bag of microwave popcorn and cut back on the salt and butter just a bit, so it is possible there was less popcorn (I am not exactly sure if the popcorn in the bag was 1 cup or not), but I found the spicing to be just right. Thanks for posting- it was really good!"
56181,11427,2004-09-03,5,"Very good!  I made a few small changes, those were that I left out the salt (not supposed to have much) and used spray butter intead of melted (0 calories). I also must admit that I used canned parmesan cheese and it worked just fine.  I used recipe # 71499 to pop the corn.  Thanks for sharing, Bergy!"
131126,11427,2004-10-01,5, I love spicy snacks and this is terrific. I will make this often. Thanks Bergy!!
158086,11427,2004-10-11,5,Made this for our euchre party and it was a big hit...the only problem i had was i made it a day ahead of time and it got soggy...but still tasted yummy
33159,11427,2004-11-21,5,"This recipe has been calling my name since I added it to my cookbook!  And, I really wanted to make it last night even though I didn't have any parmesan.  So, I did.  And, it was FANTASTIC!!  I didn't think there would be enough seasoning for that much popcorn but it really does go a long way.  I enjoyed this recipe A LOT!  (The only negative thing about this recipe is that my dogs usually get tossed a couple of kernels when we're snacking on 'corn.  But this was too spicy to give them any!)  I can't wait to try this recipe next time with the cheese!"
68960,11427,2006-01-05,5,"Bergy, this is extremely yummy! Santa bought our family a popcorn maker for Christmas and your recipe has been voted a family favourite.  Thank you so much for posting!"
173314,11427,2006-01-10,5,"Love it! to save on calories (which I know we dont want to talk about)  I sometimes spray popcorn with ""I cant believe its not butter spray"" and then add seasonings!"
288704,11427,2006-02-05,5,"I dont usually like eating popcorn. My husband made this recipe today (as his snack to watch the superbowl) and now I am totally addicted, and I cant stop eating it. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe with us."
284922,11427,2006-02-28,5,What a nice change from the ordianry johnny salt!  The combo of spices blended wonderfully.  Thank you so much posting this! :)
68884,11427,2006-03-11,4,"Very tasty. The cayenne gives it a nice kick, and I've always been a fan of parmesan & popcorn. This is just a bit too much butter for me, so I'll tone that down next time. I added garlic powder instead of thyme. :)"
310156,11427,2006-04-27,5,I love popcorn!  This sent me over the top...YUM!  My husband and I will be having this with our movies from now on.
366487,11427,2008-10-17,4,My DH bought an air popper(for caramel corn)...so we've been trying some different recipes.  This was one of our fav's. I baked the leftovers on a cookie sheet at 200 degrees for an hour to crisp it up. Mmm...so good. Will make often this winter. Thanks!
53368,11427,2006-05-17,5,"Yummy! My husband and I were in a snacky mood tonight, so I told him I'd whip up some adult popcorn. I actually made a mistake because what I ment to make was recipe #14680, Peanut Butter Popcorn, and for some reason thought THAT was called 'Adult Popcorn'.  Anyway, I made this instead and LOVED it!  It's got a nice bite too it and great flavor than just regular buttered popcorn.  Thanks for sharing this one! It'll go in my 'How to Spice Up Popcorn' recipe section. :)"
147027,11427,2006-05-21,5,"Sesationally addictive, we both just loved this and devoured it in record time! This will certainly get made again and again. For any cooks in Australia eyeing this off, I used a standard 100gm butter popcorn pack and halved everything. Thanks for posting Bergy!"
332843,11427,2006-09-06,5,"I made this for DH about 2 weeks ago--after trying it, he has singlehandedly consumed at least one bag of microwave popcorn PER NIGHT...  We micro-pop the popcorn, shake the closed bag, open & dump the seasoning, then reclose & shake again.  We always omit the butter because the microwave stuff we have is oily enough for seasonings to stick without it.  Blaming you for weight-gain, Bergy! :)  WhoKnew"
134550,11427,2006-09-07,5,WARNING: This popcorn has been known to cause a normally generous mom to turn into a greedy glutton. It also puts snacker at risk of addiction. Please snack at your own risk.
381469,11427,2006-11-11,4,Delicious!  What a fast/simple recipe to make.  Our 4 year old loved it (whew!)!  2-thumbs up!
375186,11427,2006-11-21,5,Very nice!
225896,11427,2006-12-23,4,"Yum Yum! I left out the Cumin and thyme, added a bit of Johnny's Seasoning (my old stand-by). Delicious, couldn't stop eating it! The Cayenne gave it a nice little kick."
380723,11427,2007-02-16,3,Made as described ok flavour but not sure about the parmesan it was a bit strange.
11176,11427,2007-03-16,5,"What a lovely, pleasant surprise! I'd put parmesan on popcorn before and wasn't that impressed, but making this recipe as indicated, coupled with the fact that I used a really good quality parmesan (no more of that canned stuff from Kraft!) gave us OUTSTANDING results!  For the first time I finished my half of the popcorn last night and wanted more. Thank you, Bergy, for a delicious keeper!"
126104,11427,2007-03-25,5,"""Adult"" is right!!! I think I added a little too much cayenne, and BRING ON THE WATER FOLKS. This will be perfect with margaritas or beer (including the extra cayenne!!!) I didn't have ""real"" cheese, and used the stuff in the green box.  Bergy, this is absolutely delicious."
362368,11427,2007-08-21,5,its good with microwave popcorn me (13) and my ten yearpld bro loved it. not spicy
576675,11427,2007-09-06,4,It was really good I loved it!!
278516,11427,2007-10-15,4,"Halved the recipe, as it was just for the 2 of us.
Really nice."
621689,11427,2007-11-09,5,This was very easy to make and delicioso! I used fresh parmesan cheese and it grated up just fine. Very addicting as mentioned before. Thank you!
331557,11427,2007-11-18,5,This was really good and super easy to make - not to mention cheaper than buying the premade spices from Kernels.  Thanks for sharing!
324621,11427,2007-11-20,4,"Nice little ""something different"" on our popcorn this evening. Thanks!"
125773,11427,2008-01-20,4,"This is Yummy, 5+
Thanks for sharing"
460854,11427,2008-02-02,5,"Nice change from the usual buttered popcorn.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand, so I just put in a pinch of freshly cracked black pepper.  As Rachael Ray would say: YUM-O!"
534623,11427,2008-02-10,5,"I love adding different spices to popcorn, and this was no exception. This combination works out great, and the Parmesan cheese is especially yummy. Thanks for sharing!"
85322,11427,2008-04-15,5,I was looking for ideas to spice up popcorn and this was extremely good.  However I left out the thyme and substituted corriander instead.  This makes a LOT of popcorn.  I ended up feeding half of it to the neighbor's dogs the next day.  They loved it by the way.  I also think that you could use a bit more melted butter as the parmesan didn't seem to want to totally stick and some ended up in the bottom of the bowl.
815198,11427,2008-05-13,5,This is the best popcorn recipe ever!! It literally is addicting. Whenever my husband and I make popcorn this is the only way I want to make it now!! Love it...thanks for sharing!!
346860,11427,2008-06-05,5,"DELICIOUS!!! I popped three bags of microwavable popcorn rather than doing it on the stove top- I go for the easy way when it comes to popcorn. ;0) I tossed it all in a paper grocery bag and added all the goodies on top- I shook it like crazy and dumped it in a huge bowl. Sooooo delish- and easy! Great party snack food! Thanks so much for sharing, Bergy! Love it!"
209447,11427,2008-07-27,5,The first time I made this I made it twice. the second time I made it I made it three times. I am starting to think that my hubby's friends want to have poker here because they now they will get this popcorn. So good and it literally takes 5 min to make.
353579,11427,2008-08-03,5,"Yum!  I didn't really do a lot of measuring for this - just popped a bunch of popcorn (microwave - with butter and salt already added) and sprinkled on the parmesan, cumin, thyme and cayenne.  Really good mix - thanks for posting!"
427184,11427,2008-09-28,5,Very good!
483454,11427,2008-11-02,5,"Yum!  We had movie night on Friday night and fancied something nibbly to go along with our movies, and this was just fantastic.  So easy to make, and ingredients that I've always got on hand.  I only made half the recipe for the two of us, but we could quite easily have eaten more.  No changes apart from that.

Thanks, Bergy, this will be a regular for our movie nights, that's for sure!"
252636,11427,2008-11-19,5,This was great!  Super easy and was the perfect snack.  We made it for game night and we couldn't get enough.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!
188119,11427,2009-02-26,5,"great! very easy, and I added some more cumin and cayenne pepper.  Thanks"
450004,11427,2009-04-20,5,"This was fantastic!  We made it last night to nibble on while watching a movie, and it was a hit!  I had no parmesan so i had to leave that out.  i didn't measure the spices, just kept adding til it tasted right (we made it hot and spicy!)  I also added a little garlic powder.  A great recipe!"
844554,11427,2009-08-04,5,Great tasting! Gave the popcorn a different taste for sure. Thanks for the recipe.
74904,11427,2010-02-27,1,Did not care for this flavor.
227748,11427,2010-05-22,5,tweaked it a little for personal preference used no cumin and added rosemary-  fantastic-  thanks for posting!
140132,11427,2013-10-18,4,I made this for our game day party.  DH really liked the flavor on it.  It had that lingering heat.  So good.  Thank you for sharing.
1072593,434069,2010-10-07,5,"Normally I use the tantrum technique to get DH to do things around the house. Not exactly the most romantic approach, but effective.  Today I changed tactics and made this offering.  Let's say...we've worked it out."
226066,193325,2007-02-10,5,I love cheesecake but usually make a chocolate or fruit based cheesecake.  Your cake was a nice change for us!  It is light and very tasty.  I used low-fat cream cheese and low-fat sour cream and made the crust with recipe #96877.  I also used lemon extract instead of vanilla and it came out great!  Thanks Recipe Reader for making me rediscover the taste of a basic cream cheese pie!!
220153,193325,2007-04-02,4,"I liked the simplicity of this recipe. I used low-fat cream cheese and light sour cream. I also used 1/4 cup Splenda instead of the sugar. The crust was a chocolate store-bought one. I also melted 1/4 cup of semi-sweet choc chips, added about 1/2 cup of the cream cheese mixture to it and stirred. I then poured the vanilla mixture in the crust, topped it with the chocolate mixture and baked. My only complaint is that the filling was a bit sour. I think it needs more sugar/splenda."
636721,193325,2008-12-17,4,This recipe is so close to the one I lost.. so am going to give it a try.. the one I lost was from a package of low fat cream cheese from Publix grocery store.. thanks for posting this.. I have been looking for awhile to find one even close to the one I had..
2149726,193325,2012-01-25,5,"I enjoyed this recipe. The first time it came out a little too sweet for my husband, but the kids loved it. The second time I added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and it turned out perfect, you could taste the lemon, but it wasn't too overwhelming."
2023776,193325,2012-09-26,5,Made it with mashed Strawberries and White chocolate shavings.It was delicious.A great basic Cheese Pie recipe.
169430,289665,2013-03-26,5,"This made an excellent brunch today. All of the wanted flavors and textures are here. Our son is coming to visit over Easter and I&#039;ll make sure that he has this while he&#039;s here. He&#039;ll love it too. Made for Pic A Chef, Spring 2013"
921940,194303,2009-01-30,5,"I cut back on the sugar about 1/4 cup and added 1 Tbsp cinnamon.  These were great.  I would bake them only 45 minutes, though, they were a little close to being overdone.  That could be my oven, though.  Thank you!"
107583,492759,2013-04-12,5,Excellent white sauce.  The oregano and garlic really are a nice addition.  I used this on a grilled chicken breast marinated in your recipe #492760.  Made for Spring 2013 PAC.
27643,6814,2002-05-27,4,"Very good. I left out the olives. Sauted the shallots in the oil, added the salt, parsley, and a T shredded parmesan. Great asparagus!"
87024,6814,2004-02-03,5,"I used 2T olive oil, sauteed the shallots  in it, and added a little more salt.  Very good."
4470,6814,2004-02-13,4,"Easy - nice results. The recipe does not clarify if you put raw shallots on theasparagus or if you saute them - I sauted them. I used Walnut oil instead of peanut oil - nice result. Watch you don't overcook the asparagus, try them crunchy you Thanks Zaar for a good recipe 
"
101083,6814,2005-04-28,4,I steamed the asparagus instead of boiling - I like the results much better.  I too sautéed the shallots with a bit of finely diced garlic in olive oil - squeezed a lemon slice over the asparagus then added the shallots on top.  Very tasty
377581,6814,2007-10-23,5,This was very good. Thank you for posting!
499050,6814,2008-09-28,4,Very Good!
242729,15211,2007-04-11,5,"A French classic which I often make - this recipe was absolutley perfect, with suberb instructions and serving tips - thanks Derf, for reminding me to make this great potato dish again! I changed nothing - I have a slightly different recipe, so I wanted to see how this worked - it was flawless....classic dishes need no gilding, and this is a good example. Thanks Derf.FT:-)
(My camera is packed ready for my trip to the UK - sorry.....next time!)"
570804,15211,2007-10-16,5,Thanks for reminding me of this classic potato dish.  Have made it in the past but it has been overlooked.   Simple and elegant. Needs nothing else added.  Your method is excellent.  Thanks Derf.
107583,458729,2013-05-08,5,Simple and tasty.  Loved the lemon and chives-nice and light.
424680,188466,2008-11-01,5,"Made this for a group this evening, & already (before they get here) I'm managed to eat about 1/4 of it! OUTSTANDING TASTE & so easy to prepare! I did use toasted almonds! Thanks for a keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed for My-3-Chefs]"
342165,286851,2008-02-19,0,"I havent made this, wondering why there is no nutrition info?"
791948,286851,2008-06-26,5,"I loved your story! That was a five star story! I decided to make it just for fun and it was really good. Reminded me of the stories my Grandmother used to tell me when I was younger.

Thanks so much
Who needs the nutritional info on these simple ingredients??? Just make it."
1022160,329490,2008-11-11,5,"I absolutely hated brussle sprouts until I tried this recipe.  We liked the grilled fruit as well.  We made it once with apples, and the second time with Japanese apple-pears.  Both ways were delicious.  Thank you!"
6357,60893,2003-04-25,5,This is a lovely cake. I've made it before and we all enjoy it.
91392,60893,2005-07-17,4,"Fast, easy.  I didn't have the nuts, and halved the sugar and it came out still plenty sweet.  A pretty cake that rose well in the pan, needs to be refrigerated in the heat."
278639,60893,2008-10-22,5,"This cake tastes really good, but was not a light fluffy cake.  It is dense and moist.  Really easy.  I cut the sugar as suggested by another reviewer, and it was sweet enough, but I think I will top it with a glaze for appearance.  Marie, thanks for the easy tasty recipe!"
2730719,60893,2013-03-10,0,I halved the sugar and also added 1/2 cup of milk to bind it together as the mixture was very dry ... went down well!
101823,41018,2003-11-23,3,"I had wanted to make another bacon wrapped appetizer, but didn't have the proper ingredients.  Therefore, I put these together yesterday afternoon.  I wasn't sure if they were to be served warm or cold.  The flavor didn't differ much with temperature.  I love bacon and the butter flavor of Club crackers.  However, these just weren't outstanding.  My husband liked them cold with a smear of a cream cheese and onion spread."
59879,41018,2007-07-25,5,A recipe that's been around a while. My friend's dh at the whole pan and made himself sick! Quick and easy appetizer to throw together in a snap!   Did not take 2 hours in the oven!
208755,41018,2008-01-01,3,"I love bacon, and I love Club crackers, and I was certain that I would love these, but I just didn't. They were overly heavy with the bacon grease seeping into the cracker. I did add some Parmesan cheese on the crackers before wrapping (since I saw a similar recipe with that addition), and I liked the flavor it added. I also put these on a rack on top of the cookie sheet with the thought that the grease would drain off, but again, there was almost no drainage since the grease stayed in the cracker. I know that lots of folks do like this recipe, even if it wasn't quite my favorite, so I am glad you shared it."
898104,41018,2008-07-21,4,I had this at a progressive dinner.  It was wonderful!!
178427,358155,2009-03-03,5,"Made this today for tonights dessert. Did just like it was written. Loved the simplicity and the fact I could use up some bananas out of the freezer without making banana bread for a change. Mine was done in 35 minutes. Thanks for posting this, WyomingMoonDust."
186979,358155,2010-04-03,5,I was also looking for a recipe besides banana bread to make. I had a new Nordicware pan to try out so this was a perfect marriage. Very light and delightful tasting; enjoyed the richness of the sour cream in the recipe. Cakes turned out perfectly and were served for a pre-Easter brunch. I covered them with the thinnest layer of glaze from your powdered sugar and orange juice without the butter. Delicious! Made for Spring PAC 2010.
282673,137593,2011-01-23,5,"oh this was good! i served it as an appie at my burns night supper. i used a nice sharp tobermory cheddar, and quartered the toasts after broiling. the topping is thick enough that it made great finger food. everyone loved it!"
128473,456715,2011-06-09,5,"I really enjoyed this adult coffee LIG.  Creamy, smooth and a little boozy.  All the flavors blended well together and the ice cream was the icing on top for me.  I used some irish cream whisky and coffee liqueur, so good with the espresso.  Thanks for sharing your treat.  Made for ZWT7 for Witchin Kitchen"
804550,456715,2012-02-21,5,"Delicious! Although this Winter has been quite abnormally warm, there have been some raw nasty nights where this drink really warmed me up. I used the coffee liqueur and it was perfect!<br/>Made for Veg 'N Swap tag 2-2012."
107135,456715,2014-08-22,5,"whats not to like coffee ice cream and kaluha ? nothing this drink rocks  i used chocolate chip ice cream good stuff , hope you are having fun  cakepops on parade  s/a quest"
486725,456715,2017-09-24,5,"We love ourselves an affogato, and this was a yummy spin. I tried to incorporate all the flavors by using dulce de leche gelato and Kahlua. They went well together. I would halve the Kahlua next time."
92385,109944,2005-02-15,4,"Tasty and attractive; nice change from the regular, and hardly any more work either. Thanks for posting!"
52448,109944,2005-03-15,5,Delicious! The bacon and chives gave it a nice crunch and lovely flavour and made it look attractive. Thanks! 
50969,109944,2005-06-12,4,"these potatoes were just so good.i didn't have the chives,and i added just a little margarine to them. this was a very nice change from regular potatoes.this will be made often at our home.thank you."
171084,109944,2006-04-26,5,This was great!  Hubby loved the fresh chives and cheese. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!
227652,109944,2007-06-21,4,"Made this for my hubby tonite. I couldn't believe how creamy the texture was! I only used 1 large potato and used dried chives (all I had). I also used fat free mayo, reduced fat cheese & turkey bacon. Hubby ate a good portion so I'm certainly going to make them again! Was super easy; too!"
578659,109944,2008-03-20,5,"These mashed potatoes are soo good. My husband, who doesn't usually like mashed potatoes that much but loves bacon, really enjoyed this recipe. Thanks so much!"
277825,109944,2008-03-22,4,"These are delicious.  Creamy, tasty.  I didn't have use bacon as it looked all fat at the shop but instead used chopped honey ham, lightly seared in a teaspoon of marg, and skipped the chives because we had none, and son would have whinged about the green bits!  These were very tasty and made a great change to normal old mash.  Tks KC!"
1271673,109944,2009-05-18,4,"It was delicious, but I used lite sour cream and a tiny bit of miracle whip instead of mayo to make it less calories, and I don't like mayonnaise too much. I also used a clove of garlic and some chopped white onion that I let sautee before I put the potatoes and milk and such. I didn't skin the potatos either.... I like skin in potatos...."
1802849661,109944,2015-05-16,5,"This was so delicious! I love bacon and cheese together and with creamy mashed potatoes, this has become a favourite here! Will definitely make it again!"
1436160,109944,2016-02-05,5,Love these mashed potatoes and they are so attractive as well.  Thought the proportions were spot on.  I&#039;ve never used mayonnaise in mashed potatoes before. I used less than called for because I got tired of trying to coax the mayo out of the dreaded plastic squeeze bottle. Thanks for sharing.
2000758368,109944,2017-04-07,4,Really adds to the taste of mashed potatoes and it's easy too.
59064,291086,2008-04-09,5,"I used palm sugar for the sugar and found I didnt
t have enough milk so made this an avocado lassi using a couple of big tablespoons of yoghurt with water. So not quite like the original but this is a great idea."
382280,291086,2011-02-02,5,I just loved this! Thank you for posting.
382631,291086,2012-02-16,5,"yum! this was such a fast and easy breakfast smoothie.It was creamy fresh and sweet,thanks for a new way to use avocado as I love them and always have them in my house:)"
1193707,291086,2012-08-20,5,"This was my brother's favorite when we were young and I still lived in Brazil.  Only he would put a bit more milk and TONS of sugar.  My ex mother in law used to make a wonderful avocado cake, but I unfortunaly don't have the recipe.  I had never tried avocado salted before I moved to the US!"
1802486378,291086,2014-02-13,5,yummyyyy!!! I love this so much. thanks for the recipe. I added few blueberries and nonfat milk to this. taste so great.
205983,97525,2005-06-15,5,"This was an awsome taste.  I didn't have the balsamic vinegar, but I used the balsamic vinegrette dressing. and it worked and tasted great."
173579,97525,2006-03-30,3,"Sorry, We just didn't care for the taste of the balsamic.  Thanks for posting."
410166,97525,2007-09-09,5,Just made these today and tehy are great! We used pork chops and prepared just as written.
122418,97525,2007-10-29,5,I have used this recipe on both beef and pork and my husband loved it.  It's our new favorite marinade. Thanks for sharing!!!!
206354,97525,2008-04-02,5,I use this marinade all the time for both beef and pork.  It works great with brisket!  Also makes any cheap cut tender and taste like it's expensive.
355637,97525,2009-01-05,3,Made on beef... may try pork next time.
1654878,97525,2010-07-19,4,"Tried this for the first time tonight with pork chops and the whole family loved it.  Easy to make and perfect for the grill.  Only suggestion, add a little more salt."
2165137,97525,2012-01-29,5,I used this on grilled pork kabobs and it was a big hit!  We will use this again.
2001383968,97525,2017-02-08,0,If your using pork I would suggest not pouring the marinade all over and probably not basting the skin part otherwise you might have issues with getting the skin nice and crispy.
137302,508378,2014-05-23,3,"There are two major problems with this recipe that I didn&#039;t discover until I had prepared the majority of the ingredients.  The size of the baking vessel is not given and there is no temperature posted.  This definitely caused me problems.  After discovering that a 9 x 12 pan was too big, I switched to a 10 x 7 glass baking dish.  Because I had to guess on the oven temperature I baked at 350 degrees.  After 40 minutes it was definitely not done since not even the sugars were melted.  I baked for 15 min more.  Still not done.  I baked again for another 15 min and then in desperation removed it from the oven.  It tasted okay but was quite dry and not moist at all.  (most likely from the long bake)  It didn&#039;t burn however.  I think if I were to make it again the posting chef would definitely have to change the recipe to reflect the lacking information.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
69838,64841,2003-07-05,5,"OH YUM! We just loved this bread. I made homemade chicken and dumpling soup the other day, and dad was saying he wanted to pick up a loaf of fresh bread to have with it. I had to use cuban bread, as thats what we had, but its not ""toooooooo"" much different :-) It was absolutely wonderful with the soup! Thanks so much for this recipe. I will use it often with dishes that it will go well with :-)"
1356223,64841,2009-10-09,5,"This was totally yummy!  Pressed for time, I decided to broil in the oven instead of baking - turned out great.  If broiling, I'd suggest to sprinkle extra parmesan cheese on the top of each piece of bread!"
31695,29842,2002-08-26,5,"Wow...this was really great!!!  Only change I made, was to add a little onion powder.  To cut the time, I used an 8 oz. bag of cole slaw blend.  Was sweet with just the right amount of tang...thanks for the great recipe!!"
60992,29842,2005-03-25,4,"I took Denise's advise and added some grated onion to the mixture. It was a little too sweet and too mustardy to taste like Marzettis to me. I think next time I will cut back on the sugar and mustard. But Dh ate two big bowls full, so he enjoyed it!
"
137911,29842,2007-08-29,5,"Very good and very close to the real thing.  I had a bag of slaw and wanted to make the traditional slaw, but had no Marzetti's.  I liked this as I can make it healthier than the real thing using lowfat mao and splenda.  It's also cheaper to make it yourself!  Thanks for posting."
86072,29842,2007-08-30,5,"Fixed this for supper this evening and we all loved it!! DH told me to add this to my ""keeper list"". When he suggests that, I know I've got a winner! The only thing I will do differently is to add more celery seed!"
347154,29842,2007-10-29,5,"This has to be the tastiest slaw dressing I've found in over 30 years!  My hubby and I, our famiies and friends are simply wild about it.  I've been asked many times for this ""secret recipe"" and I gladly pass it along - it's too good not to share! 

This recipe is easy and goof-proof.  Although I use ""regular"" mayo and celery seed I never have leftovers even when I double the recipe!  

Kudos to ThatBobbieGirl!"
678604,29842,2007-12-06,5,"Marzetti's is my ""one and only"" slaw dressing - and I always forget it at the store.  This one is plenty close, and definitely delicious!"
468398,29842,2008-02-12,5,Very very good...I am was never a big fan of cole slaw but this turned out awesome...guests loved it and now I am a big fan of cole slaw!! Great with BBQ:)
765301,29842,2008-02-15,5,This stuff is awsome.No more store bought for me .Remianed me of my grandma's cole slaw dressing. thanks.
282215,29842,2008-02-19,5,"Forgot my slaw dressing at the store tonight, so did a quick search for a substitute and SO glad I happened across your recipe! SO easy and SO delicious! I'll probably never purchase slaw dressing again! THANK YOU!!! :)"
3288,29842,2008-03-24,4,"Reminded me a bit of grandma's slaw dressing, which was what we were going for.  Very easy to put together, maybe a little lighter on the mustard for us but overall a good recipe.  Thanks!"
497077,29842,2008-06-03,5,"DH and I loved this dressing! Fast, easy, and yummy! I only used 1-2 tsp. of sugar and that was plenty for us. Thank you for a great recipe!!! Update: For something different, I added chopped apples to the cabbage and carrots and I loved the sweetness the apples gave the slaw."
296556,29842,2008-07-22,5,"AWESOME AND EASY!!! I added a splash of extra vinegar and celery seed as others suggested. I made this dressing with broccoli slaw, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds."
125388,29842,2008-12-29,5,A very good slaw dressing that I added to a bagged slaw mix.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  I made a half recipe to use with a 16 ounce bag of slaw mix.
164182,29842,2009-01-26,5,Awesome.  I added a little celery salt.
29404,29842,2009-02-06,5,"Very very good.  I like a sweet dressing and this fit the bill.  I had to make a few changes, halved the recipe for the two of us.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip.  I also used celery seeds 'cause we watch our salt.  And by not having the salt added to the cabbage, less water drawn out.  Or so it seems to me.  I too used bag-o-slaw mix for convenience.  Thanks for posting.
Will use this from now on."
949477,29842,2009-03-06,5,"Delicious and simple!  I halved the recipe and used 2/3 cup mayo and 1/3 cup sour cream.  Turned out really well!  I also used apple cider vinegar.  

Thanks for posting!"
960625,29842,2009-03-23,5,"My DH usually only eats cole slaw when other side dish choices are limited.  He went back for thirds of this one!  He says it's the mustard that did it for him. He even helped me to make it for our upcoming church potluck, which I did to great success. The only changes I made: apple cider vinegar was all I had on hand and celery seed (for visual effect) and a dash of salt."
183968,29842,2009-03-26,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!! This is perfect slaw dressing.  I have tried for 10 years to make cole slaw that pleases my husband and finally this recipe has done it.  I didnt have enough mayo so I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  And my kids even gobbled it up."
160974,29842,2009-03-30,5,"I made this on the spur of the moment (to go with tuna burgers) and loved it. I added dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, and used over broccoli slaw. I could have eaten the whole bowl myself! I didn't see the celery salt at first, so I left it out, liking it fine ""as is."" My husband said it was much better than store bought cole slaw. I haven't ever had Marzetti's dressing before, but this is certainly fabulous. I think the yellow mustard is key! Thanks Bobbie, for another great recipe.
Roxygirl"
1188617,29842,2009-04-22,5,This was very good and easy to make. I did change the recipe a tad bit. I followed to recipe to a T and after all of the ingredients were combined I did a little taste test and decided it was a little to vinegary for my taste. So I added about 2 or 3 more tablespoons of mayo and about 1/3 cup more of sugar(the husband likes really sweet cole slaw). After another taste test we decided it was perfect. Thanks so much for posting.
886603,29842,2009-06-06,5,"Yummy!  I wanted broccoli slaw (made with the slaw mix, craisins, roasted soy nuts, raw sunflower seeds, and a little turkey bacon bits) but I wanted a healthier dressing than I could buy at the store.  This is amazing.  I cut this in half, and I have the leftover dressing in the fridge.  Changes I made: I used mayo made out of olive oil, apple cider vinegar, a pinch salt, and celery seed.   I'll be eating my slaw for the next few days!  Thanks for sharing this yummy dressing!"
274893,29842,2009-08-04,5,It should be called better then Marzettis! I used Splenda instead of sugar.
143946,29842,2009-08-11,5,Just what I was looking for! I really enjoyed the flavor and the simplicity of the recipe! :D Thank you!
1402399,29842,2009-10-02,5,"WOW! I really love this dressing. I used Splenda, added a splash more vinegar and a pinch more celery salt. I'm diabetic and love coleslaw. This sugar-free version is just what the doctor ordered. I bought some thin sliced rye bread today, lean corned beef, sliced white American cheese and plan on a fabulous grilled sandwich with slaw this weekend:)"
243873,29842,2009-12-07,4,"This is pretty close to Marzetti Slaw Dressing, and it's a whole lot cheaper! I add grated apple to my slaw, to give it a bit of sweetness."
89015,29842,2010-02-15,5,"Great dressing.  I added a little extra vinegar, a little pepper and a pinch of celery seed.  This is a keeper."
10404,29842,2010-05-03,5,"Great Dressing.  The only change I made was to use powdered sugar.  This seems to give it that ""Marzetti Texture"" that's sort of creamy/smooth.  My husband thought it was Marzetti's Slaw Dressing.  Came together under 2 minutes, flavor was exactly what I wanted, and there's enough dressing left over for tonights dinner!
Thanks for posting!
Di ;-)"
1212114,29842,2010-05-04,5,"Loved it!  Very much like Marzetti's, but I like it better.  Will never have to buy slaw dressing again."
531412,29842,2010-06-10,5,"I have a chicken salad recipe that I adore and since Marzetti's slaw dressing is an ingrediant, I tend to keep it on hand for just this recipe. Imagine my disappointment when a craving struck and I realized I was out of Marzettis!  Luckily I found this recipe and it worked spledidly!  Followed exactly except just slightly decreased mustard.   Will use this from now on!  Thanks so much for posting!"
597669,29842,2010-06-11,5,"I try and use splenda whenever possible.  This dressing is superb, used it with finely shredded cabbage and broccoli stem mixture.  Definately a keeper and thanks for posting."
1647880,29842,2010-07-06,5,I made this recipe tonight using Miracle Whip and it is absolutely delicious!  Exactly what I was looking for!
1365025,29842,2010-10-11,4,This was good even though I couldn't  get that much sugar to dissolve. It was pretty sweet tasting. I'll make this again but next time I'll use less sugar and less vinegar. I used the white vinegar as stated  but next time I'll try apple cider vinegar like some of the other reviewers did.
1196352,29842,2011-09-26,5,"Great - it is very similar to Marzetti's which I always use, but can't get where I am now.  I only had Dijon mustard - but that worked well.  Maybe I will try spenda next time."
2321630,29842,2012-07-08,5,Good recipe. Very similar to Marzetti. I used another reviewers suggestion to use powdered sugar and it blended in smoothly with the mayonnaise.
2397630,29842,2012-09-10,3,"Undissolved sugar =yuk. <br/>Solution = measure vinegar in glass measuring cup and add sugar. Microwave in 30 second intervals, and stirring in between until dissolved, cool, continue with recipe :-)"
1102578,29842,2012-12-25,5,This was a nice easy dressing that tasted somewhat like Marzetti's.  I used bagged coleslaw mix so my salad went together in a snap.  Would make again.  Thanks for the recipe!
2796486,29842,2013-04-22,5,"it was a little bit different than Marzetti&#039;s in a good way. I prefer this dressing to theirs, it is sweeter and not as &quot;bitey&quot;.  Will become my standard."
369715,29842,2013-04-23,4,I used a bag of coleslaw mix. I have never tried Marzetti dressing so I don&#039;t have anything to compare it to but we did enjoy this. It does make a lot of dressing and I used it all on one bag. Next time I think I would use two bags.
131126,29842,2013-05-11,5,Nice dressing. I made this to use on Mazetti&#039;s Southern Pecan Slaw and found the dressing had similar texture and flavor.  A keeper!
140132,29842,2013-05-28,5,I made this last night to go with our fish dinner.  I did 1/4 the recipe as I only had half a cabbage.  We loved it.  Thank you for sharing.
2864622,29842,2013-06-15,5,"Really great dressing! Even my 87-year-old Mom likes it and she swore she&#039;d never eat a &quot;creamy&quot; dressing in her life! It does taste like Marzetti&#039;s; however, I also used apple cider vinegar, added 1 tsp. black pepper, and used only 1/2 cup of sugar. It&#039;s delicious - thanks so much! I used it on bagged slaw veggies so I had twice as much as I needed for that, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find a wonderful use for the remaining half!"
502302,29842,2013-07-13,5,"I&#039;m surprised I&#039;ve never rated this. I really love it. Seems to be just the right amount of everything. I like it that the recipe is easily halved and stored for leftovers. I also used it in place of the dressing in Recipe #103254 and it worked perfectly. ETA- also I always use apple-cider vinegar.Update: Four years later and still using this exclusively. I have been experimenting with reducing the vinegar in my diet since I showed allergy to mold on one test and all fermented foods are cousins to mold. I can&#039;t do anything about the vinegar in the mayo but thought I would reduce what I could. To the sugar I added: 1 tsp ascorbic acid (unbuffered vitamin C powder) and 2 tsp powdered mustard. Then mixed in 1/4 cup water before adding the whole thing back into the mayo. Seemed to come out just right. I did taste more of a mayo flavor but I think if I tweaked the ingredients any more, the the flavors would be off."
53932,29842,2014-03-16,5,This is great!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and might reduce the amount next time.
2754389,29842,2014-04-18,5,"This is basically how I make mine, with a tad less sugar.  I usually buy the tri-colored cole slaw mix that also has purple cabbage and carrots. I do add a little black pepper and a little celery seed instead of the celery salt.  Most packaged mixes consists of long, coarse strands of veggies so I pulse it a couple of times in the food processor before adding the dressing.  BBQ, fried seafood, and fried chicken just ain&#039;t the same without a good cole slaw!"
1802771355,29842,2014-05-26,5,"Terrific and easy! I added sugar to taste, which was roughly 3tbps. I really liked to addition of the celery salt....Chicago would be proud! I will definitely use this from now on!"
45454229,29842,2016-08-11,0,"I've made such a similar recipe for so many years. Yes, I use Splenda and dijon mustard. If I have light mayo w/O.O. and light Miracle Whip, I use both. Taste and taste until it's perfect."
2001435085,29842,2017-03-14,0,Does anyone have anything near Marzetti's &quot;Sweet Italian Dressing&quot; --can't buy overseas where we live and miss it!
45351910,29842,2017-09-10,5,"This is like Marzetti's but without the bitter/chemical aftertaste. Everyone here likes it! Rather than load up with more salt, I used celery seed. It is also very easy to make since I keep all of the ingredients on hand. For a large party, I multiplied this by six, and used powdered sugar (as another review mentions). Perfect texture!"
2001623248,29842,2018-02-16,0,"when substituting granulated sugar for powdered sugar, so you still use 2/3 cup or do you reduce the amount?"
950193,29842,2018-07-09,5,"I was in the middle of making slaw and was almost out of the &quot;real&quot; Marzetti Slaw Dressing. I remembered this recipe that I had saved on Pinterest. I made it as written, except I used regular mayonnaise instead of the light version. It was just perfect! It tasted nearly identical to the &quot;real&quot; stuff. I put about 1 cup of the dressing to 1 pound of cabbage or slaw mix. Thanks for the wonderful clone!"
481092,307536,2008-06-14,5,"Wonderful addition to my steak tonight.  I did really venture off and subbed cilantro for the parsely.  One because it's what I had on hand, two because I love it, and three it seems more relevant to South America.  Excellent results, highly recommend.  For  ZWT."
246844,307536,2008-06-23,5,This was fantastic.  I used New York strips because that's what I had in the freezer but made the sauce just as written.  It really brought out the flavor of the meat.  Thanks for sharing!  For ZWT
297076,307536,2008-06-30,5,Tom LOVED this. We did make 2 small changes. We did 3/4 cup parsley and 1/4 cup cilantro. We also used half of the red wine vinegar and subbed lime for the other half. We were going for a lime type of dinner overall and that small substitution really brought it all together. Most excellent. Made for ZWT.
498271,307536,2009-11-22,5,This is a great way to serve steak!  The sauce was a great complement to the beef and easy to make.  Thanks for posting this recipe!
47559,307536,2011-05-29,4,"I have a lot of parsley growing in the garden and thought this would be a great way to use it.  We really enjoyed the fresh bright flavor and thought it went very well with the simple grilled sirloin.  I used the blender, and it made more of a puree.  Next time I would use a little less garlic.  The raw garlic flavor was a bit pronounced for our tastes."
80353,307536,2014-08-19,5,Seriously good!  The sauce is excellent and adds substantially to a great cut of bbq&#039;d beef.  We grilled to medium-rare and served in mini pitas drizzled with more sauce and some salad for really excellent sandwiches.  Thanks for a great recipe.
266635,307536,2014-08-23,5,"Made this delicious sauce tonight to go on our steaks.  I cubed up ribeye steaks vs. using sirloin and placed them on skewers.  They were wonderful with the chimichurri sauce.  Served with black beans and rice. Made for Culinary Quest - South America, 2014."
1925885,307536,2014-09-15,4,"This was a good chimichurri sauce and will make it again. But, will slightly reduce the vinegar, as it was a bit too much for us. We don&#039;t eat much meat, so we just pan-fried a New York strip to rare, then thinly sliced it to share between the two of us.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
131021,35632,2010-06-26,5,"This was so good, we put it on turkey and havarti croissant sandwiches and it was perfect. I made a quarter batch and used a bit more garlic so it was strong but that was still great. YUM."
14784,223423,2008-06-10,5,"It is the best sace in the wirld. I subtituted my own cider vinegar, that I made from scratch. Great JOB!!! Nikki"
144204,223423,2010-08-01,2,Finaly had a chance to make this. The egg kinda threw us for a loop. Being from WNY this isn't any thing like we've had. We've had Chivetta's from Chivetta's BBQ palace. It doesn't look like Chivetta's and i didn't see egg any where on the label. I did think this would be great for pork or fish.
1663891,223423,2010-08-10,5,it may not look like the stuff we buy at the grocery store but it is awesome. I learned of making this from scratch while I was shopping one day! The store I was at didn't carry it and a clerk told me to try it from scratch! The egg is not necessary but does help it stick.
280271,431932,2010-07-11,5,"These are soooo...yummy! If you like heat, you got heat, if you like sweet, you got sweet. What more can you ask for. So easy to throw together. Loved them on a salad. I'm going to use them on my next BLT sandwich. Can't wait. Thanks for posting. :)"
383346,431932,2010-07-25,5,This is so yummy.  Sweet and spicy.  But it was more spicy than sweet.  I loved it.  Thanks Gailanng :)  Made for Potluck tag game
226863,431932,2010-08-03,5,Loved the taste of these....my only warning is to be careful letting them drain on paper towels!  The sugar makes the paper towel stick to the bacon.  I had to peel the paper towels off.  But these are absolutely delicious....slap my face and go ahead and eat all that fat yummy!
593927,358587,2009-05-22,5,I made half a batch of this for 2 for breakfast. I used Granny Smith apples and DH found it too sweet to his liking. So next time I will use tart apples if available or cut down on the sugar. I made double the topping because that is the best part. I had to use a combination of sucanat sugar and maple syrup as I didn't have enough sugar. I made this gluten free by using white rice flour in replacement of the all purpose flour. I used gluten free quick oats which was fine but do not use instant as I believe that will not work. I omitted the walnuts out of preference and substituted canola oil for the margarine as we are dairy free I used less because of the additional liquid in the form of maple syrup. I had to use bottled lemon juice this time but next time I would use fresh. I also added about double the amount of cinnamon in the apple mixture and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top when it was all put together ready to go in the oven. I served it with maple syrup on the side and rice milk but DH didnt use either and I found it sweet enough without but did add a drizzle of maple syrup to mine. I will make this again as dessert or breakfast.
526666,431932,2010-08-19,5,"Sugar, with heat, makes a spicy treat! Now, I just have to figure out a way to incorporate this into ALL my meals...I get it, for sandwiches and crumbled on a salad, but, I WANT MORE! My first time with sriracha and the flavor is unique, and it does pack a little 'heat punch!' I used a thick bacon and cooked for approximately 20 minutes and it could have gone for a couple of minutes longer, to be really crunchy. The way I did it is wonderful, if it must be re-heated. I also laid the bacon on the paper towel, QUICKLY removing them, so some of the grease was absorbed, but, the sugar didn't stick! Be sure to use plenty of cooking spray (or parchment paper) and don't let the pan cool off....makes quite a 'sticky' mess. Thanks so much for sharing your delicious creation, Gailann!"
228172,431932,2010-10-25,5,"This is awesome! It's like spicy candied bacon. I would never have thought of using sriracha sauce on bacon, but this is soooooo good. I cooked up just a couple of slices to try it out the first time around, but I'll definitely be making this over and over again. (I did have to cook longer than directed, but my oven tends to run a little low on the heat.) Thanks for posting this!"
1710739,431932,2010-11-12,4,"Ok, I made a vegan, LESS-Sugar, version of this using ""MorningStar Farms"" vegetarian bacon and instead of sugar of any kind, I used: Cinnamon! (cinnamon is essential in balancing blood-sugar spikes and is loaded with anti-oxidants)  I used the Cinnamon on half (just in case it wasn't a great combination) and the other half with just the Chili sauce. Plus, this was my first time making ""fac'n bac'n"" in the oven.  Usually I do it on the stove top a few minutes on each side or in the microwave.  I was a little scared at the time 20-25 minutes, but you know.... I don't think I'm going to make it any other way.  The vegetarian bacon doesn't really get crispy on the stove top or microwave, and I just accepted that was the compromise I was making by going meatless.  Never occured to me to put it in the oven!  And don't get be started on the sriracha sauce!  If you know me, you know I'm going through a bottle of hot sauce and about 2 jars of cayenne pepper a week and I put it on everything because capsascin is great for your cirsulation.  I did cut the Sriracha with chili powder, red pepper flakes, cayenne, a little vinegar (just enough to lubricate everything) and some garlic powder, just because there's a LOT of sugar in store bought Sriracha, and I wanted the taste and the heat minus the sugar.  The combination of Sriracha, the veggie bacon and Cinnamon was terrific! There's enough sugar in Sriracha sauce that it's reduntant to add any more.  I figured cinnamon would be a good option to offset the little sugar I'd be getting from the Sriracha sauce.  It was a delish treat, but not something I can indulge in everyday."
305531,431932,2011-02-05,5,"TDF!!! I only made 4 slices to begin with just for me. Then my grandson and a couple of his friends showed up. Bad news, lol. They ate all of it and loved it! Then I made another batch thinking that I would be alone that night. Wrong again, lol! And so....made a 3rd batch the next day. I was able to hide a couple of pieces to use in recipe #430880 which took this awesome dip to a higher level!!<br/>Oh gosh GailAnn, I now understand your love of sriracha! I'm searching and saving recipes as we speak!! Thanks so much for a simple awesome recipe that makes me look like a star! This will indeed be included in my Best of 2011 CB. Made for Best of 2010 Tag."
65502,431932,2011-07-21,5,GailAnn did it again! This is SOOOOO good! I really like sriracha chili sauce and this lets you enjoy a hint of heat or blow-your-head-off heat! I had mine somewhere in the middle! Made for PRMR recipe tag game. Thanks GailAnn! :)
145352,431932,2012-02-20,5,"Oh my!!! I am now addicted!!! I thought these might be good, but I had no idea how good!!! I could eat this all by myself!"
502988,431932,2013-03-24,0,Brilliant.
1179225,431932,2013-07-07,5,"Smoky, spicy, salty, sweet and delicious. Next time I&#039;ll bake it on a rack, I think it would help the bacon to crisp up a bit better. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe."
2000081110,431932,2015-03-22,5,"Makes an excellent wrap for meatloaf - wrap bacon around the meatloaf, brush on a healthy amount of sriracha, dust with brown sugar, and bake as normal. Broiling for a couple minutes when done baking crisps it up nicely."
13483,11915,2001-10-03,4,"I made a dinner for two with this.  I added some shredded carrot, some garlic and salsa.  May add some cheese near the end of cooking next time.
Was a great vegetarian meal (and I am not a vegetarian but do like most veggie recipes!)  Thanks for sharing this."
22903,11915,2001-11-05,5,I added a can of corned beef to this recipe and my family liked it better than fried corned beef and cabbage.
31914,11915,2002-04-02,4,This was scrumptous!!! I may add more soup next time and maybe a sprinkling of cheese.
20076,11915,2002-04-05,0,"My husband loves cabbage, but when he tasted this he wanted to know ""what in the world is this stuff?""  He shoved it aside after the first bite.  I thot it was ok but why waste cabbage?"
60351,11915,2002-11-19,4,Easy to make - Great flavor!
101732,11915,2006-10-30,4,"This was pretty good. My DD loved it...anything cabbage. I added i extra can of cream of mushroom,like another reviewer suggested,to make it creamier. Thanks for posting!"
806225,11915,2008-04-02,5,Very tasty! Might try a different creamed soup next time to experiment. Recipe is a KEEPER!
126104,11915,2008-10-21,5,"I didn't feel like making a special sauce, or grating cheese, so I made this recipe, not expecting to actually like it. Well, I LOVED IT. I followed the recipe exactly, except I think I baked it a little longer than called for. It was VERY moist, and the soup thoroughly cooked the cabbage and onion. The next time, I might add breadcrumbs on top just to see how that works, but this will be a favorite just as is. I warmed leftover tonite, and they were delicious. Thanks ""P"", but a new favorite and easy cabbage casserole."
673444,11915,2008-10-28,4,"This was pretty good.  I originally forgot to add the onion, so fried it in a little olive oil to brown then added it to the casserole before serving.  Turned out well. Easy to make. Thanks."
840741,11915,2009-03-16,5,"This was a great hit at dinner last night, even though I forgot the onion as I was in a rush getting other dishes ready.  I added a teaspoon of hot red pepper flakes and it turned out quite spicy, which my husband loved.  So simple and so satisfying.  Thanks for a new way to make cabbage!"
29956,37056,2003-05-13,5,"Tasty,simple and will be cooking them again. Didn't have the BBQ fired up so cooked them in the oven. Good side dish."
424680,37056,2007-05-08,5,"Made for PAC, Spring 2007 ~ Yet another great way to jazz up a side of carrots! I did these in the oven, since we have no BBQ, but what the hey ~ They are still great tasting!! Thanks for the recipe!"
58038,37056,2007-07-24,3,"These were okay but not spectacular.  The flavor was a bit more subtle that I would have liked and while they weren't mushy, I guess I prefer a crunchier carrot."
278546,11915,2009-03-27,4,"To be honest I was so skeptical about this recipe I stuck the casserole into the oven wishing it luck. I prepared it as a single-course lunch using only half a head of cabbage and a can of Cream of Mushroom with Ham, then added in ground pork (quickly marinated with a dash of soy sauce, white pepper and oregano), and used shallots instead of onion. The outcome was surprisingly yummy! It was great served with fresh ground pepper and probably a touch of Tabasco. Very easy to prepare!"
391800,11915,2009-04-21,5,I didn't actually have any of this - I made it for my husband tonight. I made as written except I used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom. He loved it and told me to add it to the rotation. So easy to make! Thanks for sharing!
207326,11915,2009-04-24,5,"I sent my daughter to the store for a head of lettuce and she came back with a cabbage! My husband WILL NOT EAT CABBAGE! yet, I found myself STUCK with one, so I searched in vain found this recipe and said, I cooked it you eat it or I'll never cook again. He ate this and LOVED IT.  He even told the kids it was nasty so THEY WOULDN'T EAT IT, LEAVING MORE FOR HIM.  He took the leftovers to work with him for lunch.  I am amazed, shocked and awed by this.  And you can bet we will be having cabbage for the first time in 20 years of marriage.  bravo P. and THANK YOU"
612601,11915,2010-02-17,4,"Simple & tasty, just added a little hot sauce for some zip."
1006712,11915,2010-04-11,5,"This was very good. I added some Russian Kielbasa and baked it a little longer. Never did add any pepper or salt, did not need it. Great low calorie side dish. Thank you for sharing!"
29014,11915,2011-02-13,5,"This was SO good and easy.  In the past, I have made a more time-consuming scalloped cabbage with homemade cream sauce and this is SO much easier.  Plus you can make ahead and bake when ready.  I used cream-o-chicken soup (no special reason) and added some shredded cheese blend.  Only used one-half head of cabbage so this was extra creamy.  We loved it ~ a keeper!  Thanks for posting."
2001175921,11915,2016-09-20,0,I guess I need more flavorful food. This is too bland.
1535,37056,2007-08-07,4,What a great way to prepare carrots when you've got the grill going anyway. I didn't have any tarragon but we all liked the carrots without it. I grilled mine over charcoal for 20 minutes and they were just right. I also really liked no clean up afterwards. :) Thanks!
222478,37056,2007-12-25,5,Really tasty and quick way to do some carrots on the BBQ! Nice blend of flavours everyone enjoyed.
228672,37056,2008-04-12,4,One of the few grilled carrot recipes that I've found.  Easy & good.  My cooking  time was definitely closer to 20 minutes & the carrots were still a little crisp - yum!
29999,14178,2002-01-29,4,"I've been looking for this recipe for awhile now--it's so simple, but it's soo good!  The first time I had it, I thought that it was ambrosia (I was sorely disappointed when I got some ""real"" ambrosia)."
39479,14178,2002-05-02,5,"Delicious!  I was worried because I had never made a punch b4.  Everyone just luved it!  I even received compliments from the bride to be and her mother thanking me for making this punch for the shower.  Only thing I would change is maybe half the amount of ginger ale.  Otherwise, EXELLENT!! :-)"
2001956563,298874,2018-01-27,0,Was perfect for our family who turned last night’s chicken fingers into a great southern breakfast.
339025,298874,2008-06-08,4,"I tried this recipe when i was trying to decide what to with with some left over biscuits. I did not have sausage, so the title clicked. I made the recipe minus the poultry seasoning (due to personally not caring for that seasoning). I then poured the gravy over the biscuits and popped them in the oven for a few minutes. The gravy had soaked in and the biscuits were to die for! Yummy!"
453828,298874,2008-07-10,5,"Love it!  I was looking for a recipe to make ""gravy"" for rice knowing that my lemon chicken (to accompany the rice and vegetable side dishes) would not produce enough drippings to make gravy.  I cut the recipe in half, and used 3/4 cup low sodium chicken broth and 1/4 cup half&half, and only used about 1/2 tsp homemade poultry seasoning.  Otherwise, I followed the directions/ingredients as written.  I loved the consistency, flavor and ease of preparation, and will make it again and again.  For biscuits, rice, vegetables, chicken, and whatever else might need added moisture and flavor!  Thanks for an easy and versatile recipe."
382322,298874,2009-03-25,5,This is a GREAT sollution to a common problem. I usually cook link sausage and NEVER have enough drippings. THANK YOU for posting. I am a Yankee girl married to a Dixie boy... I am adding this one to my recipe box of tricks!
341344,298874,2009-05-15,5,"Growing up, I didn't realize you could use drippings to make gravy, because we always made it with butter.  We brown the flour in the pan by itself, and use evaporated milk instead of regular.  Either way, it makes a veggie friendly gravy that still tastes decadent!"
1063227,298874,2009-07-24,5,"This was so good and so easy! I was worried that I wasn't going to find a recipe for gravy without some sort of fat, but I liked this more than stuff made with fat anyway!"
1179225,298874,2011-12-10,5,We really loved this gravy. I was craving biscuits and gravy and only had a few sausage links. We found your recipe and I'm so glad we tried it. I normally get an upset stomach after eating sausage gravy due to all the fat. I was able to eat and enjoy a full serving of this tasty gravy. I'm not sure if its a good or bad thing to be able to east biscuits and gravy more oftern. Thanks so much for posting your recipe. I know I'll be making it again.
2216652,298874,2012-03-20,1,"I made this gravy exactly according to the recipe. I didnt care for the taste. nor did it come to a boil as it was supposed to. I ended up having to put in a packaged gravy mix made into a rou(?) just to thicken it up. if I make this again, it will most definately be without the poultry seasoning."
2868065,298874,2013-06-18,5,My family and i LOVED this recipe! Was a little iffy about using the chicken seasoning at first but it flavored it quite nicely! First no sausage recipe I have tried and had it actually turn out. I used sausage links and added them to this gravy... Fantastic!!
42223864,298874,2013-09-06,5,Watch the salt... I used a poultry seasoning that had salt in it. When I did it without the salt it was fantastic. It would make fantastic chicken gravy as well
1800050891,298874,2013-11-22,5,"I&#039;m very happy I found this recipe! I only added a little salt, a good amount of pepper, and a very good amount of ground sage! The only way you can tell it doesn&#039;t have sausage in it is because there aren&#039;t any actual pieces of meat! Sage is great! (: My 1 year old and I ate until we were full! I can&#039;t wait to make this for my husband!"
1802319664,298874,2014-01-13,4,"This is the perfect gravy if you like regular biscuits and gravy, but are trying to go vegetarian. HOWEVER, I changed the recipe. I made it exactly as described here and didn&#039;t like it (had to throw it out). The way I made it next and to my liking was everything the same, EXCEPT - 1/4 tsp Pure Maple Syrup added to melted butter before adding flour, and 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning. The original called-for 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning was WAY too much, so the reduced 1/4 teaspoon makes it just right. It tastes just like regular sausage gravy (I used to make mine with maple sausage)."
215922,298874,2014-01-17,5,"I just tried this recipe for breakfast and loved it!  I was tired of my usual egg and toast, but didn&#039;t want a plain English muffin and then remembered seeing this recipe last night.  I halved the recipe and added the sage/poultry seasoning and salt and pepper to taste and topped a toasted English muffin with about half the sauce.  It definitely hit the spot.  I never realized the seasoning I love so much in breakfast sausage is sage/poultry seasoning!   I am saving the rest for my husband to try when he gets home from work.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Bravo!"
2000157964,298874,2015-12-29,5,I didn&#039;t make any changes and it tastes just like gravy made with sausage.
2001176126,298874,2016-09-20,5,Tasted absolutely amazing! And to give it a little kick I did a pinch of crushed red peppers and the smallest pinch of cian pepper(may of spelled that wrong) and it tasted absolutely perfect. Definitely plan to make this a lot.
2001795303,298874,2017-11-14,5,On a fly I found this ah 5:30am this morning. Put it all together no tweaking and it tastes so good. Can't wait to wake him up to enjoy it on some biscuits!!
9133,14178,2002-06-30,5,"this one is the best!!!
I make it with 2 cans of frozen lemonade instead of the pineapple juice. Follow the rest of recipe as shown.   It's awesome and a huge hit no matter which type of sherbert I add to it. 
I used it at showers, office parties, wind up dues for all my club stuff. Everyone luvs it.
thanks for sharing your recipe with us."
64309,14178,2002-12-15,5,"This punch is great!  I followed the recipe exactly for my daughter's 2-year birthday party -- and was a bit worried at first because it didn't taste very sweet at all or even like it had much flavor.  But once it sat for a few minutes and the flavors mingled together, and once we started eating, the flavor of the punch really came through -- and it was definitely sweet enough but not too sweet.  Perfect punch -- HUGE hit with my toddler!"
87236,14178,2005-01-04,5,"I've made this twice now, and both times it was a hit!  I halved the recipe, as the full amount would have been too much to fit into my punch bowl.  As it was, even half the recipe went a long way!  I spooned the sherbet into the bowl with an ice cream scoop, and mixed gently.  I waited about five minutes before serving, to allow the sherbet time melt a little, and blend with the other flavors in the punch.  This is a keeper, Wende!  Thanks!"
199198,14178,2006-05-16,5,"I made this punch for my son's graduation reception party, and it was a big hit! I also used lime sherbet, and the color was so pretty. I lost track of how many times we had to refill the punch bowl! This was also the same punch we had at our wedding 28 years ago.. I was so glad to find it here to use again! Thanks! Hazeleyes"
199839,14178,2006-07-17,4,"I also used Frozen lemonaid, it was very tasty. I accidentally bough Sorbet instead of Sherbert so it wasn't creamy, but still tasted alright."
416292,14178,2007-09-10,5,I made this for my bridal shower and it was such a big hit!!! I looked around the room and saw that 30 out of the 35 people had it in their cup. I used rainbow sherbet and only 1/2 can of pineapple juice so it wasn't so sweet... I definitley will make again!
437973,14178,2008-09-20,5,This was a great punch!  I made it last weekend for my sister-in-law's baby shower AND am making it again for my other sister-in-law's baby shower on tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe!  Everyone loved it.
365507,14178,2008-10-28,5,YUM! Used raspberry sherbet & only 46oz of pineapple juice.
1632774,14178,2011-04-02,5,"All i had available was orange cream sherbert which i was a little concerned about, but it turned out to be a hit! Next time i'll try adding 1/2 a can of pineapple juice to cut down a little bit on the sweetness! But this recipe is def. a baby shower staple!"
2001568398,14178,2017-06-04,0,do you have to add ice?
2002313717,298874,2018-10-27,5,"This was so good! It was my first time making gravy and it turned out fantastic. My picky husband and kids made sure there was nothing left! So I made some tweaks. Before starting the gravy, I fried a diced onion in a little bit of oil until browned. I then added the butter and flour to the pot and followed directions from there. I used almond milk instead of cow's milk, and once it was boiling, I threw in some pre-chopped grilled chicken and mixed it all together. Let it sit for a few minutes to thicken, then ladled it over biscuits. This was such a hearty, delicious breakfast. The kids want it again tomorrow morning!"
2002323255,298874,2018-11-06,5,This turned out great!
204735,221422,2007-11-07,4,Everyone else loved this and they were gone very quickly.  I guess I just don't like turnovers.
1010725,338711,2008-12-07,3,Not bad but FAR too sweet and doesn't seem to set well.
180090,214064,2007-04-01,5,This quick and easy recipe made a great dinner with biscuits. This is great if you are on a budget or short on time! Thanks for posting!
539309,214064,2007-09-06,5,"Delicious! Iâ€™m in the process of moving house at the moment and wanted something quick and simple, this was ideal!! Was a little concerned when I added the BBQ sauce, just that I thought the recipe call for seem to small, I couldnâ€™t of been more wrong! It gave just a nice little kick! Thanks for posting a great recipe."
2894068,214064,2013-09-16,0,"Just made it tonight.  I doubled the recipe to make it last for several days.  Super simple, very fast to prepare and really yummy.  My son even thanked me for making it.  My younger mega picky eater did not like it.  What else is new?"
2000498330,214064,2015-10-21,3,"Was somewhat bland, made as written. Doubled the bbq sauce and added 1 tsp salt and pepper. Much better with those changes."
372295,38556,2007-06-27,4,I made this recipe for my 3 chefs. It was very simple to make and really tasty.
601358,38556,2009-11-18,5,"This happens to be one of my family's favorite holiday menu items.  It's been in the family for years and we wouldn't think of getting together without making it.  Definitely an unusual taste, and it usually takes people by surprise when they first try it because they're not expecting the bite of the vinegar.  It only keeps a day, but it doesn't last long at our table anyway."
542159,452574,2011-04-06,3,What a tasty way to start the day after adding milk.  Fallowed directions and had Paste so add one cup of milk and blended some more to end up with a nice flavorful breakfast drink. Thanks for the post.
163112,169348,2007-09-14,3,"This received mixed reviews - 7yo LOVED it, 10yo hated it & I liked it.  I personally think this has way too much turmeric.  I doubled the eggs because i didn't see 3 eggs making enough for the 3 of us.  6 eggs was just right.  The only cheese I had was swiss & I don't recommend it, lol.  If not the recommended goat cheese, stick with something milder!  Made for the 9/07 Aussie Swap."
510313,169348,2008-06-22,4,"Made & reviewed for ZWT 4 - Kumquat's Kookin' Kaboodles! Having read the previous review I used 6 eggs, feta (goat/sheep cheese) & just 1 tsp of turmeric....the final dish was really delicious & we all enjoyed it! This is basically an African omelette lol, DS was the first to spot that! Thanks Kimberly for another lovely recipe :)"
192581,169348,2008-06-29,5,"This was delicious, 5* with the herbed goat cheese I added (around 3 ounces total). I used egg beaters instead of eggs (the equivalent of 4 eggs), and greatly reduced the vegetable oil. Took the advice of a prior reviewer and added 1 teaspoon turmeric instead of 1 tablespoon, but I think it could have used more. I served this with a potato side, very good! Another ZWT recipe. Thanks Blue Rose!"
43005,27076,2002-08-20,3,"I came across this while looking for alternatives to potatos.  The flavor is good but it was missing something for me.  I will definitely use this again and see if I can ""punch it up"" a bit.  I might try using mozzarella or even cheddar in place of the parmesan."
55406,27076,2002-11-16,5,"This was a really flavorful dish, came out something like a souffle.  I added a couple cloves of elephant garlic and took the suggestion and added 1/2 mozzarella, 1/2 parmesan (probably a little more than 1/4 cup)  It came out surprisingly flavorful, and furthermore, it's good for us!"
94769,27076,2007-06-22,5,I love turnips and this recipe was a good one for me.  I added some cajun seasoning for some extra zing.  Thanks!
1219551,27076,2009-10-21,5,We made this last night. My husband and I were very impressed! We did add Mrs. Dash (original bled) for a little kick in flavor.
1380057,27076,2010-09-22,5,Was a little doubty about this recipie! Well it turned out great! My hubby and son loved it as well! Nice way to replace the patatoes and what a delicious taste and texture. I will be making this again for sure. Oh! I replaced the parmesan with mozarella cheese and added baby speenachs cut finely. <br/>thanks <br/>Shannon :-)
1120061,27076,2011-01-16,0,"Ii used creme fresh instead of sour cream, as thats what i had in the fridge, and cheddar instead of parmesan and this turned out great.I agree with laurita it did come out a bit like a souffle and it was lovely i will be making this a lot, thank you so much for sharing this recipe."
453440,27076,2012-03-04,4,"Because my turnips weren't tennis ball size, I added another turnip to have the needed amount of turnips and added 2cloves of garlic when I boiled them.   I followed the recipe.  I did  add some salt and pepper when I put them in the processor.  The result after the processor seemed too thin.  I added 2 Tbs bread crumbs and 1 minced scallion.  After baked, it was fantastic, in texture and taste.  However, the next time I make it I will only use one one egg. (Won't need the breadcrumbs-which I would prefer not to do.)  It was great to have with the gravy I had and I was able to skip the potatoe."
632249,27076,2014-02-22,4,"I used frozen, cubed turnip for this recipe and it was good, but I&#039;m sure that fresh turnip is better.  If anyone else is using frozen turnip, drain it well after boiling and press down on it gently to get more water out. I will make this again, it is a nice change from the usual. Thanks!"
1663024,27076,2014-10-26,5,"I agree that raw turnips are so difficult to cut. After badly cutting my thumb the last time that I peeled raw turnips, I am wary of doing that again. I avoided both cutting and peeling by baking the whole, unpeeled, scrubbed turnips at 400F degrees for one hour in a covered Corningware dish. There is no need to add water or oil because turnips naturally have a high water content. After allowing them to cool, I easily slipped their skin right off and squeezed out the excess juices. A surprisingly huge amount of liquid rendered. I added four cloves of roasted garlic to mimic the garlic mashed potatoes that I adore. Beating the eggs until very frothy is the key to achieving a fluffy souffl&eacute; texture. Baked Turnip &#039;taters rose high into a golden brown delight. Thank you, Julesong, for this creamy, smooth, and delicious side dish."
75138,81917,2004-04-27,4,"I recently make this recipe and added 2 T dark rum with the mable syrup.  I also found that there is only enough banana mixture for 6 purses, not 12. If you divide the amount between 12, there isn't nearly enough if each serving.  So if you make 12, just double the amount of filling."
43083,375903,2009-12-31,4,This was pretty tasty. I enjoyed the lemon juice on top. I did decide to use garlic powder instead. Thanks for posting this easy recipe:)
914002,456618,2011-06-01,5,I had this once before at at Moroccan friends home and it was a delicious desert! I'm glad that you posted this recipe. I will make it myself now! Thanks!
65502,477848,2012-11-08,5,"I have never made pudding like this but I will be making it again! I did double the amount of honey and vanilla after tasting it. Due to the cold climate right now, I had to use frozen raspberries and they were just perfect with this! Made for my adopted chef for Fall PAC 2012. Thanks Rainbow*Bubbles! :)"
2001124799,477848,2016-08-12,5,I also doubled the honey and vanilla after taste testing this. It will be used in another dessert and depending on how that comes out this may become a family favorite. Thank you.
2001350784,477848,2017-01-14,0,Is there a breakdown of the nutritional values of the pudding for diabetic reasons?
424680,166482,2008-11-01,5,"Did make this up to use with some chicken breasts, but, I tell ya, IT'S GREAT ON ICE CREAM, too! Included the nuts & the combo of flavors was wonderful! Thanks for sharing a keeper of a recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed for My-3-Chefs]"
341142,215826,2007-03-28,5,Lovely shake. Used a frozen banana and topped with some wheat germ for a nutritious start to my day.
141293,215826,2007-04-17,5,"Nice frozen, frothy shake.  This was very thick because I used both frozen berries and banana.  Also used ff vanilla yogurt.  Thinned with a little skim milk.  Really filling"
128473,215826,2007-04-18,5,"I made this shake for breakfast Juenessa. What a tasty treat. I used 1 1/2 bananas and 1 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries, vanilla bean yogurt and alfalfa honey. I didn't need any ice cubes. This was a lovely, thick, rich, smooth shake. I enjoyed this very much, thanks for sharing."
427184,215826,2007-11-24,5,"Mm, very nice, I loved the yogurt. I used a plain 1% yogurt. This was a very good breakfast, thanks!"
166642,215826,2008-01-12,5,This is a really delicious and refreshing shake. I used frozen blueberries and bananas because I really like a thick shake. Great flavor!
107135,111072,2006-04-26,5,this is one of the 1st cakes i learned to make . i loved this recipe .thanks for posting dee
328169,111072,2006-07-08,5,Easy and goooood.Edge
44160,111072,2008-07-02,5,"Good cake! Great to turn into a 6 layer cake. Either cut the three layers in half or bake 6 layers, about 15 minutes at 350. A good frosting recipe to go with this is: 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup butter, 2/3 cup half-and-half, 2 tablespoon corn syrup, 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1 (16-ounce) box confectioners' sugar, sifted, plus 1 cup, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix sugar, cocoa, butter, half-and-half, corn syrup, and salt in a saucepan, stir, and bring to a boil. Continue to boil, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes or until thick. Remove syrup from heat, and beat in the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract with an electric mixer. Allow frosting to rest for a couple of minutes. At this time, if the frosting is too thick for spreading, add a bit of half-and-half, 1 tablespoon at a time, to bring frosting to proper spreading consistency."
407278,111072,2008-08-06,5,"This was the only cake my grandmother knew how to make, so I'm the third generation to use it.  It's also delicious with some grated coconut thrown in, and with coconut icing.  It will also survive being made with EggBeaters, skim milk, etc., if you worry about that.  Terrific cake recipe."
490764,111072,2008-09-03,5,"Wonderful recipe! Last week, I made a coconut cake with 1/2 cup coconut added to batter and I added some coconut to frosting and topped it off with a little toasted coconut.

Also, today, I tried this out for a 12""  marble cake. I need two 12"" tiers for a wedding cake soon and one recipe is perfect for one 12"" layer. I mixed as directions state and then reserved 1 1/2 cup of the mix which I added 1/4 cup cocoa to for the marbling effect."
1138677,111072,2009-01-21,0,"This was my dear Mom's recipe and the first one she taught me! Thanks for the wonderful memory. The only difference was she separated her eggs, added only the yolks when the recipe calls for ""eggs"" and whipped the egg whites till they peak. When the batter is done, fold in the egg whites and the vanilla. Makes a super light cake!"
570804,111072,2009-04-21,5,"This is the best butter type layer cake I have ever used and, I also, got it from my mother.  Very versatile and can be used for many purposes, including strawberry shortcake.   My favourite topping is a chocolate fudge icing.  Suggest that new bakers do not substitute margarine for the butter and also no shortcuts when it comes to the beating of the butter and sugar.  My only negative comment (and this is personal preference) I still prefer to separate the yolks from the whites and fold in the latter.
Thanks for submitting this cake Fauve."
114027,111072,2010-04-11,5,"Exactly the recipe I needed! This makes 3 thick layers so I often bake mine as 6 layers instead. This goes great with any icing or filling. I even used it to make a Tiramisu cake. Updated to mention that I have been using this recipe to make wedding cakes, it's a great basic recipe that goes well with all kinds of fillings and icings."
204024,111072,2011-08-26,5,Great recipe.  Made for I recommend.
2001857972,111072,2018-01-06,4,Wow!! IT’s really nice and really best birthday cake. You really did awesomely. http://cake-delivery.in/ahmedabad
42062,30399,2002-06-12,5,"A true ""budget strecher"" comfort food! My roommates gave me gave it a two-thumbs-up not only because they were yummy but also it cost us about a loonie each! This is sure going to be a dinner staple from now on."
57475,30399,2002-11-21,5,"Ohhhh, this recipe is excellent. It is so simple to assemble and is so tasty. Next time I prepare this, I will double the recipe for my family. I didn't slice the potatoes as instructed. I just used my paring knife and sliced small pieces off the potato. I sauteed the onion first as I have a better chance of my kids eating the onions. I was not sure that the onions would cook ""soft enough"" if I followed the instructions but with a 450 oven  they probably would have. I hope you try this recipe.    "
30298,30399,2003-01-07,4,Easy and tasty.  I followed it exactly.
98761,30399,2003-08-14,5,"These were very good.  I followed the instructions exactly, but they were not done.  I gave them an extra 15 minutes or so and still not quite done.  My husband loved them anyway.  My tooth just broke in half while I was eating them, no fault of the recipe, so I didn't get to finish mine, but they were very good.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!"

55905,39642,2002-09-24,4,"I just finished eating this, and I must say it is really good. My hubby really loved it..

Don't really agree with the ""one pot"" unless you are going to grate your potatoes, and cheese directly into the skillet..or chop the onions in your hands..LOL

I will make this again! Orchidga"
51292,39642,2002-10-18,5,"I really liked this recipe. My husband made it for me for our first wedding anniversary today.  I could hardly contain myself as I waited for him to finish making it. He said ""5 stars"" and I couldn't agree more. YUMMY!"
24386,39642,2003-06-16,4,"Made this today and it is very good tasting and easy to put together.  I felt that it is not too visually appealing, though.  Perhaps the same ingredients could be made into an omelet to solve that problem."
1365025,39642,2013-02-24,3,"I cheated and used frozen shredded hash browns. It was good but I still think I prefer my potatoes, bacon and eggs separate."
1023207,312259,2008-11-11,3,Too Buttery/Oily but moist!
220348,312259,2009-04-05,5,"This was awesome. I used a chocolate cake mix, but I couldn't find any cake mixes with the pudding mix that I liked so I just used plain ole chocolate mix. I did find them a bit on the oily side, but it was still nice and chewy."
571428,312259,2009-05-09,5,"This is my favourite cookie recipe EVER! I just add chocolate chips and they are the most moist, chewy, delicious chocolate chip cookies ever. Also, I usually use Betty Crocker Super Moist White Cake Mix. However, I also like to experiment and try different flavour cake mixes (chocolate, yellow) and different mix-ins (like mini-reese's cups)."
24386,73243,2003-12-27,5,This was the perfect potato side dish to go with our prime rib Christmas dinner.  We kept them warm in a crockpot which worked out great.  Even better as leftovers! Thanks for posting this fabulous recipe!
187202,285509,2008-11-28,5,"I made this for my brother-in-law's suprise party and EVERYONE RAVED over it!  It was easy and DELISH!  However, next time I will remember to wrap the pan in foil!!! Thanks for a great and easy app!!!"
585449,285509,2009-07-01,5,These are WONDERFUL and so impressive looking!! I make these all the time for parties. I agree with you ramartin42...God Bless Sandra Lee!!

192581,309797,2008-06-18,5,"When I finished making this recipe, I was not sure whether it was a soup or a stew.  I've made both avgolemono soups and stews, and initially I thought this was going to be soupy but it turned out more stewy.  I never thought to put artichokes in avgolemono, but I must say it worked.  I also liked the dill seasoning, but the instructions didn't say when to add it.  I just sprinkled it on top in the end.  Also, I didn't add any cornstarch at all and this still turned out sufficiently thick.  That may have been because I cooked this long enough to make sure the egg was set.  I reduced the olive oil to 1 tablespoon, which may also have affected the thickness.  My only problem with this was the size of the vegetables.  I cut them quite a bit smaller than the recipe recommends.  As a result, you could cut back on the simmer time.  I also cheated and used canned artichoke bottoms, which I added to the soup toward the end:)  BF and I both liked this very much as is though.  Looking forward to eating lefovers for lunch:)"
222564,309797,2013-04-21,4,"Excellent avgolemono (egg and lemon) sauce and the recipe seems very authentic Greek. It turned out so smooth and creamy, not watery or soupy at all. I just loved it with the artichokes and there is excellent instructions of how to prep. the chokes. Not so sure of the potatoes and carrots, though, might just do plain artichokes next time. I did use chicken stock rather than water, gives more savory in my opinion."
428885,217025,2008-08-23,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for, DiB's! I wanted a little spread to put on a tortilla, that got topped off with green onion, bacon, tomato, and some sliced avocado. Perfect! So easy to put together, and the only addition I had was: 1) Use low fat mayo  2) added some garlic powder & 2 drops of Tabasco. Also a great recipe as you can easily halve this, since I only had one extra avocado to use. Now the farm can sleep easy with full & healthful stomaches and the end of a perfect day. Thanks so much, DiB's!"
89881,47804,2003-06-14,5,"Thanks for sharing WJKING!
My Dad always made this for us growing up but I never had an EXACT recipe!
Thanks for the tip!"
356062,194174,2007-04-21,5,"Perfect honey mustard spread/dip. Just the perfect for the hamburgers I made tonight. I normally dont add mayo when I make honey mustard, but it gave it a lift I think. This will be my new go to for honey mustard. Made for PAC 2007."
82568,194174,2008-04-04,4,I made this as per the recipe and felt the honey overpowered the other ingredients.  I used clover honey the first time. So I made a half recipe and only used 1/4 cup honey. This time I used Orange Blossom Honey. Using a lighter honey and less of it really balanced out well with the other flavors. I brushed the new rendi-tion on some smoked pork chops and cooked them on the grill. They were delish! Will use this again using less honey and going to try it on grilled hambrugers.
311203,194174,2009-02-02,5,This is a really good and easy recipe for honey mustard.  Thanks!
2001516959,231910,2017-05-01,5,My wife and I are on a eating health kick (not a diet) and needed a little sweet kicker. This was perfect split a banana with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. We baked for 10 minutes we wouldn't want to go much more as the banana got mushy enough.
482812,231910,2007-06-07,5,I think I'm addicted to this!  I've made it twice in the past two days - once I made it with honey and cinnamon and served it with a little whipped cream and then I made it again with cinnamon and dulce de leche (which is like caramel for anyone not lucky enough to have experienced it!) and again with whipped cream.  I think I made some chopped nuts next time too.  I baked it at 400F for 15 minutes and it came out perfect!  Its very filling and satisfies any sweet cravings you may have while still being healthy - thanks for posting!
227652,231910,2007-06-09,4,yummy & easy!
46211,231910,2007-06-25,5,This was wonderful.  I had it for breakfast and plan on adding it to my oatmeal next time.  I too baked it at 400F for 15 minutes and it was perfect.  My children loved helping out in making it also.  Thanks for sharing.
537188,231910,2007-09-21,5,this is just soooo nice...admittedly i did put a bit too much honey in so it leeked out all over the oven but it was worth it!!!
317197,231910,2008-02-07,5,"Delicious!  I had an overripe banana sitting around and was hopeful it could be saved, and this recipe did it.  I put the parcel on an oven try and I'm glad I did as somehow the honey managed to leak out and would have made a huge mess of the oven.  I sprinkled a couple of dark chocolate chips on top when it came out of the oven and had it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I'll definitely be getting some more bananas to have this again, thanks Wendy-Bob :)"
512309,231910,2008-04-08,5,"Warm, soothing, delicious and so easy!  
Based on other reviewers' problems with leaks, I cooked mine in a glass baking dish covered with foil.  Cooked on 425F for about 12 minutes -- divine!
Thanks, Wendy-Bob!"
552613,231910,2008-11-04,5,I just made these up as a snack to enjoy while I wait for election coverage to start.  They were really easy to do and I didn't have any leakage issues but I also used a tray just to make sure it wouldn't be a problem if they did leak.  I made some toast with fat free cream cheese on it and then put the baked bananas on top and that was seriously tasty without having to break the diet too much.  Made for Please Review tag.
791416,231910,2009-02-25,5,"Finally I found this recipe again! I had lost it, though I kept making it out of memory! Super simple, delicous, and healthy recipe! Thanks!"
421511,231910,2009-03-03,4,"These were pretty good.  I baked for 15 minutes and thought they were a bit too soft for me, so I may cook them for 10 minutes next time or lower the temp on the oven.  They create a nice juice, dh thought I added butter to it!  It's really a nice healthy dessert.  Thanks for posting."
1222500,231910,2009-04-05,5,I LOVE FRUIT! and this was amazing!! thank you so much for the recipe. it is so simple yet tasty!
229052,231910,2010-06-16,5,"So easy and so delicious! If you use a small banana it's only 2 WW points, with a large banana it would be 3 WW points.  I had mine plain, my son had his with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I did think it tasted much better a little cooled off than it did piping hot. Oh, and I am so glad someone mentioned putting these on a tray.. mine leaked quite a bit and it would have been a terrible mess in the oven."
829250,231910,2012-05-22,3,These were ok. Simply!!!! But I don't think they were anything really special.
316194,231910,2015-01-23,3,Mine came out pretty good. Flavor was ok but bananas were mush.
1803712418,231910,2015-01-27,0,I loved this BUT my banana&#039;s turned black during cooking. What do you think could have caused this? Not that it bothered ME but I wouldn&#039;t serve it that way to family or friends. Ripeness of bananas?
2000431901,231910,2016-06-17,4,"Reading the recipe, I assumed I was supposed to peel the banana so I could slice it. Then I just spread it out on a baking tray and baked it for the called for 15 minutes. I liked it okay. I think it would be good with ice cream. It was nice baking it without the peel so I could have a pretty yellow peel to photograph it on though!"
1800278108,231910,2016-09-12,5,"I might just have to try this recipe. Bananas cooked any way is yummy. We mash them up and add to pancake batter. I've even mashed them up and put into plastic container bringing it to a Waffle restaurant and smearing on my waffle. I'm thinking about baking over ripe bananas by themselves. I have trouble finding over ripe or even ripe bananas in the stores. I do buy them still unripe and have them sit, but I get anxious to eat one of my favorite fruits, fattening but healthy."
580725,231910,2018-04-02,1,"When you say gather up the corners to make a little packet, you should make it clear that the packets should not be completely closed. I had nothing but a wet mess. Absolutely no carmelization! Bananas thrown into trash once again only nastier this time. I am assuming that was my mistake - sealing the &quot;packet&quot;?"
2002150109,231910,2018-05-12,0,Yum!!!! Definitely making this again. I added a little extra honey and voila
2002298714,231910,2018-10-12,0,I have lots of bannnanas and I don't know what do to with them and nobody likes banana cream pie
1256549,243034,2009-10-06,4,"I saw this recipe in our electric company's flyer, and loved it...but I lost the recipe when I moved. It's so simple and I always have these ingredients. Tastes a little like bread pudding, or ""peachless"" peach cobbler. You can actually substitute a little peach juice from a can of peaches for some of the milk, or use coconut milk for a different flavor! Yummmy! Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
285868,98366,2006-08-29,5,I tried it and loved it!  I never thought making jam was so easy.  I also added half a stick of cinnamon for that little something extra.
250795,98366,2007-08-08,5,Very simple to make with very simple ingredients!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)
687035,98366,2008-06-11,5,"What a delicious recipe and soooo easy. I only had 6 cups of apricots, so I tinkered with the ingredient amounts and ended up with 3 pint jars. Had to stir every 3 mins or so towards the end of cooking.

Very simple recipe... Canning the stuff was the hardest part! Thanks, incdeb."
859301,98366,2008-06-12,5,"I made this yesterday.  It was delicious.  I may have cooked it a little too much because it's more of a spread; it's really thick.  However, it tastes like candy and is really good on toast."
332566,98366,2008-07-11,5,Made my 2nd batch - delicious!  I watched the temp and brought it to 240 degrees.  I also added 1/2 tablespoon of butter to keep it from foaming (great trick I learned  from recipe 62194!).  Turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!
878178,98366,2008-07-17,5,This is such an easy recipe to follow and the end result is fabulous. I made ALOT as had 2 full tree's worth of apricots to use. Trouble was I gave a couple of jars to friends .... who came back begging for more ... and its all gone now!
871928,98366,2008-12-01,0,Thanks for this wonderful recipe. I just made it from some apricots that  I froze this last summer. It worked great and I love that I didn't use packaged pectin.
1362620,98366,2009-09-03,5,was very good and easy jam to make. It sets up more once I put it in the fridge. I would give this recipe to my freinds and family. Thank you
1629427,98366,2010-06-07,5,"We just had our first crop of apricots in YEARS so I couldn't afford to bungle the jam.  I took a risk and added two large diced jalapenos to the fruit! Made it come alive!!  Easy, easy!!"
1630839,98366,2010-06-18,5,"I have made 2 extra large recipes of this and each time it has been WAY better than ANYTHING store-bought!
Thanks so much for sharing this.
Came out to about 90 cents per half-pint--pretty good savings, if
you think about that we will go through over 2 dozen half-pints in six months! Also, non genetically modified since it is without that nasty corn syrup made with toxic gmo corn. 
We are a non-gmo household and my reason for making our own jams is that all the ones in the store, except the very expensive european imports (genetically modified produce is illegal there
due to health studies) have alot of genetically modified corn syrup in them. This has really helped!"
1630307,98366,2010-07-06,4,Mine did not set. I have always used pectin and was curious about this recipe. It is a delicious sauce. Had it on waffles the other morning. Yum! Maybe a tad too sweet for my taste.
391318,98366,2010-07-27,5,"Love! Love! Love this recipe! It was so easy. I only made half a batch. I used Black Velvet Apricots which gave this jam a beautiful color. I will try to get a picture posted. I only had two pounds of Apricots & used one cup Splenda and one cup organic sugar. The biggest plus was that it did not require pectin and set wonderfully. I even saved some back this morning to put on my french toast, yummy!<br/>I am so excited about this jam. My daughter doesn't like apricots but she loved this jam. <br/>Oh, and since I cut the recipe down, it did not require as much cooking time. I think I only boiled it for about 20 minutes. I ended up with a perfect texture and got five 4 oz jars plus some extra to used right away. Though I doubt that this will last very long in our house. As I type this review I can hear my jars popping letting me know that they are sealed. Ahhh, music to my ears.<br/>Thank you 'incdeb' for this great and 'so easy' recipe. It is just what I needed."
1352632,98366,2011-06-18,5,"Super easy.  I used 12 medium-sized apricots and lowered the sugar to 5 1/2 cups.  I didn't have any lemon juice, but I had some FruitFresh on hand and mixed 3 tsp in with the sugar.  I didn't need to boil it for 30 minutes - it turned clear and thick in about 15, then I let it go for another 5 just in case.  :)  I don't have a canner, so I heated my clean jars in a 300 degree oven while I was cooking the peaches and took them out one by one when I needed them.  I used a boiling water bath to get them to seal.  I got 4 pint jars plus a little extra for my husband and kids to test out on warm bread.  They all gave it rave reviews, so I think this one is a keeper!"
1947697,98366,2011-07-03,5,"I made this the other night and it set beautifully!  My family and friends gobbled their way through all but 2 jars... definitely will make this again before apricots are out of season.  I cut the sugar back to 5 cups as I had a few less apricots, and I tore the apricots into smaller chunks."
240894,98366,2011-07-04,5,"I made this with only one change- I added a pat of butter while it was boiling like a previous reviewer suggested.  I just got a tiny bit of foam that easily stirred back in so that was worth it.  Tastes great and set up nicely, thanks for a great recipe!"
578731,98366,2011-07-29,5,"this is a fantastic recipe, I had about 9 cups of apricots and put 5 C sugar and a tiny bit more lemon juice than called for. It cooked up great and beautiful, nice and thick and I have 6 1/2 pints. Oh yeah, added 3 chopped habanaros....yum sweet n spicy!!!"
1971438,98366,2011-07-31,1,"If you dare to boil this for 30 minutes, you will end up with apricot cotlets (jellied candies).  I'm SO bummed!  I even watched the temp. to make sure I didn't burn it -  never made it past 220 degrees.  But I decided to follow the directions as I've never made jam without pectin before.  Boiling it for 30 minutes was a big mistake."
759543,98366,2011-08-10,4,"This was my first time making jam, and it went over pretty well. Although I only got 4 pints' worth of jam, which was a bummer. And I was unsure of how small to dice the apricots. Overall, I would have liked a little more direction and tips, but it seemed to go alright and we are super excited to have apricot jam in the house!"
661404,98366,2011-08-12,4,"My Sauce/Jam didn't set, which saddens me slightly, but what'ev's I gave it a shot! Doesn't mean I won't continue trying to make jam without added pectin. Boil longer I suppose?! or stir less?!! I haven't a clue! lol! If anyone has any tips on how to tell when it's ready to be jarred, that would be helpful! I tried the freezer thing, no lo se.  Happy Canning Y'all!!! XD"
1545806,98366,2012-06-25,5,"I had great success with this recipe.  I scaled it down to 6.5 cups of fruit and did a mix of apricots and pineapples, about 5 cups of the apricots and 1.5 of the pineapple.  I also added the butter as suggested when boiling.  I am so pleased with the outcome.  On my gas range I boiled for about 25 minutes at just past the med point.  I just made 7 pints and can't wait to make more!"
2313907,98366,2012-07-02,5,This is an excellent and easy to follow recipe.  I added two extra cups of apricot to make it thicker.  Then i followed the rest of the instruction. I love it my first time making this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
2335263,98366,2012-07-19,5,"I always prefer recipies without store bought pectin! This is a great one. Very easy. I, like others, did not boil it for 30 minutes....more like 15. I used the spoon test to check for readiness - dip a teaspoon in and if it jells as it is dripping off the spoon and cooling, then it is ready! This will go fast at my house!"
2365096,98366,2012-08-15,4,I cooked it and cooked it trying to get it up to the 240 deg. as mentioned in someone elses comment and it would never get that hot. I ended up bottling it at about 220 deg and only got 3.5 12 oz jars filled. It's also a darker orange color.
2858122,98366,2013-06-10,5,"Made 2 batches last night.  I also added a 1/2 Tbls of butter to cut the foam.  I got 4 pint jars from each batch.  If u want better luck for it to gel and set, use smaller jars (quicker cooling time).  I also could only get mine up to 220 degree mark.  We will see if it sets it looks a lil runny this morning."
1751447,98366,2013-12-12,5,Very good recipe.
2231457,98366,2014-05-06,0,"I&#039;d never made jam before. As I now leave in South Africa and it&#039;s popular to make homemade jams, jellies, and other canned goods. I really wanted to give it a try. It was very easy to make. I got lots of compliments from my new friends. I also took some home to the U.S. for friends and family, and it went over like gang busters. It&#039;s expensive to buy jam jars here. So my local friends, showed me you can recycle jars. You can put the clean jars in microwave for 1 min per jar (3 jars 3 mins etc). When you take them out they are hot of course. Fill with the hot jam leave half inch space. Put the top on make sure is good and tight, flip them upside down on a towel to cool overnight. These will keep the seal, your jam will keep no problem. This recipe encouraged me to try to experantment with other fruits. I can&#039;t wait!!"
10097736,98366,2014-05-19,5,"I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly.  When i stopped cooking it I was afraid it might not be thick enough so it seemed a little thin after 25 minutes but it set up fine.  The amount of sugar was right for my taste, It&#039;s a little tart, not too sweet."
1800139325,98366,2014-05-25,5,"I make a lot of jam and this is a good recipe but a tad sweet. I made a second batch, and since apricot is my wife&#039;s favorite, I made a large batch which used 26 cups, (44 apricots), 3/4 cups lemon juice and reduced the sugar from 20 to 16 cups and added 3 Tbs. butter. Butter virtually eliminates the foam.  Because I was using less sugar I increased the cooking time to 45 minutes and it came out perfect. This made 26 1/2 pints, enough to keep my wife well stocked and plenty to share with friends and family. Bon Appetit."
1802843633,98366,2014-06-21,5,This was my first attempt at Apricot Jam. Love it. Used my candy thermometer; brought it up to 220
1802845925,98366,2014-06-23,5,"Great, simple recipe for a pectin-free jam. I added a dash of cinnamon, a pat of butter (to decrease foaming) and I decreased the cook time to 15 minutes."
99217,98366,2014-06-25,0,"Fantastic recipe! Came out perfectly! For those whose didn&#039;t set, there are two possible reasons. 1- You didn&#039;t cook it long enough, or 2- your fruit was over-ripe. It&#039;s always important to have some under-ripe fruit in your jam, as it has more natural pectin in it. (I like to dice it more finely than the ripe fruit.)"
1802972187,98366,2014-07-28,5,"Wow. Thank God. My husband picked fresh Apricots in our yard and tried this recipe, oh really it&#039;s a keeper. This is my first time in my entire life to make an Apricot Jam and it&#039;s a big success. Will make it again. I made 10 cups of apricot and added 1Tbsp. butter. Tip: please don&#039;t use over ripe Apricot."
400708,98366,2014-08-09,5,With an over abundance of fresh apricots I made 2 batches of this (and it makes a lot) one as directed and then a 2nd with a large jalapeno pepper added.  I did at 1 tablespoon of butter to reduce the foaming.  Other than that followed as directed and couldn&#039;t be happier.  Sure have a LOT of apricot jam to last me all year.  Thanks for posting
209425,98366,2016-08-07,0,"This worked like magic, BUT problem.... I followed directions exactly, but the bottom of the pot burned, not exactly burned, but the sugar turned dark candied colour.....so the jam is very dark in colour, which is ok, but I'd have preferred it paler. Also, I did half the recipe and it only made 1 pint jar and a bit in the other.....I'm wondering where I went wrong :("
2001286803,98366,2016-12-07,5,"First time jammer... this turned out great, with wonderful taste! I used apricots out of the freezer, diced while they were still firm. Measured my ingredients exact to the recipe. I'd read most of the reviews, and was concerned about it not setting up and getting the temperature to 220. So... I simmered it slowly up to 220 and gelling off the spoon- which took about 30min. Out of the cupboard the consistency was perfect, but thickened more than I wanted it to out of the refrigerator. Hoping to fix that by adjusting my cooking time to 20 minutes, but other than that I won't change a thing. Taste is oooo so good!!"
2001561445,98366,2017-05-30,5,"I made the jam this morning and the hardest part was de-stoning and chopping the apricots. I am not used to using the US method of cups, but I bought some recently and they worked fine. The jam is fairly dark and it looks as though it has set. I am hopeless at making jam - it NEVER sets, and I have been known to put gelatine in to make it jam like. I put the thermometer in and no matter that I put the jam pan on my highest burner, I could not get the temperature up to 220. The best I could do after 30m minutes was about 214 degrees. I am pleased with the results and look forward to munching my way through lots of toast and jam!"
2001576855,98366,2017-06-09,5,Well my 10 year old and I made this recipe today. Our first time canning anything so I'm still hoping it sets and seals properly. We doubled the recipe and it took 32 minutes of boiling. We otherwise followed the directions but decreased sugar by two cups overall. Tastes delicious. We used 12 4oz jars and 12 8oz jars. We're super excited and have our fingers crossed that we hear jars start popping. Oh and we also added butter and foam was minimal
2001601318,98366,2017-06-26,5,"Turned out great!! I used a stick blender to pulverize the skins....I think it adds to its texture and taste. I was using apricots that come ripe in our area around the end of June. These type are usually for eating and lack that tartness that I love.....But they were from my brother's tree so that made them extra special. First batch I doubled the lemon juice to 1/2 cup...They were good but the second batch I added 3/4 cup of lemon juice and that is the BEST!! Also, a pinch of pink salt. These were pretty juicy apricots plus with the extra juice, I cooked after bringing to a good boil for 35 minutes. I also added ingredient to keep jam from turning brown, it is sodium ascorbate vitamin C. It is a powder you can get on line from health food stores. It has no acid in it and doesn't change taste!! I love the stuff to preserve freshness!!"
2001604099,98366,2017-06-28,0,Can this recipe be halved - I am only have a pound of apricots and wanted to try out this LEAP recipe.
2001657417,98366,2017-08-04,0,I made this for the first time today - couldn't have been easier but it ended up being a dark carmel color. Doesn't look like apricots at all. Did that happen to anyone else? I followed the directions to the letter.
2001801010,98366,2017-12-30,0,"Hi and thank you for the simple to follow recipe! I actually quadrupled the recipe ( minus 2 cups of sugar) and turned out marvellous! ...now that I've picked heaps more apricits off our young tree, I wish to make similar jam but with a bit of &quot;spicyness&quot;....any suggestions? Thanks again!"
2000343155,98366,2018-07-30,5,Absolutely delicious
6357,29916,2002-10-11,5,"Banana, milk and honey lovers are in for a treat!
I have this sometimes in the afternoons, for a very quick lunch, that's when I skip breakfast:-)
This is filling and good."
104295,29916,2004-06-08,5,"This is excellent.  I used skim milk and a frozen banana (I didn't have any that were not frozen).  With skim milk it is 5 WW points for the whole thing.  I split it with my 2 year old DD and counted it as 3.  It was a great fast brekafast as I put my makeup on and got ready to go.  So I didn't follow the going to bed part of it, but it sure was yummy and fast.  Thanks!"
64203,29916,2005-02-26,5,"I just made this for a quick afternoon treat and it was delicious! I used a ripe banana, but I think next time I'll use a frozen banana to add a little thickness to the shake. This was such a delicious drink! I'll be making this again!"
71029,29916,2005-02-27,4,"Freezing the banana does have make the shake ""sleep-inducing"" because your body starts to use energy to warm up after you drink it.  Very healthy and filling with skim or soy milk!   I add a little cardamom and nutmeg, sweet dreams!"
189616,29916,2005-03-10,5,"Thanks Kim D. my husband and boys really enjoyed it, I put the bananas in the freezer for an hour or so, and it blended perfectly smooth and creamy. Unfortunately though it didn't work--my boys were still bouncing off the walls-FOR THAT YOU GET 2!!!!Just kidding, keep posting more goodies."
160974,29916,2005-03-11,5,"I have been making ""banana milk"" for years, and have always found it really comforting. I saw that you put honey in  your recipe, so I thought I'd try it. It did add a nice flavor dimension to it. I always add some grated nutmeg on top. If only my daughter (who has a difficult time falling asleep) liked banana flavor!

43083,29916,2005-08-10,5,I cant believe I have never seen this recipe before! I had a ripe banana that needed to be used so I made this for a quick breakfast. Added 2 ice cubes but that is it. Thanks for a simple but yummy drink that I will make again:)
1397394,29916,2009-09-27,5,"This is my new favorite recipe!  It's so refreshing and the ingredients are perfectly balanced.  I also added 2 ice cubes and I use frozen bananas instead.  It definitely makes me feel relaxed, thank you!"
441981,275540,2009-11-17,5,"Yummy! I added about 1 1/2 cups vanilla ice cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 cup milk. I also used more a little more banana and topped it with whipped cream."
28636,316766,2009-01-26,5,"An avocado lover's dream dressing!  We had some avocados that were becoming overly ripe so I am so very glad I found this recipe.  It was so very rich and creamy, and the flavors were wonderful.  Because it was so thick, I served it over a very sturdy lettuce - iceberg - and diced tomatoes.  Yum!!  Dh loved it too.  I'll bet this would be great over citrus sections and I'll have to try it with pasta as you suggested.  I'll keep this one handy. Thanks grocery girl!"
486725,316766,2010-03-11,5,"I can see why this made it into a best of 2009 cookbook. Super creamy and delicious. It was great on salad and as a dip for baked french fries and crudite. I used low fat buttermilk, nonfat sour cream, green onions and half the salt. I don't think having it over pasta would be my thing, but I could see a lot of other applications for it. It is super!"
1725722,316766,2011-06-07,5,"I made this for Guadalupe House on 6/7/11 and it got great reviews! I made a big salad with spinach, Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, celery and onion."
59064,31540,2004-02-09,5,Nice reliable way of making a good white sauce without getting lumps.
245642,31540,2005-09-23,5,thanks you for this simple recipe.
8688,31540,2005-11-24,5,"Braunda, You saved the day on Thanksgiving this year!  I had misplaced my usual recipe for White Sauce, looked it up on Zaar and your recipe popped up!  It is exactly what I use every year to make my peas and mushrooms in cream sauce.  Thanks so much for making my Thanksgiving dinner a success, Braunda!"
158893,31540,2008-01-27,5,"So simple, and so yummy!  My hubby and kids love when I use this roux for our pasta...I usually add ground turkey and spinach for an easy pasta night!  Thanks!"
944149,31540,2008-09-08,5,Thank you alot u have save my day!!!
349819,31540,2008-09-18,5,Quick & Easy. Superb!
360030,31540,2009-11-27,5,"This is the same recipe I always use over leftover stuffing and turkey.  Since I am at my moms for thanksgiving I didn't have my usual recipe at hand, so this was a good reminder of ingredient amounts!  Thanks for posting!"
4740,31540,2010-12-18,5,Good basic white sauce.  Good for in a pinch when I ran out of cream of chicken soup.
1803226673,31540,2014-10-13,5,"This is a literal life saver. I was starting to get frantic trying to figure out what to serve my kids (ages 16 months, 2.5 years, and 4 years) for lunch. I knew about roux based sauces but I didn&#039;t know it could be a sauce by itself. I am a continuously learning home chef, and love how quick and easy this was."
58104,174216,2006-09-15,5,This was a very fruity drink good as is but a touch of seltzer would have been great! I garnished with frozen cranberries. Fresh grapefruit is $2.00 each! 
88099,174216,2006-10-24,5,Oh these were very nice and very fruity.  Sis and I had these last night and we both enjoyed.  Thanks Evelyn
486725,174216,2010-07-05,4,Very good juice cocktail. It is nice to add a little sparkling water to it to make it like a spritzer. Add some peach schnapps if you want to make it adult!
194114,84709,2008-02-23,5,"My Appms turned out just very nice. Thank you very much. I served this with chicken korma, the combined flavor was out of this world."
169430,482431,2012-08-26,5,It's Sunday and the store is closed so I borrowed some great Gala apples from the neighbor and made this wonderful recipe this morning. The spice is exquisite with the sweet juicy apples. Thee will be repeats as we just love crisp's in this house. It bakes up beautifully and isn't at all difficult to do. :D
242766,482431,2012-09-03,5,"Delicious!  We loved this quick and easy apple crumble.  The tea masala spices added a wonderful flavor.  I used your recipe #448067 #448067 recipe for the spices and it worked perfectly.  I ended up adding 3 teaspoons of the chai spices to the crumble mix, and an additional 3 teaspoons was sprinkled over the apples before adding the crumble topping.  I used Gala apples and baked it for about 45 minutes in a 9x13"" baking pan.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!<br/>**Made for ZWT 8 Zingo Round**"
679953,482431,2012-09-23,5,"Great dessert.  Took this dessert to my neighbors for poker night. All of us craved over this.  did use your recpe#448067#448067, with a tablespoon of this, and longth some tea mae fo a very nice treat.  As the others I used gala apples with this. I also used butter instead of margarine.  Made recipe right down the line.  Flavors a 10.  Seeing that the weather is up and down here , cant wait to use the tea spice again, as apple picking season is just starting here in Indiana.  Made for PRMR tag."
895132,482431,2012-12-06,5,"Yum! I admit that I increased the spices, using your recipe #448067 like Bayhill. Also I used gluten free flour and gluten free rolled oats. Absolutely wonderful and comforting on a cool first of December. Thanks for sharing!<br/>Made for Make My Recipe Reunion Tag Game AUS/NZ Forum"
1925885,482431,2013-05-18,5,"Yummy!  Like other reviewers, I made your Recipe#448067 to use in this delicious crumble!  I only made half the recipe, which was perfect since there are no leftover &quot;temptations&quot;!  Oh, and used more of the spice than called for (it&#039;s so tasty!!!).  Thanks for posting!"
286566,482431,2013-07-06,5,"Have to say one of the best apple crumble recipes I have had - the only change I made was after a suggestion from the DH was to give the oats a bit of a blitz in the food processor as his big against this type of crumble was the oats being chunky and often being burnt and have to say it worked a treat and even though I scaled this back for 3 serves there was enough for 4 so maybe the DH may taste and change his mind about about apple crumble with oats.  Thank you awalde, made for Aussie/Kiwi Recipe n#78 July 2013."
47892,482431,2014-01-19,5,"Oh, this was gooooood! I used Washington-grown apples and Oregon made butter. The apples were very thinly sliced (my preference). I tested with homemade ras el hanout but next time I will try your spice mix recipe. The crumble was cut down to fit in a 5 1/2&quot; cast iron skillet-plenty for three of us. I topped with freshly whipped cream, too! Pears would be a delicious substitute for the apples or in combination as would nectarines/peaches. Reviewed for Make My Recipe Downunder #84 January 2014. Thank you!"
227652,181141,2006-08-10,0,I'd like to try this but there isn't any wheat germ listed. Could the poster of this recipe please fix this? 
37779,39175,2003-02-10,5,"My husband and I are big fans of tuna melts. We had to give this one a try because it was a little different from our usual. Very delicious. I added some chopped pickles and boiled eggs to the salad. The Swiss cheese gave it a wonderful flavor. Definitely a new twist on an old favorite. Thanks Lennie, for sharing your recipe."
134386,39175,2004-04-29,5,The whole family loved it!  I'm hungry for one right now!
5060,39175,2004-06-05,5,"Excellent tuna melt, I didn't have enough mozzarella so I added some sharp cheddar and I chopped the ends of the tomato and sprinkled them on top just to use them up. Very nice mix, love the red pepper and onion. Also used ultra low fat Miracle Whip. We enjoyed them for brunch and will be making them again, thanks for sharing."
183756,39175,2005-03-12,5,A definite winner and permanent recipe in my book. Thumbs up by my cuisine tasters! ^-~ I lightened it up and added some celery. It was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!
46660,39175,2007-08-01,5,"I was looking for something to do with a bagel for lunch, and I came across this recipe.  I did improvise because I didn't have some of the stuff.  I used pre-chopped shallots in place of the red onion and jarred roasted red peppers in place of fresh.  I also omitted the tomato and used lowfat mayo.  I baked it for about 7 minutes, then broiled for about 3.  I topped each of them with 1/2 slice swiss and 1/2 slice cheddar.  Since it was just me eating, I piled all of the tuna onto two bagel halves.  I will definitely make this again...probably tomorrow!  Thanks!"
4470,39175,2008-09-22,5,Lovely Lunch Thanks Lenny -  I used a whole wheat pita instead of a bagel and didn't have a red pepper.  Still delicious.
37449,515586,2014-05-01,5,This was so easy! I put in blender with almond milk and a little cinnamon and enjoyed as  a midday snack. Thanks! Made for Pick a Chef(PAC) spring 2014.
1803355537,459115,2014-11-16,5,I love this recipe and have been using it for years.
204024,252419,2008-04-08,5,"What can go wrong with this? Easy, quick, classic, and delicious. Suggest using coldest available ice cream for the thickest shake.  Made for PAC April 2008."
199848,153053,2006-02-06,5,"This is a quick and easy dip to prepare.  The longer it sets, the better the flavor!  It is quite lemony, and I only used 1 tbsp lemon juice.  This would make a great sandwich spread in addition to being a dip.  I think I'm going to try this w/ vanilla yogurt; I think that would be great w/ the lemon taste. Thanx for sharing this recipe.  I'll make it again."
58104,86640,2004-07-30,5,"5 stars all the way. Very good! This would also be good on a lettuce and cheese sandwich or a turkey sandwich, or as a base for wraps. In place Of the mayo and garlic salt I used Aoili. "
52448,86640,2005-03-11,5,This was very good! I served it as a dip with cut up pita strips. Used a fresh garlic clove and normal salt.
125388,86640,2009-08-22,5,"Very good appetizer spread.  I served this on crackers with a little bit of shredded lettuce as a garnish on the top.  I was going for a BLT effect which worked quite well and was enjoyed by all.  This spread is best served soon after adding the bacon as directed in the recipe.  I had a little of the spread leftover that I ate the next day.  Still tasted good, but the bacon gets soggy and makes the spread too salty-tasting."
498271,384137,2009-11-03,4,"These pancakes make a great breakfast treat!  I made 1/3 of the recipe and cooked in a little less oil than you specified.  Served rolled up, sprinkled with lemon juice and powdered sugar - yum - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for My 3 Chefs, November 2009"
60575,384137,2011-02-04,5,OMG these are perfect !!!  I live in Holland and just tried this recipe for the first time.  I've eaten a lot of Dutch pancakes and these were the best...  It's only been 4 days and I'm already craving them !  <br/><br/>PERFECT !!!! Thanks Libby.
29196,22224,2005-09-25,4,"I quartered my artichokes. Not anything wrong with this recipe, but I felt fresh artichokes were a lot of work for the final results."
197244,121308,2005-11-07,5,"These are wonderful - full of flavor and easy to make.  I'm not much of a mayo person, so I think next time I will only put 1/2 cup, and I didn't have french bread on hand, so I used thick white bread instead.  Made a few and then froze the rest like suggested - can't wait to have for breakfast or lunch tomorrow!! Thanks!!!"
113108,121308,2005-12-27,5,WOW!!!  Not one left.  First thing devoured.  Even the unbaked toppping was good as a dip for chips.  Five stars is not enough.  Best post I have eaten.
222564,121308,2006-10-22,4,"Over-the-top-yummy! Made as instructed and it was just so scrumptious. In fact, there seems to be so much mayo in these, that it can either be reduced or something else added in. Like mushrooms fried up crunchy with the bacon? Just an idea."
311260,121308,2007-03-25,4,I made these to take to my mother in Law's birthday.  Everyons loved them.  They are full of flavour and very good.  I could have eaten 10 myself... but of course I didn't..I did use 2/3 cheddar & 1/3 gruyre as I ran out of cheddar.  Excellent recipe!!
298801,121308,2007-09-13,5,"This is exactly what my mom used as appi's during the holidays but she had lost the recipe, now I have it!! Thanks for the memories brought back when I had the first bite!!! This is a definite keeper!"
58439,121308,2007-09-15,4,"OH BOY did I enjoy! TRUE!
SO healthy AND filling too!
Made on pide, added sauteed red onion finely diced!
To me was VERY nice!
Lessened mayo like others did review!
Added 1/2 crushed pineapple too!
LOVE the crunch and the munch!
These are GREAT for brekkie or lunch!"
374506,121308,2008-10-06,2,Halfed the recipe and glad I did they were just OK.  Nothing like I thought they would be.  Doubt if I make them again
56003,121308,2008-12-14,5,"Mmmmmmm, good!  Used the food processor to mix all, as I was in a hurry.  I think I will do that the next time we have these, too.  So easy!  Followed recipe ingredients exactly.  Will not have to change a thing.  These went extremely well with Nicole's Creamy Tomato Soup.  Great combo.  Thnx for posting, *Pamela*!"
60486,121308,2009-05-28,4,"Love these as an evening snack. Omitted the onion and subbed precooked bacon pieces. Toasted the almonds. Been making something similar to this for years, and the idea of adding almonds and worcestershire sauce intrigued me."
21752,12361,2002-09-15,4,"Great dish!  Black beans are not available locally, so I used canned kidney beans.  With a mild salsa everyone in the family enjoyed this as a side dish."
4439,12361,2004-04-28,4,I can't believe other people haven't reviewed this good and easy and healthy recipe. This is good!!!!
64539,12361,2004-09-11,5,Excellent recipe. I didn't have any salsa or tomato juice in the house so I put in some chopped tomatoes from my garden and a dash of salt and pepper. It was still excellent(:
264198,12361,2005-11-19,5,"This dish was GREAT, and super easy to prepare.  I doubled the recipe because I was feeding six people, but it would have been fine with just one batch.  Also the leftovers were tasty too!  Excellent side dish!"
185285,12361,2006-08-21,5,"This was my selection for DH's first Heart-Happy meal.  I served it with Omega-3 enriched whole wheat tortillas and a glass of Syrah. Quote: ""This diet might not be so bad after all"".  Thanks Tebo... we are off to a great start in our house!"
293410,12361,2007-02-20,5,"A definite keeper! So thick and satisfying, with a wonderful flavor. I used basmati rice, home-cooked beans,a little extra oregano and cumin and added 1/2c. water. I LOVE how this could be thrown together and tossed in the oven in 5 minutes! Served it with lots of salad. Thanks Tebo!"
315084,12361,2008-09-01,5,This dish is soooo good. It is very easy to assemble and quick also. Put in oven and come back in an hour and quarter and ready to eat. I followed recipe as directed with the exception of adding an additional 1/2 cup water. I also sprayed casserole dish with cooking spray felt this was a good idea no scrubbing dish afterwards. this one has been added to the list of regularly prepared dishes in this house.
275207,12361,2009-09-09,5,"Very easy to make, and it's delicious! Unfortunately, I forgot to add the corn in this batch but you can bet I will remember on future attempts with this recipe. The meal itself is very filling and satisfying - though I'm tempted to add more/different beans. Will definitely be making this one again."
1894476,341274,2011-04-25,5,"I have made over 10 of theese since Christmas. They (for the most part) have all turned out GREAT!!! I would even say I like this recipe even better than outbacks recipe!<br/><br/>One little tip though, cheesecake Is verry dense. So after almost whiping the eggs til there all froth, only mix the rest of the ingredents as much as you absolutly have to. Mixing too much will cause air to get traped inside so the cake will rise then fall creating ugly cracks on the top."
803770,201097,2008-03-31,5,"It's an omlette. What can go wrong?

If you do mess up, remember that you can always scramble whatever you have and add you filling. Meatloaf in Scrambled Eggs isn't bad. I haven't ate eggs in 10 years, and I made an omlette, messed it up, and had the best scrambled eggs I've ever eaten."
2001970443,533981,2018-02-03,4,"Added ice to thin it out a bit, the flavors were a bit too strong for me as is."
461834,228709,2007-05-25,5,"Very tasty dressing!!!  I made it and let it sit in the frigerator for about two days, then had it with a salad today for lunch.  I did add more salt and some pepper once I tasted it, but the dressing flavor was yummy."
59064,228709,2008-01-26,5,Very nice dressing with ingredients that are readily available.
61569,228709,2008-10-21,5,So simple and so good - basil fresh from my garden in October. I also like to toss some basil leaves with other salad greens for a double impact.  Thank you Diana for posting this wonderful recipe.
284897,228709,2009-09-17,5,"So easy and used ingredients which are usulally on hand in my pantry. I did use dried basil though, as fresh is not yet fully in season, but cant wait to try this with fresh basil.
Easy, quick tasty and this dressing really improved the salad I served for dinner.
Thanks Fiana, will be making this again and its nice to know the ingredients will be on hand!"
68960,228709,2009-12-31,5,Great dressing! I gave this a good 24 hours in the fridge and the flavours came together beautifully.  Used some lemon basil I have growing in the garden.
80353,40114,2004-10-04,4,"Very nice.  A simple and tasty side.  The potatoes were rich and creamy.  My only problem was that the recipe doesn't specify what size dice and I obviously cut the dice too large, in about 1/2-inch pieces, it took far longer that 20 minutes to soften up and then a good 45 minutes in the oven to finish cooking, so I suggest you cut your potatoes in smaller dice.  One other change, we are garlic lovers, so I left out the grated onion (didn't want to start grating an onion only for 1 tsp) and I used one minced garlic clove instead.  It was a great substitution as the finished sauce almost had a garlicky 'Alfredo' taste to it.  This is a recipe that I think will lend itself very well to a lot of experimentation, and I can't wait to try it with other cheeses.  I am already thinking of doing this again with creamy Gorgonzola!"
36944,40114,2006-06-27,4,"This was a very tasty dish that took little effort and uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I omitted the butter, added 1 clove of garlic and some minced onion.  I must have diced my potatoes about the right size (see photo) because the cook time was  accurate for me.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Marie!"
197023,40270,2006-06-10,5,"Easy to make and wonderfully delicious. Tasted SO like the Apfel Kuchen I remember my grandmother making!  Thank you, Charlotte - and Mrs. S. Hiller, for this recipe!  Made for the 2006 ZWT  Germany/Benelux Dessert Challenge!"
792697,183563,2009-04-11,5,"This recipe is perfect.  My husband is Japanese and we eat this often in Japan.  I wanted to make it for us when we are home in the USA.  I followed the directions almost exactly, except I didn't cut the tofu into triangles and I didn't fry it the second time, because it was a beautiful color from the start.  Rinsing in the boiling water until it is soft is the ket to making it taste authentic.  It's not crispy after that, and it's not supposed to be!  Thanks for posting the recipe!  Arigato!"
2138865,370125,2012-01-08,5,"Having had lots of holidays in MENORCA - I have made this recipe lots of times, I usually add the rind of a lemon. I find it may take 45 minutes to cook  and I use round loose bottom tin. Served cream or Almond ice cream and a few rapberries if you have them-it's a winner everytime!"
4470,182806,2007-07-13,4,This is a 5star for flavor however your instructions are a bit unclear - how do you cut your  frankfurters so they curl? I suspect lengthwise but this was not stated.Also I think that the amount of beans is a bit skimpy for 4.I loved the sweet onions on top along with the tomatoes.   I used  whole grain bread slices instead of a burger bun-  Truly enjoyed - thanks meedeeter for an enjoyable mid week dinner
133987,86691,2004-03-20,5,"This was VERY easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand , which I love. Never have to buy anything ""special"" .

Mine puffed up kind of lopsided, but it didn't affect the taste in any way. I think the reviewer above should have used the powdered sugar as stated in the recipe. It definitely tastes blah without it!

I love the way the powdered sugar melts into the melted buttery top of this. Great nighttime snack ;-) "
134027,86691,2004-03-20,5,yummy! VERY easy to make... almost impossible to screw up :) awesome how it puffs up. and it's all about the powdered sugar on top :)
132886,86691,2004-03-21,2,"Okay, maybe I did something really wrong (I don't know how, but its possible). Anyway, I mixed the ingredients and melted the butter in the pan in the oven. (This may have been wrong. Pan too hot?) I poured the mixture in and set the timer for 15 minutes. I checked it with 4 minutes to go and saw a big 'souffle'. Okay, maybe that will go down once removed from heat. Noooo. And it didn't taste so good either. But I didn't add the powdered sugar, so that would definitely improve the taste. So, with respect to Marlene this recipe did not work for me. It would be great if someone else tried it and succeed. I can be really terrible in the kitchen.  ***An update to my original review:  My mother loved it WITHOUT the powdered sugar.  So, different strokes for different folks.  At least I know I made it the right way.  smile
"
124901,86691,2004-04-05,4,"This was very easy to make. Mine puffed up great and deflated in the middle when cooled (which I expected) The kids loved it, I did sprinkle with powdered sugar and served with fresh strawberries and maple syrup. As I said my kids and husband Loved it, I liked it, it was just a bit egg-y (sp) for me. I will make again, however, I may try it with just 1 egg. Thanks "
1634682,86691,2010-07-28,5,I loved this. It was easy and delish. I added a brown sugar mixture to it. 1 cup packed brown sugar with 1 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tbsp water. Sprinkled on when the pancake came out of oven. Added strawberries or bananas or blueberries and oh yum. Thanks for this!
1803190896,86691,2015-12-02,4,"As you said, typically a little bland, but I like to use a mix of lemon juice and powdered sugar to spruce it up. To determine how fluffy it is, is how much you mix/whip it. If you mix it very gently, you get a very flat pancake. If you whip it with a whisk, it&#039;ll inflate like a balloon. This is because the air that you&#039;re adding to the mix will expand when it&#039;s heated."
699555,389950,2009-09-22,5,"This was a big hit when I served it.  Mine turned out a bit too garlicy for my taste, but perhaps my clove was larger.  I added some softened cream cheese to balance the garlic and it was delightful!  Served with fresh vegetables and pita chips."
779699,389950,2009-10-26,5,"This was a predicted addictive. It was a bit tart, but I love tart salty garlic so it was impossible for me to put down. I hate it on triscuts! Mmmmm! Thanks for posting! [Made for Holiday Tag October 2009]"
577585,389950,2009-11-03,5,This was a big hit at my family's reunion. Very easy and tasty.
296656,311714,2012-06-20,0,Great recipe.  Where I'm from we call them chili beans...just add 1 TBSP chili powder or to taste.
479323,220592,2007-04-07,4,Easy to make and delicious!  Try adding some toasted coconut to put this recipe over the top.
209463,181524,2006-08-18,4,This is really good; I did leave out the 1/2 cup of oil as there was enough moisture without it.
58104,76087,2004-08-11,5,"This was fabulous! So creamy sweet. I served it with crackers. Much easier then the brie I top with apricot preserves stuffed in puff pastry. I bought a large wheel, slice it in half then sliced the half lengthwise, put it together to form a circle cut side up. As you see in my picture. This is a must for all to make."
168462,76087,2007-03-18,5,"Awesome appetizer. It is so easy to make that my nine year old can make it himself. He loves to have it for dinner with crackers. When I am out of pecans, I top it with sliced almonds. If you are looking for a super easy appetizer that will be a hit with everyone, this is it. Thanks for the recipe."
28177,327059,2012-09-20,5,"I have to admit that I wasn't sure about the use of sun-dried tomato in deviled eggs, but I feel like I've tried just about every other combination of fillings out there, and I had the tomatoes on hand.  What a surprise!  These eggs have a unique flavor and exciting color that others don't have.  The real test though, is 6-year old DD, who never eats anything but the egg whites.  Tonight she helped make these eggs, and then she actually ate the whole thing.  Several times over!  :)  I had to use dried basil.  Unfortunately, I just threw out what was left of the fresh I had yesterday (was looking a little dark), not realizing I would be able to use it up before it was too late.  I know the flavor will pop even more with fresh basil next time.  Vicky, we will remember you fondly every time we enjoy this recipe.  Made and enjoyed in memory of VickyJ, a very special forum host."
47892,327059,2012-09-29,5,"I used fresh basil and green onions from our CSA; local eggs! Super easy! We cook<br/>our hard boiled eggs the same way, too! Reviewed for VickyJ's Cookathon. Rest in peace, Vicky J."
30298,6633,2002-03-24,4,"I had an easy time making this cake.  The end result is delicious, although a little too moist. Definitely a great cake to serve with tea."
42822,6633,2002-06-10,4,This is a really good cake. We especially liked the icing on this.
23445,6633,2001-11-25,5,I made this cake the night before Thanksging. It was a hit! It's wonderful with a hot cup of coffee.
111526,6633,2004-09-19,4,This was very moist; we liked the way the icing sunk into the cake making almost a hard crust on the outside; I did add some cinnamon & nutmeg as I thought it might be a bit bland without it. The pecans added a nice crunch as well; good texture; easy to prepare.
52283,6633,2008-10-08,5,"This was a great recipe.  Easy and fast to whip up.  I added a tsp of cinnamon, just cos I really like cinnamon.  It came out great and tastes terrific.  Will probably make this a lot.  Thanks, keep up the good work."
240832,6633,2009-02-01,4,Only reason this wasn't a 5 is because of my DH (he's my expert taster)  It really should have a 4 1/2 - it is soooo easy to make and really tasty.  I did add cinnamon and nutmeg but apparently not enough.  Just needed a little more flavor.  I added 1 cup of raising (DH's request) and omitted the icing - it is wonderful with ice cream or with cool whip on top!  Thanks for a great recipe - we'll be making this again!!
66549,79836,2004-06-10,5,I was out of the usual fajita marinade I buy at the grocery store so turned to zaar and found your recipe.  I won't ever buy it again.  Thanks for sharing.  I used all of your ingredients and also added about 1 T. of liquid smoke.  We like that flavor.  
42615,79836,2005-05-29,5,Very good! Great on chicken or steak.
213003,79836,2005-08-15,5,"My fajita's turned out great with this marinade.  I had left over cooked chicken, so I marinated in this for about an hour, then plopped in on a griddle to warm up.  Threw it in a heated up flour tortilla with onion, green and red pepper, sour cream and shredded cheese - DELICIOUS~"
47570,79836,2006-06-22,5,"My son brought his girlfriend over for dinner last night and I made this, using chicken.  When she called it was gourmet, my heart soared. Me? A gourmet cook?  Thank you.  Excellant."
168282,79836,2006-08-30,5,"Just excellent.  Used recipe as written, marinated steak for a couple of hours.  Really, really good."
263513,79836,2006-12-21,2,"oh. I normally love Dancer^ recipes, however, this one was not what I was looking for. This recipe tasted like a Chinese stir-fry recipe."
731373,79836,2010-04-15,0,"Great!  The 2 adults and 4 children I served it to sucked it down.  Very simple, although I cut down the red wine vinegar and soy sauce to 1/8 cup each.  Marinated for one hour and it was still great!"
307059,79836,2010-04-15,5,Wow! I just had this marinade at my daughters house and it was delicious.  She changed the soy sauce and red wine vinegar to 1/8 of a cup and used a cuisinart instead of a blender.  I will most assuredly try this recipe for myself.  Thanks for sharing.
303700,254325,2007-10-24,5,"Made for Photo Tag Fall 2007.
We lubs them!!
As you you are chewing the last morsel...this tiny Mmmm is murmured and you gotta have just one more.
Thanks Loof!"
185142,254325,2007-11-11,5,"These were fantastic. I made them twice. The first time, the filling was too hard to spread (chunks of sausage). The second time, I put the cream cheese and cooked sausage in my food processor. It was much easier to spread. I also didn't cut the bread in half until I had rolled it up with the filling. I also didn't cook the bacon first. It took 30 minutes with the raw bacon. FANTASTIC!"
337963,254325,2008-01-06,3,Made these for hubby today for watching the football playoffs.  He liked them!  Thanks for posting Loof.  Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders tag game.
88099,254325,2008-12-31,5,"These are great little appetizers and so easy to make. I only made half the recipe for the two of us. I used a nice wheat bread and spiced up the sausage mixture with 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder with green onions and parsley, and a shake or two of crushed red pepper flakes. I had to bake mine about 30 minutes to get the bacon done, but that's my oven for you. Will make these again. Thanks loof. Made for PRMR Tag Game."
174096,254325,2009-11-30,5,"This is a winner!  Delicious and simple.  I added some onion to the filling on a few of them, as we love onion, and both ways were quite good.  I also used a sage pork sausage.  Thanks for sharing!"
166642,254325,2009-12-31,5,These are tasty little appetizers. Very simple and they are addicting! Thanks for sharing.
1800285680,254325,2013-11-20,5,I have been making this reciepe for years as a Christmas treat! they are yummy and very tasteful at any occasion. The only downside is that they arent the healthiest snack in the pantry. In fact I also call them the hand held heart attack.
68884,50240,2003-01-27,4,I made this for the Super Bowl and it was a HIT -- guests scarfed them up.  I used a French baquette and just sliced it instead of cutting it twice as per recipe. I also used about half of the onion amount b/c it seemed like a lot of onion to dump into the mixture. I used reduced-fat mayo and it didn't seem to make a difference. These are good hot or cold!!
20214,50240,2003-11-15,1,"We really weren't too keen on this.
I'm not really sure why, but I not the adults or the kids liked it.  I made the recipce without any changes at all."
60486,50240,2009-05-28,4,"Very good appetizer or snack. Omitted the onion. Toasted the almond slices, wasn't sure if I was supposed to or not. I've made similar recipes before, this is the first with worcestershire."
174096,50240,2011-12-26,5,"Simple and good!  The almonds add a nice crunch, and the flavors were great.  Thanks for sharing!  PARTY '11"
69838,55220,2004-04-16,3,"This sandwich was ""okay"", but I'm not sure I would have it again. I'm not sure how low-cal this sandwich really is according to the calorie marks in the nutrition facts, especially considering that the cream cheese & taco sauce arent even included. The flavors of the sandwich ingredients didnt really go with the plain wheat bread in my humble opinion.  I think I would have preferred this in some sort of salad arrangement rather than on wheat bread, or maybe I would just have preferred it on some other kind of bread.  Maybe if Id toasted my bread I may have enjoyed it more than if I just did it as stated.  I also think that it might be better to mix the taco sauce into the cream cheese, instead of just drizzling it over. Overall it wasnt bad, but I just feel like it was missing something.  Thanks for the idea though. I will play around with this in the future to suit my tastes.  "
1535,293213,2008-04-16,4,Easy to make and delicious! It helped shake the winter blues when spring is taking too long to get here. ;o) I like how it is alcohol-free so the kids could enjoy it too.
383346,293213,2012-02-06,5,I made it for my son and he loved it.  He wanted another one after he finished drinking the 1st.  Thanks Alia :)  Made for Cookbook tag game
37513,29360,2002-05-31,3,"I haven't tried this exact version, but I do a similar one, but add loads of grated nutmeg to it.  It works well with the brown butter."
37449,122613,2005-09-22,5,I love baked beets. This is a good basic recipe. I added a little salt and pepper. Thanks Dancer^!
128473,492503,2012-12-29,5,"This recipe was really good, we enjoyed the corn prepared this way.  It was quick and easy to make, tasted great, had nice textures.  It was perfect served with  mashed potatoes and ham.  Thanks for sharing a recipe that I will make again."
227978,492503,2013-01-11,4,"This dish tasted quite good, and it's so easy to prepare.  I'm not sure if it was the touch of sugar or what, but preparing corn this way seemed so much tastier than the usual steamed corn that I usually make.  It makes quite a bit too, so it's great for a big crowd or when you want leftovers.  But I think I might have done something wrong because it turned out quite soupy.  I am not sure if I added too much milk or not enough flour (or something else altogether). But the taste was quite good, so I would make it again and just reduce the amount of milk and oil and see if that works better for me."
226863,492503,2013-03-31,5,"I cut this down to two servings, and it turned out very well.  I&#039;m always scared when I &quot;half&quot; an egg! I almost left more of the egg out.....really don&#039;t like the eggy corn puddings, prefer more of a creamy baked corn.  This wasn&#039;t creamy, but it wasn&#039;t overly eggy either.  Enjoyed this very much.....not time consuming to prep and baking it in the oven lets you take care of other dishes.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Holiday tag game."
2000135101,492503,2015-04-12,1,"Blah.  I used less milk but still ended up with a slop.  The sugar is a smart add, but this needed seasoning and butter to bring it back to life.  I&#039;m always trying new ways to serve corn other than steamed, but this will not be done again."
1800089386,492503,2015-12-21,5,"Just proves simple is good, great recipe.  I use a stick or immersion blender for all ingredents then added the corn and mix by hand.  Mix it and cook in one dish. Doesn&#039;t get any better."
237123,161115,2006-05-15,5,"Yumm, this turned out quite tasty.  Used ukon gold taters and a dash of carraway seeds in the tempeh/sauerkraut mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Loved the taste of the lemon tempeh grilles with the sauerkraut- they were fab together.  Thanks for posting this great recipe, it was perfect for a weeknight meal.  I'm always looking for vegetarian dishes using saurkraut!"
481371,257084,2007-10-31,4,This was delish!!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!!
1802593948,257888,2015-08-31,5,Delicious on eggplant bruschetta!
361226,160738,2006-10-23,5,"This is a tasty, unique alternative to the traditional egg casserole. The combination of flavors works well...the salty bacon balances the sweet apple and pears nicely."
39762,160738,2007-03-24,3,"I'm sorry my family really didn't care for this recipe. While everything was sautÃ©ing/baking the whole house smelled wonderful. From the title I thought the dish would have more of a pancake ""cake like"" texture. Instead it had more of an eggy/custard texture to it."
560491,398608,2010-04-18,5,"These are excellent!!! It is like having an apple pie without the work. Made as is, except I got 18 tarts out of the filling (I may have cut the apples too small, and they were pretty big apples). I will be making these for the holidays rather than a whole pie since I do not like pie leftover, it seems to get too mushy for me, and there definately will not be any leftovers with these.  I am going to have to get some more apples and use the other pie crust from the box and make a second batch, we cannot stop eating them!!  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
280271,398608,2012-12-25,5,Excellent little tarts...so easy to prepare...I also got 18 of them...good thing I have two mini muffin pans...these were a hit at our Christmas Eve get together...got gobbled up before I could get a photo...but the one posted is perfect...thanks for posting the recipe...:)
1802939361,398608,2016-12-09,0,Can these be frozen. If so how would I thaw and reheat them?
2001716786,398608,2017-09-16,5,"I used Johnny Mac from the orchard, they turned out amazing, better than I expected. I used cheap tart shells and cooked them a bit longer than called for, but wow. So quick and easy!"
2002325761,398608,2018-11-13,5,amazing!
428885,163600,2007-03-17,5,"Thanks KelBel for a beautiful and delicious recipe. I used this as a light salad course, adding a bit of olive oil drizzled on the top, fresh ground pepper, and some fresh basil. 
Yum, very tasty!"
1366254,169146,2009-11-27,5,Heavenly! Bacon and avocado go so well together
192581,163600,2006-07-03,5,"Simple, tasty and elegant are all the right adjectives for this recipe.  To make them a little easier to eat with your fingers, I suggest making sandwiches out of two slices of thin white bread and cut into 4 triangles.  I used an herbed goat cheese.  Thank you KelBel!"
945395,169146,2010-04-14,5,"These rock! I would call them a breakfast burrito, but they're even better than that. I used both ranch dressing AND salsa! I will make these again soon -- I'm bummed we ate them all before I could get a photo! Next time! Thanks, Dear!"
914720,47844,2010-08-03,5,"This has been a special breakfast treat for our family (originally from the Lancaster County area) for years.  Sometimes, we even have it for dinner.  We always serve it over toast, but biscuits and home fries sound great, too."
396736,47844,2011-04-05,5,"This is a keeper, tastes just like my mother used to make when I was growing up!!"
2127407,47844,2011-12-30,0,"I live in Lancaster county, and this is one of my favorite foods, my friends grandfater who is ex amish made some with bear bologna one time and it was the best i have ever had!!!"
194378,47844,2005-02-20,5,I grew up eating this! This was a real favorite served on my mom's homemade biscuits. We used almost any kind of leftover meat and served this for breakfast.
4439,47844,2005-02-21,5,"creamed chipped beef, yum. i chunk the beef in a strainer and pour some boiling water over it to remove some of the salt, then i use the same recipe. beyond wonderful over toast or home fried potatoes."
60992,47844,2005-11-02,5,"My DH and Dad adore this recipe! I usually use a little more butter and flour as they like it thicker rather than runnier but all in all this is the same recipe I use. It is fantastic over toast and we usually eat this as a dinner rather than at breakfast. We also call it SOS, no further explanation needed I am sure :)"
332010,47844,2006-07-07,5,WOw!  THis is what my mother use to make for us on special Sundays!  We got the dried beef at a butcher shop in Ephrata.  Now I will make it in MN and serv e it over toast just like mom did
335277,47844,2006-12-17,5,I can remember coming home for lunch to creamed chipped beef on toast. My mom used to substitute Budds wafer thin chipped deli beef since it was cheaper than those little jars of dried beef. My grandmother also made this for us as a treat when we visited her. My pennsylvania dutch grandma knew what a good economical dish was. Thanks for the memory WJKing. This one will definetly be in my cookbook.
558188,47844,2007-09-12,5,"This is so simple, quick and it tastes great! Perfect for that on the go family."
377581,47844,2007-10-23,4,Yum! I grew up eating this as a dinner. I use a little more flour as we like it thicker. It is wonderful over toast. Thanks.
1337577,47844,2009-07-28,5,"This is exactly like grandma always made!! It is one of my favorite dishes and unfortunately one they do not offer in Florida!!! I am originally from Graterford, PA and this is what you got when you ordered dried beef gravy!!!"
298070,47844,2009-09-04,5,This is a great simple recipe! My son said it was the best he ever had and I agree! I used evaporated milk.
823814,47844,2009-10-12,5,I add a couple dashes Worcestershire sauce and some black pepper for a little more seasoning. Goes great over wheat toast or biscuits.
490764,47844,2010-02-01,5,"Very good. I did add a little more flour.

Update: I made this today with about 8 ounces thin sliced deli turkey (cut up some). I also used 1/4 cup flour which I whisked into the cold milk before adding to skillet and 1/2 teaspoon salt was added as well. We loved it!"
55882,47844,2010-04-17,5,I have made this]several times and it is always a good meal. I made it tonight and use added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.

254614,47844,2012-05-28,5,"My husband's culinary skills were limited to this recipe, pancakes and eggs and fried fish.<br/>This was one of his favorities and our six-eight kids loved it. He served it with toast or fried potatoes. (We always had extra kids for supper or overnight)<br/>We purchased the dried beef in half case lots, bagged it in meal portions and stored or froze it.<br/>It was quick to make, very nutrious and did'nt cost an arm or a leg. We doubled or tripled the <br/>recipe and made in a large dutch oven."
369715,47844,2012-09-09,4,This was good but I added 1/2 teaspoon of pepper as my family thought it was missing something. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. We all enjoyed it.
2889933,47844,2014-06-30,5,I love dried beef gravy and this recipe is almost perfect!!!  All it needs is a touch of black pepper to set it off!  An easy and simple meal.  I serve it with sweet peas and fried potatoes.
1803011452,47844,2014-08-09,5,"I  hadn&#039;t had SOS in years but when my wife bought some dried beef the other day, I thought about it. This was pretty good, my wife loved it. Made exactly as written except added a pinch of pepper. I do think I will rinse the meat next time to reduce the salt."
949973,47844,2018-05-01,5,We always add sliced hard boiled egg.
2002364298,47844,2018-12-12,0,"One of my family's breakfast traditions. There is nothing that says off church Sunday morning to me! As others have pointed out, this recipe needs black pepper added to taste. Roger"
128473,482455,2012-08-02,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you Dienia B for sharing this great recipe.  It was so yummy, I can't wait to make this again.  It was quick and easy with very tasty results.  I used a good quality greek sheep feta and jumbo eggs, so glad that I did.  The cream, chives and green onions really elevated the lowly egg into something really special, served with portugese bread and mexican coffee for a memorable breakfast.  Made for the Fearless Red Dragons - ZWT8 - Australia"
383346,482455,2012-08-05,5,"I made only 1 serving for DH.  10 minutes of cooking was not enough.  I used half and half cream and fresh chives from my garden.  I omitted the green onion.  This is so yummy with the feta.  Thanks Dienia :)  Made for ZWT8 for Diners, Winers and Chives"
47892,482455,2012-08-12,5,"Very yummy! I also skipped the green onion and used one small shallot finely minced in its place. Fresh chives from our garden and homemade bread for dipping. I don't like eggs really runny and ended up cooking the eggs about 15 minutes. The muffin tins were lightly oiled with extra virgin olive oil and not Pam. This recipe will work for breakfast, brunch, appetizer, light dinner, etc. Very versatile! Reviewed for ZWT 2012. Thanks, DieniaB.!"
174096,482455,2012-08-12,5,"This is great - so easy to prepare and delicious.  I used ramekins and omitted the salt since the feta had plenty for us.  I pulled them out at 10 minutes and let them sit for a minute, and they were great - creamy and good.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT8"
286566,482455,2012-08-28,5,"Scaled this back for 2 and made in individual ramikins, baked at 190C fan forced for 10 minutes but white was not set so put on for a further 3 minutes but yolk was hard so I would need to bake for 11 to 12 minutes for a soft yolk but enjoyed sopping up the creamy cheesy sauce with the toast as did the DM and she prefers her yolks well done so it was perfect for here.  Thank you Dienia B. made for Please Review My Recipe."
129201,153362,2006-06-11,5,"Wow - what a gorgeous recipe! The outcome looks stunning and tastes delicious. I used my own recipe # 113729 to replace the frozen dough and weighed out 1 lb. Followed the recipe but used flaked almonds and gouda cheese.  I'm looking forward to making this again with the brie.
Thanks for an outstanding recipe!!"
27381,35277,2002-08-12,5,This is fun and yummy too! It's a great way to get kids to eat celery. My son likes to add lots of raisins to his.
28965,35277,2002-08-19,5,My son made these in preschool..he thought he was hot stuff.  lol  He made them for everyone that walked in the house.
6357,35277,2004-12-18,5,Ooh! This is one of my favourite snacks too! Incredibly easy and yummy!
71029,35277,2004-12-19,0,"Ants on a Log!!!  I grew up with these too, very good (I think our mom's knew it was good for us too...sneaky).  I havent tried it with the meats of sunflower seeds but I will- thanks for a memory!"
59780,35277,2004-12-20,5,I made these for my kids lunch. All three of my kids loved this yummy treat. My 7 year old made a second batch all by herself. Thanks for sharing this!
31364,35277,2005-01-16,5,"My mom made these for us all the time, we just adored them! YOu can also fill celery with cream cheese and top with shredded carrots. Not quite as adorable, but pretty and yummy, too!"
159559,35277,2005-01-31,5,This was one of my favorite snacks as a kid! For a twist try cheese wiz instead of peanut butter of sunflower seeds instead of raisins!
193516,35277,2005-08-08,5,These are SO not just for kids!!  I still enjoy them!  They are also delicious with dried cranberries instead of raisins.
96436,35277,2005-08-08,5,Mmmmm....  i used to make these all the time for my daughter and myself!  Sometimes for a late nite snack I would drizzle honey over the top!
101823,35277,2005-08-08,4,"This isn't just a kid's treat.  Adults love to snack on this, too.  It's simple, sweet, and relatively healthy."
209266,35277,2007-06-25,5,I was about to post this recipe. What a great childhood memory!
478330,35277,2007-10-30,5,i made these a couple months ago when my friends came over..they were very yummy and i used chocolate covered raisins instead and made it even better.
128541,35277,2007-12-15,5,I made these for the first time (can you believe it?) about a month ago!  Thanks for the recipe!
319609,35277,2007-12-26,5,I love this snack!
303427,35277,2008-01-20,5,"I grew up on this one too and it continues to be one of my very favorite snacks! Your recipe quantities on it are perfect! Sometimes, for an even more accessible treat, I cut the celery stalks into little bite-sized pieces and then top those with peanut butter and one or two raisins before devouring them. Yum! Thank you for the great post!"
346860,35277,2008-01-21,5,"My daughter's all-time FAVORITE snack. I love that I do not feel guilty giving this to her. Healthy, crunchy, a bit savory and sweet. What a fun recipe to post. Thanks for posting!"

693345,35277,2009-03-19,5,"If you read my profile, you will learn that raw celery and I have a hate/hate relationship, and it's pretty much been that way since I was in preschool. Why the 5 stars, you ask? Well, I give this 5 stars because of the creative ways my mom tried to get me to actually EAT it. She would dance the celery around about 1 inch above the table like it had invisible legs of a millipede - part of a non-existent conga line of other vegetables - all the while telling me how yummy it would be and humming some made-up tune. Also, once someone actually persuaded me to try this (probably some boy I had a crush on in kindergarten), it's actually not bad...however, for ME to like this, I have to put SO MUCH peanut butter on it that it really doesn't taste anything like celery anymore. Anyway, this recipe is a classic. Great posting. :)"
593927,35277,2009-09-22,5,These taste good.
1458294,35277,2010-03-07,5,delicious snack that's a childhood favorite
464080,35277,2010-09-24,5,"We made these as a craft at snack time at my son's preschool yesterday.  So cute and they kids got a kick out of ""eating bugs"".  They were ages 2 to 5 and EVERYONE tried at least 1 bite which was my goal.  Thanks for posting."
782749,310613,2008-07-09,4,"This was so good.
I doubled the recipe  and added 1/2 cup walnuts and 1 cup banana chips
I got 3 mediun loaves
thanks for sharing this yummy recipe"
6357,105681,2004-12-09,5,I've tried this on the stovetop and not the oven. It tastes so good!  
679953,386142,2011-07-23,5,"I wasn't sure about the first ingredient, so I used 2 pounds of boneless chicken breast, with open pit BBQ sauce.  Great wraps that punched great BBQ flavor in them.  Made four as directed, 1 for each of us, and devoured these with a side of fries.  Made for 2011 Cook Buffet."
1072593,360907,2010-03-21,5,"The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.  The sheer words ""caramel apple"" makes me drool.  Made for Alphabet Soup Tag."
266635,360907,2011-03-12,5,"This cake definitely lives up to its name.  It is a cross between a cobbler and a gooey butter cake and it was a huge hit at my Church potluck dinner tonight.  Even my husband loved the cake and he is not really an apple fan.  Thanks for the post.  Made this dish for PAC, 2011."
92816,360907,2011-06-18,0,"This is a very nice,moist cake.I love the spices in this cake.In addition to nutmeg and cinnamon I also added 1/2 tsp cloves and 1 tsp vanilla.I only used 3 apples and found that was plenty for me.I reduced the brown sugar to just 1 cup and it was fine.And I didn't make the caramel sauce,the cake itself is good enough without it!"
1320652,360907,2012-10-28,5,"Lovely cake! The preparation is so easy and quick, it is perfect for unexpected guests (and kids enjoy making it). I used wholewheat flour and it turned out great. The cake had such taste of caramel, that I served it with whipped cream rather than caramel sauce. Thank you!"
666681,360907,2012-11-11,5,This was a yummy cake! The only modifications I made was that I just used granny smith apples and only 3 since that is what I had on hand. I also doubled the carmel sauce since I served it with vanilla ice cream on the side and put the carmel sauce on both. I used my family as guinea pigs and they gave it rave reviews. I will definately make this again. <br/>Made for Fall PAC 2012.
199198,360907,2012-11-23,5,My all time favorite cake!! This is an excellent recipe...I sometimes use a combination of apples. Delicious!
1557932,360907,2014-03-17,5,This cake is amazing!  Reminds me of granny cakes my Grandma used to make when I was little.  I followed the recipe exactly...
833516,324047,2008-11-04,5,This is the bomb! Looks like puke but so awesome. I have been making this for years and any where it goes it always gets requests again and again!
59064,31191,2005-02-06,5,I didn't have sour cream but I did have Greek yoghurt which is nice and thick and substitutes well. Good dip recipe.
191626,3258,2005-04-18,5,"This recipe was quick and easy..delicious too.
I grilled chicken breast and steamed some broccoli to go along with the sauce and noodles. It was awesome!!!!"
223896,3258,2006-12-06,5,this usually how i make my alfredo sauce but i add about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to it too. i love it
339661,3258,2007-10-02,5,This recipe is bold and fantastic.  I add a jar of Green Giant sliced mushrooms to it for more flavor.
632370,3258,2007-10-30,5,I used half and half.  Who doesn't like Fettuccine Alfredo?
749790,3258,2008-02-02,3,This sauce is way easy to make and taste delious!! but I like to put mushrooms to add some flavor
733359,3258,2008-03-10,4,"This was very good.  I added the suggested 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and it gave it a wonderful boost and aroma.  To suit my husband's taste we added a few tablespoons of milk at the end, reducing the cheesy taste until he was satisfied.  This recipe worked fine with store-bought grated parmesan.  Enjoy!"
680747,3258,2008-07-29,4,"This great! I made it with milk and 2 tbsps of butter. But it still turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.
~Chris~"
204116,3258,2010-03-20,4,This had a good flavor and was easy to prepare. I will definitely add this to my tried and true list.
1249676,3258,2010-04-19,5,"Like everyone else said, this was so super easy it's insane!  And it tastes just fabulous.  I think I'm going to say goodbye to any more storebought ;-)  Why not, when this is just as easy, tastes even better, and doesn't have all those nasty preservatives in it?"
1479379,3258,2010-06-25,5,It was good i substituted the parmesan cheese for smoked mozarella only because i didnt have the parmesan cheese. I really liked it.
199848,270729,2010-09-21,5,"I deal for onion-lovers!  This is yummy with roasted or grilled meats.  I sliced mine really thin, leaving them in rings.  I used sharp cheddar cheese.  Delicious.  Thanx for posting!"
93438,303491,2010-03-04,5,"YUM!  I just had this for breakfast!  I had a couple avocados sitting around and was out of eggs, so I was trying to figure out how to prepare them for breakfast.  I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used a little splash of bottled and also added some crushed red pepper.  Spread on a thick piece of whole wheat toast - so good!"
2000804022,303491,2016-01-06,5,Nice and easy. Thank you!
2001258968,303491,2016-11-21,5,"I grew up eating avocado with lemon as well, but we used brown sugar instead. I will try it with the salt and pepper sometime though."
57256,92656,2005-07-07,5,"A very nice , moist snack cake bar . The whole family loved them . I added some chopped pecans to the top and dusted the cake with powdered sugar . Fantastic recipe that I will make again ! "
52282,92656,2004-10-09,5,"i don't have a jelly roll pan so i baked this in a 13x11 pyrex. i garnished the top with crushed walnuts, it took alot longer to cook, closer to 50 minutes, but this is wonderful. moist and delicious, more like a cake to me. we enjoyed this very much and it was so easy to make."
86520,92656,2005-01-21,5,"Very good, soft and very cake-like. I did as Chia did and sprinkled crushed walnuts over the batter before baking. I used a 17""X11"" jelly roll pan and only baked for 20 minutes. Thanks for posting a very tasty recipe."
223918,92656,2005-06-23,5,great for muffin recipe add 3 banana med size just wonderful
179827,92656,2005-10-04,5,"These bars are very nice and moist.  I used very ripe bananas, the flavor was wonderful.  I will definitely add this to my favorite recipes. Thanks!
"
251917,92656,2006-03-26,5,"Awesome, easy recipe. I made it exactly as directed above - my 3 yrd old even helped mush the bananas! I will be making these again soon!!"
162819,92656,2007-11-07,5,"I added 1/4 cup of buttermilk with the sour cream (I didn't want to take any chances of them being dry.) I baked them 25 minutes and frosted with cream cheese frosting.  My husband's response - ""Now, that's what I'm talking about.""  

We have tried several other banana bar recipes and none have been moist enough for our taste.  

This recipe is now going in the book.  

Thanks!!"
213909,92656,2010-02-26,4,"Very easy, but really just like banana bread, only baked in a jelly roll pan. I expect a bar to be firm enough to eat out of hand."
1701315,92656,2012-07-11,5,"These are super moist and intensely banana-y, but mine were fairly dense and took more like 50 minutes to bake...Still, they were awesome and easy to put together."
829250,92656,2012-07-19,5,This is more like a banana cake. Very good! Can't taste the sour cream at all. I added half of cup of walnuts. I baked it in a 9x13. Baked 35 min.
296809,229028,2008-03-06,5,"You are right-on to describe this as comfort food. This is meat & potato goodness for a DH + a kid-pleaser for a family. It is very easy-to-fix & budget-friendly too. I see this as a main dish that serves 4 more than a side, but admit I used more grd meat due to pkg size. I found the meat mix in need of seasoning & added salt + garlic. A few sprinkles of dried parsley on top for color & Voila! DH could not get enough of this, Brenda, & wants it ""at least twice a month"". Who knew? Not me, till I found your recipe. Thx for sharing it w/us."
206747,229028,2008-03-10,4,"Saw this with lovely picture in Swap Thread.  This was tasty -- took Twissis thoughts, and added salt, garlic, and a few dashes of hot sauce.  For 2 of us, there will be 2 MORE meals !!   Served with haricot vert with grape tomatoes and bacon.  Enjoyed !  Thanks, Nick's Mom."
61660,229028,2010-06-11,5,"This was great!  Shepards Pie with a twist, lol.  The egg and cheese topping was a great addition and made for a nice presentation.  Made for a Seasoned Sailor and his Sassy Sirens - ZWT6."
520644,229028,2010-06-14,4,A very nice dinner.  It was cold outside and this hit the spot.  Very easy and simple to prepare.  I did not get 6 servings out of this though. Made for ZWT6.
37449,297233,2009-09-13,5,I halved the recipe and enjoyed it with the crunch of the celery. The dill was a nice touch too! Thanks! Made for PAC Fall 2009.
610880,297233,2010-06-22,5,"Great recipe! I cut it in half and used dill pickles instead of dilll(3-4 sandwich stackers). I also lessened the mustard, turned out amazing;)"
199848,297233,2011-12-26,5,"Just how I like my egg salad.  I must have onions, celery and mustard in it, just like this recipe.  I also loved the dill.  Those plain mayo-and-egg salads are not for me!  I used Dijon mustard for the mustard, because it's my favorite.  We enjoyed this on lettuce with tomatoes and olives and the kids ate this with lettuce on lightly toasted bread.  Thanx for posting!"
55729,297233,2012-02-04,3,"This was ok. Despite the dill, it was a little plain. Perhaps I just needed to add more dill (it was very subtle)."
2000498330,297233,2016-07-27,4,The dill was subtle. Used coarse ground black pepper. Made sandwiches with butter lettuce on white wheat bread.
199848,199155,2007-05-24,5,Really good and filling!  I used Healthy Choice turkey smoked sausage.  It's a little sweet with a little kick to it.  Definitely will make this again.  Thanx for sharing.
128473,199155,2007-10-13,5,These were great baked beans. They were quick and very easy to make.  I used a spicy smoked sausage it gave the dish and added kick. We loved the flavour and texture of these beans and we found that the sausage complimented the dish perfectly.  Thank you so much for sharing a new favorite...bk
1843846,199155,2013-02-07,4,"I eliminated the brown sugar as we do NOT like the sweetness.  Into the beans, I add about 5 oz. chorizo,taking casing off (breaking off M&M size pieces and pushing down into bean mixture.  The smoked sausage on top - I sliced into piecs and laid on top, until midway thru cooking when I stirred them down into bean mix.  The bbq sauces today are way TOO sweet for my taste so I used a BBQ concentrate& marinade sauce called Woody's Cook-in Sauce."
41578,75496,2003-11-28,5,"What an easy, great tasting appetizer.  The crowd went wild and quickly ate them up (I should have doubled the recipe).  The only thing I did different was cut the amount of hot pepper sauce to about 3 drops since I was serving some people who do not like too spicy/hot food.  Sbsbea, this is a great find for me, thanks so much for sharing.  :-)
"
103628,75496,2004-12-25,5,"Very good.  I didn't use layered biscuits, and the ones I had were kind of small--so I just put the filling on top of one and smushed another on top of it all.  Turned out yummy.  I used a mix of turkey bacon and regular bacon.  Next time, I'll go a bit easier on the onion and heavier on the cheese.  All in all, very yummy, and popular during our Christmas get-together!  Thanks for the recipe!"
75497,75496,2005-05-02,5,"Wonderful!  I did the mini muffin pan version as suggested for an early Mother's Day ""tea party"", and these were gone in a flash.  I left out the hot sauce and sugar, and used dried chives in place of onions.  I'm making another batch tommorow by my husband's request since he didn't get any of the first batch. :)"
189616,75496,2005-06-08,5,"Delicious! I know this was intended to be an appetizer but I made them for breakfast instead, was looking for something really quick, and different for my family, other than weekday cereal, enjoyed by all of us. Used swiss, and chose the quick route, separating the biscuits instead of mini muffins.
Thank You-ms_bold!!"
52924,75496,2005-11-13,3,this was an ok recipe. i wasn't highly impressed. if i make it again i think i will make some changes that will fit my family's taste buds a little better.
174090,75496,2006-10-01,5,"I LOVED the flavor of these. I made 2 small changes - used only 1/2 onion and used MORE hot pepper sauce (it still wasn't too spicy). It has a really nice, almost tangy flavor. I was only able to separate most of the biscuits into 2 pieces instead of 3, so I had a lot of the topping left over, which I used as a filling in a grilled sandwich (YUM). Thanks so much, will make again!"
262312,75496,2007-12-18,5,"what a killer recipe!  i doubled the hot sauce (i use cholula) and omitted the sugar.  i used a mexican cheese blend.  served as a side with Recipe#135894, my Recipe#192357 and roasted garlic mashed potatoes!  loved it!  will be adding this to my keepers for sure.  next time i'll make these for breakfast! thanks so much for sharing!!!"
2123645,75496,2017-10-24,4,"These were pretty good. I'm not sure I liked the sugar, but otherwise they were very tasty. I used green onions to add some color and because I think they go well with bacon and cheddar."
323186,399719,2010-01-12,5,"Very quick and easy, and delicious!  Takes no time at all, and a lovely dressing on a favourite vegetable!   I love the almonds with this, I used nibbed rather than flaked almonds, but just loved them,  thank you, Tisme, very more-ish!

Made for Make My Recipe, Christmas Edition"
239758,399719,2010-06-17,5,"A delicious method for green beans -- even our Brazilian exchange student loved them (and Brazilians are not known for their love of vegetables). My only changes were to cook the beans in the microwave for 4 minutes and to use slivered almonds. Will make this often. Thanks for sharing.
UPDATE: Just a week after first making this, I asked the Brazilian exchange student to top and tail some green beans. She said yes, and asked if we could make them this way again. Such as amazing recommendation/request from someone who doesn't eat vegetables."
542159,399719,2010-09-07,5,"Quick, easy, and oh so tasty! The balsamic vinegar and garlic give off a lot of flavor with out over powering the beans and the almonds add a delightful crunch. We really enjoyed these beans and will be making again. Thanks so much for the post."
211331,399719,2011-01-02,5,"Tis me,I made this for the family on New Year's day.Because my balsamic was a deep ruby colour,the dish had a dark looking coating,but the taste was great.  I will be making this again....Don"
206747,399719,2011-12-10,4,"*Made for Australia/NZ Swap # 59*  Used out frozen beans from the Summer's garden, and prepared as listed.  A nice, flavorful side just a tad heavy on the balsamic.  Will surely prepare again.  Thanks for posting, Tisme !"
58104,129862,2005-09-29,5,I eye appeal you can just drizzle it into the well! I did it the way directed but thought it was not eye appealing! I have Fusion Avocado! Recipe #128746 posted and never worry about it turning brown. As in this case it will be brown from the vinegar.Unless you can find white balsamic. This was good I do favor mine but still this is 5 stars! I skipped the optional oil being avocados are high in fat!
209747,129862,2005-10-09,5,I skipped the oil as well and just used the balsamic. Very nice flavors- complimented each other well. 
60124,129862,2005-10-13,5,"this is a brilliant way to have avocado!!!, I do have a suggestion though.
I always put ""criss-cross"" cuts in the flesh, so that the vinegar gets down to the bottom. I dont use olive oil, but I have served this as an entree, with very finely shredded (tossed in olive oil) lettuce on top :)"
62562,129862,2006-07-30,5,This is our new favorite way to serve avocados. We usually skip the oil and use a high grade basalmic vinegar. A wonderful blend of flavors!
95743,129862,2006-08-01,5,"I did it Rita L's way and couldn't have been more pleased.  The best things are simple, don't you think?"
237123,129862,2006-09-03,5,"This is simple and lovely.  A neighbor gave us a bag full of ripe avocadoes so we have been eating them at all meals, basically.  I tried this out for a quick lunch the other day and I was surprised at how great it was.  Thanks for posting!"
274913,129862,2007-03-04,5,YUM!!! I was looking for a good excuse to eat avocados outside a salad or sandwich and didn't want to be so uncivilized as to chomp into it like a peach... This appears to be a legitimate dish for sophisticated diners. Thanks for the delicious facade!
312206,129862,2007-04-12,5,"This is great.  Antoine's in New Orleans has always served avocado halves filled with salad dressing.  I like it with the plain old bottled Italian dressing in it,too. I guess there is no way you could screw up an avocado!! I have been known to eat them with a spoon, without anything in them."
362983,129862,2007-04-26,4,"This was very quick, easy and tasty! The only thing I'd do differently next time would be to add some salt and pepper like I usually do. Thank you!"
429217,129862,2008-08-23,4,Very good!  I did add some Penzey's shallot salt & mignonette pepper.  I would also recommend eating this delight with some crusty bread to dip in the EVOO/vinegar mix.  Thanks for posting.
27416,129862,2008-10-01,5,"Hello Cookgirl;
Such a simple way of getting a different flavor.  Thank your DH for suggesting this.
I used 12 year old balsamic vinegar an grapeseed oil.  Just fantastic, we really enjoy avocados.
Thank you for sharing.
""Uncle Bill"""
43083,129862,2009-12-30,4,Heya CG! (waves) I made this tonight as a simple dinner and really liked it. The balsamic and EVOO brought a new taste sensation to the light tasting avocado. YUM. :)
702607,129862,2012-08-25,5,Lovely and super simple snack.  I have had this a few times and have been leaving out the oil and adding black pepper.  It is also good with chopped tomatoes.  Yummy!
358513,129862,2012-10-04,5,I love my avocados this way too!
407007,129862,2012-10-05,5,Simple & delicious! What a yummy snack. Thanks for sharing!
2000121716,129862,2015-04-06,5,Apparently Ernest Hemingway ate ripe avocados while in Cuba as an appetizer. He apparently would halve them and drizzle vinagrette dressing over them.
542159,391878,2009-10-03,5,"This is a childhood memory for me as well, my mother would serve this as a healthy desert. All I can say is yum and thanks for the memories."
634137,391878,2010-01-02,5,I used to dip my bananas in milk when I was little as well. Very good!
463435,391878,2010-03-09,4,"Very simple yet very pleasing. I have never had bananas in milk before so this was totally new for me. It made a very nice, light breakfast. Thanks for posting Acadia. Made and reviewed for the Feb.-March/Special Event 2010 Potluck Tag Game."
593927,391878,2010-07-02,5,With brown sugar.
573325,391878,2010-11-07,5,"This was a yummy and easy breakfast that kept me going for quite a while afterwards. Loved the combination of the mellow banana flavour with the cold milk. YUM!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing your recipe here with us, Acadia!<br/>Made and reviewed for your being VIP during Veggie Swap #28 November 2010."
320409,391878,2010-11-10,5,I'm 73 and this is still one of my favorite treats for breakfast.
228458,391878,2010-11-30,5,"Like other reviewers, this takes me back to the childhood days of bananas in my cheerios and rice krispies--I had totally forgotten about doing that!! What a treat to get a chance to share this with my son :). Made for Veg*n Swap 28."
678366,391878,2010-12-25,5,never tried it before but I liked it.And so did my girls.
1805545,391878,2011-05-29,4,I love this.  So simple and tasty too.  I skipped the sugar and it was wonderful.

50509,391878,2012-07-23,5,"This takes me back to my childhood, where my dad would make it for me. But it was not with milk - rather, with half and half! Oh, for the days when you could afford the calories!  Ripe but not overripe bananas are the key, to minimize the need for sugar"
621626,391878,2012-08-14,5,I love bananas in my cereal but I never thought to eat them with just milk. Very yummy! Made for Ramadan Tag 2012
2707708,391878,2013-02-23,5,"Loved this as a kid and still do now!  Try sprinkling just a bit of nutmeg and a splash of vanilla in the milk, makes it even better!"
2827194,391878,2013-05-15,0,My grandma told me to make these once I was 7 or 8 now im some years older I still love them and thats why I keep making them I hope more people find this recipe because its easy and delicious!
37449,122366,2008-01-29,5,"Had this for a breakfast treat this morning.  I used berry yogurt, as that is what I had. Thanks! Made for the Zaar Stars game."
422893,122366,2008-09-16,5,"Yum, this was delicious, toddler DD & I both enjoyed it, thanks!"
461834,122366,2007-10-16,5,"Delicious!!!  I used frozen strawberries, fresh banana, non-fat vanilla yogurt and the rest as stated.  Great refreshing morning breakfast drink.  Made for football pool, congrats on your win Lauralie!!!"
141293,122366,2007-10-20,5,A nice sweet/tart smoothie.  Perfect for breakfast or afternoon snack.  Use frozen banana and berries for a thicker smoothie.
143721,122366,2007-10-22,5,Excellent and refreshing beverage.  I doubled everything and my DW and DD enjoyed this with me.  Another winning recipe.
9717,122366,2005-05-19,5,I must admit I did not actually check to see what the ingredients were in this recipe before I decided to prepare and rate it for the strawberry swap.  I was pleasantly surprised though.  This was very good.  I did chill the cranberry juice and I also doubled the recipe.  Thanks for posting!
137911,122366,2005-12-06,5,"Surprisingly delicious!  I was expecting this to be tart with the plain yougurt and cranberry juice, but it was quite sweet...even with me using 'light' cranberry juice.  It almost tastes like a strawberry cheesecake.  "
88099,122366,2005-12-11,5,Excellent flavor.  I used a frozen banana and frozen blueberries and it turned out great.  Very nice blend of flavors.  I'll be making this again for sure.  Thanks.
324390,122366,2007-01-29,5,Wonderful smoothie that would be great for a summer breakfast. I used mixed frozen berries and otherwise followed the recipe as written. Next time I will try it with strawberries. Thanks for the keeper Lauralie
67103,122366,2007-08-08,5,"I used frozen strawberries and bananas, stawberry yogurt and white cranberry juice.  I have been making smoothies to get my youngest child to eat fruit and he loves them.  We really enjoyed the addition of honey for the sweetener.  Thanks for a keeper!"
795599,411947,2010-03-23,5,"Great for a simple supper or snack when you're craving cheese but know you have to eat something else healthier with it! I tried this twice, once with frozen corn and the next time with frozen corn on the cob that was shelled. Very simple to make and enjoyably filling; can't wait until July when there's fresh corn to be picked and used. Thanks, The Swedish Chef!"
92641,61350,2005-01-11,5,"A nice fancy way to serve asparagus if you are having dinner guests. I steamed fresh asparagus and drizzled this sauce over it, serving while hot. I think the cheese gives this dish enough salt flavor, but it was fine with a bit added also. This was rich and tasty - a real treat.  Thanks for posting!"
68312,51551,2003-01-17,0,I have been looking for this recipe for years.  The lady who use to make it at church died.  I will try it this weekend.  Will let you know how it is.  Thank You!!!
124614,51551,2004-10-07,4,"This is very good. I spent an entire summer in Croatia studying rural economics and was served this quite often. It is a little sweeter than what I was served, so not as ""authentic"" but still very good. There was no baking time, and so in my bizarro-oven I went for 20 minutes. I think next time I may cut the brown sugar in half and swap 1/4 cup of the flour for another 1/4 cup of corn meal. Thanks! Very yummy. Oh, and I served with raspberries, plain, no syrup. Its also traditionally served with ""cottage cheese"" which isn't the lumpy stuff in our stores, but more like queso fresco or farmer's domestic cheese. I could eat that stuff all day!"
179827,51551,2006-08-05,5,"I love to try different recipes for cornbread.  Looking at the ingredients, I wasn't sure how it was going to come out, but it was great.  I like a sweeter bread; this was a little less sweet than I'm used to, but it was very moist and delicious.   I will definitely make it again.  thanks!"
153623,394523,2009-10-17,4,This was easy and tastey.  The recipe doesn't give an oven temperature so I used 350F.  Left the nuts out b/c of allergies.  I'll probably make this again but substitute applesauce for at least half of the oil b/c I could taste that the oil was in there.  I wonder if melted butter would work for part.
97166,257888,2010-05-11,5,incredible! thanks for posting!
78232,257888,2009-01-13,5,GREAT recipe!  I had some steak at a restaurant with a similiar glaze and it was 2-die-4!  This is just what the 'chef' ordered- thanks for sharing!
135271,257888,2009-02-22,5,"This is what I made by mistake one day, and my kids loved it.
I was cooking chicken at the time.

Also try it with molasses instead of brown sugar, very good."
289255,149966,2006-05-07,5,"These were simple and fun. Be sure to use a medium/large bowl because the egg whites expand. I used unsweetened coconut and only 1 cup sugar, but they were plenty sweet. Best served warm. Hard to stop eating them!

Great recipe to make with kids--the egg whites are fun, not too many ingredients and quick to make."
408766,149966,2006-12-16,4,"I used a whisk and beat the whites by hand, which I knew would be tricky and time consuming but it worked well for the texture.  Also, I gradually added 1 cup of powdered sugar (in lieu of 1 1/4 while I was still whisking the whites.  The only thing is if you do not beat the whites long enough they spread too much in the oven and the outsides burn.  DO NOT make the mistake of lining your pan with foil- they stick badly.  Other than that, the cookies turned out beautifully.  I also tried forming the cookies into little mounds larger than what the recipe called for and they turned out chewy and soft with the traditional macaroon look."
353579,149966,2007-05-19,4,"A nice, easy sweet for coconut lovers.  I may try drizzling some chocolate on them next time.  Thanks for posting."
286566,461483,2011-10-24,5,"This was my time using artichokes, I bought a 170gram jar (6oz) and scaled the recipe back and 3 of us devoured the lot a lovely creamy cheesy texture that went well with recipe #362708.  Thank you time3to1dance5, made for PAC October 2011."
135566,475298,2012-06-03,4,Very easy and very good breakfast.  I did fry the bacon before adding it to the eggs. Also used 2 tablespoons of cheese. Made for Spring 2012 My 3 Chefs
369715,475298,2012-09-06,4,"I made this for my son before school today. I ended up using three eggs, 2 tablespoons of bacon bits and 2 tablespoons of cheese. I also added a good bit of pepper. My son enjoyed this as there wasn't anything left on his plate."
202226,97010,2005-03-12,3,"This recipe was pretty good.  I don't like to use all the oil, so I used the same amount of unsweetened applesauce instead.  I also would use a full cup of mashed banana in the recipe next time.  It is a super recipe to use up all that fruit."
29410,97010,2005-09-14,5,"I doubled this recipe then put it into, BIG muffin tins, they took about 30 min  to cook & also didn't mash the banana's, but chopped them.  Used buttermilk instead of the oil.  They are really good"
470262,97010,2007-04-13,5,"These were exactly what I was looking for. They were easy, delicious, and called for exactly the ammount of strawberries and banana that we had lying around needing to be used.  Thanks for sharing this."
249657,97010,2007-06-17,4,"I modified this recipe quite a bit to make them vegan, and it was a great base to work from. I'm sure the original will work for a lot of people. I also added a bit of baking spice (or just use cinnamon) for taste. Yum!"
199848,97010,2011-04-28,5,"These were a huge hit with my kids!   We had some overripe bananas and tons of strawberries from a local PYO farm, so this recipe was perfect.   They were moist and yummy.  I should have doubled the recipe, because they were gone in a matter of hours.  Thanx for sharing!"
2025705,97010,2011-10-05,5,"AWESOME muffins, whipped up a batch for breakfast this morning and everyone LOVED them! I only had one egg on hand and ran out of vanilla after a few drops, added in some extra banana and used canola oil instead of butter, they tasted wonderful still!"
852554,97010,2012-02-27,5,"These were pretty good but next time, I would use a well greased muffin pan instead of liners as the muffins are sticking in them pretty badly."
2256543,97010,2012-05-10,5,"I usually make banana bread, but I had a taste for something different this morning. These are moist and delicious! With a darker pan, 17 minutes was perfect."
2919349,97010,2013-08-09,4,"Great recipe! As a college student I need a quick breakfast, so I freeze muffins. I used half whole wheat flour and applesauce in place of oil. Moist and tasty! Will use again, but next time add some spices."
369715,97010,2013-12-09,4,This were really good and easy to make. I had frozen strawberries and banans so I thawed them for this recipe. I followed the recipe as written other then mine were done in 15 minutes.
2001998279,97010,2018-02-18,5,"These came out great. Didnt have vanilla, but added some cinnamon."
60716,144329,2009-09-23,5,"These are melt in your mouth fantastic shortbread cookies! I used almond extract in place of the vanilla but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Definately worth having a cookie or 6 with a nice hot cup of tea! 
Made for PAC Fall 09."
248023,103529,2007-12-12,5,"You were so right when you said it was hard to stop eating it!!!  I love anything with garlic and since I am Thai... I also LOVE rice!!!  So this was the best of both worlds for me...  I considered scaling this down to half since there is only 2 of us... but I am so glad I didn't.  I used about 4 large garlic cloves and slowly toasted them along with the rice on the stove top.  It took me about 10 minutes since I wanted to be sure I didn't burn either...  I loved the fact that this pilaf cooked at the same temperature as Recipe #57153, and I didn't have to ""babysit"" either.  This was by far THE BEST pilaf I have ever had... delicious crunchy edges and it baked up so tender and perfectly seasoned.  My BF, who is not a big fan of rice, even had seconds... YUM!!!  Thanks for sharing!"
160974,231868,2007-06-07,5,"I make banana smoothies almost everyday and this was a nice way to enhance the flavor. I used toasted walnuts (2 tbs) and you could really taste them. Thanks Internetnut, for posting.

Roxygirl"
407338,231868,2008-02-11,5,"Yes, it was AWESOME!  The flavor of banana and walnut reminded me of banana walnut bread.  The bits of walnut blended with the honey. Oh my, Oh my!!  I added 1/2 cup of milk to this shake and it made exactly one full glass.  Very delicious.  I only shared one little sip with DH and he agreed.  As a member of TOPS I always enjoy their recipes and thanks internut (Christine) for posting this one!"
593927,231868,2010-12-31,5,Wonderfully tasty!!! I did have to add a couple dashes of spring water to blend it easily. This makes 1 cup but 1 cup is not much for a smoothie. Yet filling with all that walnut. I used organic Canadian honey and organic no fat yogurt. I may make this again.
682964,103529,2008-01-15,4,"This had great flavor and was a nice change from plain rice.  I made it with brown rice to make it a little more nutritious.  The best part was that my husband, who doesn't like rice, enjoyed this dish!"
110946,103529,2004-12-10,5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. I love the garlic flavor. The recipe was very easy to make. I added more pepper as we prefer alot. Thanks for the great recipe"
79229,103529,2005-02-15,5,The rice smelled heavenly as it was baking. I used a generic brand of rice that was transformed into a dream side dish. Thanks Lynnie 
78808,103529,2005-09-14,5,"Delicious!  Served with Roasted Halibut with Tomato Cream Sauce #61383 by CountryLady, and they went well together.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!
Dianne"
191015,103529,2006-03-13,5,"This is the best!  I used Jasmine rice, because it's my favorite and added 1/2 t. turmaric with the salt and pepper.  Wow, what a treat!!"
158086,103529,2006-03-19,5,Served this rice dish with Baked Porcupine meatballs...a great combination.   I added some pine nuts to the rice....yumm
322835,103529,2006-06-10,5,Excellent recipe.  It came out nice and fluffy.  I made a double batch and used the directions here.  It was just perfect.  Had it with Barbequed ribs and Hearts of Palm and Spinach salad from this site.  Everyone owwed and ahhed about this meal. 
339577,103529,2006-08-18,5,"Tasty, healthy, easy and quick to make, recipe doesnt specify what kind of long-grain rice to use as there are several kinds out there-I used plain long-grain not converted or instant."
51011,103529,2006-10-29,3,"This dish was good- but it didn't wow us.  No changes were made at all. If I were to make it again, I would perhaps add some spices.  Thanks!  "
173880,103529,2007-04-02,5,Excellent! I added extra garlic and 1 tsp. of chicken base plus 2 1/2 cups water instead of the chicken broth. The rice came out perfectly cooked and so light and fluffy! Will definitely be making this again!
250812,103529,2007-06-22,3,"this was ok. it had a little too much liquid for us. although thats an easy fix. the flavor was pretty good, and i'm sure it would be better when i fix the liquid part. i'll be making this again."
511388,103529,2007-07-17,5,Great rice!  My family really enjoyed this recipe.
165082,103529,2007-09-02,5,What a simple delicious dish.  So simple to bake it in the oven when you are getting everything else ready for a meal.  Even my fussy husband liked it.
320288,103529,2007-10-29,5,This is fantastic...I make it all the time now. Thank you
357358,103529,2008-01-21,4,I used vegetable broth to make this and served it with spicy ribs. This pilaf was a good complement to the BBQ sauce. I needed the dish to have a touch of color as there was too much white in my meal so I added some Italian herb and parsley which went with the flavor very well. Thanks!
589653,103529,2008-01-30,0,"I am not rating this as I am not sure if I used the correct rice.  Following the recipe exactly my rice was very dry and overcooked.  Seventy minutes is long.  I used Carolina enriched extra long grain.  When I pulled it out of the oven, it was like confetti.  Any ideas on what went wrong??"
274057,103529,2008-03-19,5,My family LOVES this rice.  I always double or triple the recipe and use a big oblong pyrex baking dish.  Left-overs and make flavorful Chicken-Rice soup the next day.  The mild garlic flavor is just wonderful.  Great with baked Salmon or Pheasant!
215533,103529,2008-03-30,5,"This is an excellent side dish. I did use long grain brown rice. The first time I kept the liquid and cooking times the same The next time, I doubled the recipe, again used the Long Grain Brown Rice, but increased the broth a total of 5 cups, and increased the cooking time to an hour up from the 45 minutes. It was perfect, and all gone."
811461,103529,2008-04-07,0,"This was very good, I added just a bit more broth toward the end and also reduced the cooking time to 60 instead of 70 min. but I don't think it would have burned if I had left it the whole time.  Crunchy on edges, creamy in the middle.    Everyone loved it!  I made it for Easter now I'm making it again for a pot luck."
619511,103529,2008-05-05,5,"I needed a rice side dish for a barbeque that had kabobs I wanted something that could stand alone because there would be no sauce.  Well end result is my kabobs were ok but everyone I mean everyone raved over the rice.  Good thing because I had made 30 servings.  I made it early in the day about 8am and after it finished cooking I made one small change and added a handfull of parmesan and mixed it in.
Super thanks."
440735,103529,2009-01-06,4,Good!  Mine was a little dry. I may add 1/4 more chicken broth.
1084367,103529,2009-03-02,5,this is a great side dish.  loved the fresh garlic taste.  i added parmesan cheese.  next time i will add some parsley.  thanks
262312,103529,2009-04-04,5,"excellent recipe!!  i usually do instant rice in the microwave because i'm terrible at making rice!  but this is an easy recipe to follow and turned out perfect!  made as written but added some onion, doubled the butter, probably tripled the garlic, added fresh parsley and 2 thyme sprigs.  it smelled insanely delicious as soon as i put it in the oven!  fabulous!  will use this method many times with various seasonings/flavors/veggies.  thanks for the keeper!!  love it!"
411045,103529,2009-05-12,5,"This was fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and had only needed to add abuot 10 minutes cooking time, and that may have been more just for my liking than anything (it was still a bit too moist in my opinion before the added time.)  It didn't get crispy around the edges like I expected it would, but it was great none the less.  Served it with freshly caught snapper and amber jack fish that we cooked on the grill.  I will certainly keep this recipe handy!"
232463,103529,2009-05-16,5,"Very good recipe (and forgiving!) that will be going into rotation at my house.  I melted my butter and did the whole thing in my cast-iron dutch oven. (Saved washing a skillet!)  When I went to crush my garlic cloves, I found my bulb had started to sprout (Eep!), so I used 1 tablespoon of garlic paste I had on hand - adding it with the first cup of broth after browning the rice.  The liquid amount and times worked out perfectly for me.  DH absolutely loved it, and he usually doesn't care for rice side dishes.  I did get the crispy edge and creamy center, and looked a lot like the photo.  Thanks for the wonderful and easy recipe!"
113249,103529,2010-02-02,1,"When I first read this recipe I thought it sounded very bland but I tried it because of the reviews, It was even more bland than I thought it would be. We ended up throwing it all out."
827374,103529,2010-10-31,4,"This one is definitely a little time consuming, but I'm a big fan of the end result. This baked rice is a great, healthier alternative to fried rice. We've used it as an accompaniment to stir fry and grilled fish. Plus the house smells divine while it bakes!"
333017,103529,2011-03-08,3,"Although my family enjoyed this baked rice...and I got to use up some chicken broth that needed to be use up...I found that this rice was finished cooking in 55 minutes, which meant I had to rush to get the rest of the dinner ready.  I turned the oven off and let the rice sit in the oven to keep warm.  I liked the concept of the recipe...but next time, I would consider using brown rice and cooking it for 1 hour total"
866963,103529,2011-10-06,5,The rice was done perfectly and very flavorful. I enjoyed how quickly it came together and it will be making many future appearances on my menus. (32)
91392,103529,2012-10-09,0,"Good, easy and cheap.  Lots of little variations possible.  I always double it for leftovers."
176843,103529,2014-10-13,0,We love this dish. I use it in my OAMC/freezer cooking rotation - I prepare all the way through adding the last 1 1/2 cups of broth and freeze. When I am ready to serve this I bake it directly from the freezer at 375 for 45-60 minutes and it turns out perfectly!
1803005318,103529,2015-02-19,5,"It takes more time than the standard way to cook rice, but it&#039;s good.  The only thing I changed was using olive oil instead of butter to make it a bit more healthy.  Other than than, the rice came out very moist and favorable."
540346,103529,2015-05-28,5,"I have made this twice now: once with jasmine rice and once with a wild rice blend.  They were both delicious.  However, I must admit that I prefer the complexity of the wild rice flavor with this dish.  The nuttiness of the rice melded with the garlic flavor was amazing.  The wild rice blend did take longer to cook, but was well worth it.  The rice seemed moister with the wild rice, too.  The leftovers were even better than when it came fresh out of the oven.  Yummmm!"
355282,103529,2017-06-04,5,I am a pretty seasoned cook but had never made rice in the oven! It's the ONLY way to go! We love this recipe. The rice turns out perfectly and it is SO versatile! Thank you so much for posting!
1330774,247758,2010-01-20,5,Just like my mom makes it...
199848,370161,2009-05-13,5,Creamy and tasty.  Pretty much excactly how I make my coleslaw.  (Gotta have the onions in it!)  It's pleasantly tangy and great for picnics.  Thanx!
37636,370161,2009-05-18,5,"This great tasting slaw has a light sweetness that is not overly so, and a great crunch without any offending flavors. This would be great for any picnic or potluck. Make sure you copy the recipe when serving to friends as I am sure they will be asking for the recipe for themselves. Everyone here absolutely enjoyed. Made by a Saucy Senorita for ZWT5."
246482,370161,2009-06-08,5,very nice I have made this for our supper but I grabbed a bowl for my lunch with some French bread and spreads.Made for ZWT5 the Zingo Round. Made for  Cooks with dirty Faces.
58104,370161,2009-06-08,5,"I made this with the package sliced cabbage and carrots. I did add onion. The dressing I did follow and the cabbage, onions, and carrots were les then 1/2 the amount making a great slaw.
Made for ZWT5.
Thanks!!! ;)"
37449,370161,2009-06-09,5,"I enjoyed this slaw! I usually don't add onions, or if I do, add scallions, so this was a litttle different. I thought it was just the right amount of sweetness. Thanks Bellinda! Made for ZWT 2009- Zingo."
552613,370161,2009-06-09,4,A very nice coleslaw.  I used fat free milk and mayo and splenda instead of the sugar and everything still worked well.  I had some as a side as one meal and had some on a chicken sandwich and it was good both times.  Made for the Zingo portion of ZWT5 for the Chow Hounds.
369715,370161,2009-06-12,4,I had a bag a preshredded coleslaw mix so I used that instead of the cabbage and carrot but followed the rest of the recipe as written other then I used Splenda instead of sugar and 2% milk instead of milk. Made for Zingo ZWT5.
330545,370161,2009-06-13,5,"I just plain like to snack on slaw and this is a very good one. Made for Zingo, ZWT5.  Oh yeah, served on a cabbage leaf for a fun presentation."
199792,370161,2009-06-14,5,I have to say this is a perfect coleslaw. It is not terribly different than my usual slaw except for the freshly squeezed lemon juice and that is what makes it taste so incredible. I will never make slaw without lemon juice from now on!!! I did use low fat mayo which didn't seem to create a problem. Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe. Made for ZWT5 Hell's Kitchen Angels.
538578,370161,2009-06-14,5,This was excellent! It really did taste authentically Aussie and reminded me of childhood barbecues with grilled sausages and coleslaw. I reduced the sugar slightly and used cider vinegar and it was delicious. Thanks for posting.
803511,370161,2009-06-14,5,Great coleslaw recipe.  Loved the sweetness and the slight tang combined with the bite of the onion.  I might toss in some raisins next time I make it!  Thanks for posting.  Made for ZWT5.
61660,370161,2009-07-22,5,"So, I cheated a bit and bought preshredded cabbage and carrots. The rest of the recipe I followed.  Liked the addition of the onion, I minced mine pretty fine.  Dressing has a touch of tart and a touch of sweet.  Perfect with burgers!!"
463435,370161,2009-08-05,5,"This is a wonderful coleslaw recipe! Until I found Recipe Zaar KFC's coleslaw was the only one I could tolerate. Then last year at the Farmer's Market a farmer bartered with me for some of our baked goods and he threw a nice big cabbage in with the corn. I didn't want to waist the cabbage so I tried several different coleslaw recipes and found out just how good it can be. With that out of the way, I have to say this is more then a 5 STAR coleslaw!  The sweet, tangy flavor is so yummy. I will be making this again soon. Thanks for posting this recipe. Made and reviewed for the 13th Vegin' Swap."
212609,370161,2010-04-12,4,"An enjoyable coleslaw recipe.
The sweet edge and the light tang from the vinegar and the lemon really made it.
Thanks for sharing."
27783,21428,2003-03-01,5,"Thank you for sharing this simple, yet tasty recipe.  I was very ill and my husband and daughter cooked this to accompany supper. Simple enough for a beginner cook to follow and produced very tasty garlic bread.  Enjoyed by all!"
35526,21428,2003-09-24,5,"Could not be simpler or more tasty.  I only made a half a loaf and used 6 cloves of crushed garlic.  I did not melt the butter, just let it get room temp and mixed it with the half ton of garlic.  YUMMM!  Went very well with our lasagna."
32772,21428,2003-09-29,5,"This is easy and taste great. I didn't broil the bread but stacked the slices as if the bread was just sliced, covered in aluminum foil and baked in a 375 degree oven for 10 minutes. Mmmmm...good"
31499,21428,2003-10-01,5,"Simplicity at it's best.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  So easy to put together, and is ready in no time at all.  A very simple recipe that makes a huge impression. A keeper for sure!"
37106,21428,2003-10-02,5,What could be simplier yet packed with more garlicky goodness than this recipe? I too used more garlic and prepared this in a matter of minutes. Sometimes a recipe doesn't need all that added stuff. Simple and basic is sometimes best which certainly holds true for this recipe. Thank you so much Miss Nezz!
28649,21428,2003-10-26,5,"Very good garlic bread.  So simple and easy to make, I will make it often.  Everyone in the family really enjoyed it.  Thanks Mizz Nezz."
36944,21428,2004-01-26,5,A quick and easy bread that makes a tasty addition to any meal.  
48288,21428,2004-12-02,5,"I never buy store gaslic bread any more... this is so much better. I add more garlic and a little dry parsley for a great presentation.
"

101823,21428,2005-12-07,4,"I sliced my bread prior to brushing with the butter and garlic mix, and used roasted garlic in the butter.  Toasted on parchment on a cookie sheet, this was excellent garlic bread."

"
426062,21428,2007-03-25,5,Very good basic recipe.  I decided to let my Italian heritage show through by adding more garlic and drizzling some EVOO into the butter/garlic mix.  Then I sprinkled salt and some dried oregano flakes on top.  That made it taste just like in a restaurant.
133174,21428,2007-05-30,5,Easy and delicious...who could ask for more?  Made this to go with lasagna.  It was perfect.
454804,21428,2008-02-20,5,Wonderful!! after broiling I sprinkled one half with 4 cheese mexican cheese and broiled another minute. Thanks
302094,21428,2008-03-15,5,"This is great bread! I made stuffed shells so of course I needed a bread to go with it, and this fit the bill. I did add mozzerella cheese before I broiled the bread. I will definately be making this again. Thanks, MizzNezz!"
808535,21428,2008-06-01,5,"Absolutely perfect! My brother recommended this recipe to me and said I should sprinkle some dried Oregano on top to make it look better. So delicious, I will definitely make this again."
486078,21428,2008-11-03,5,This is perfect!  I'm working on getting my meatball and spaghetti sauce recipe just right to make public and  this is the garlic bread I will suggest serving with it!  Thx. for posting such a simple and delish recipe. I will use the fresh orgeano as someone suggested.
294274,21428,2008-12-30,5,"I love the flavor of this garlic bread. It will hold it's own in a meal, yet is not overpowering and I love the fact that it only uses 3 ingredients! Thanks for sharing! This will accompany every Italian dinner in our house!"
309923,21428,2009-01-10,5,"Wonderful garlic flavor, and just what I was looking for in a garlic bread recipe; real garlic, not garlic salt and butter.  I microplaned the garlic, and added a little bit of oregano.  Thanks!"
140132,21428,2009-12-09,5,Wonderful!  I love the simplicity of this bread.  Its what it is....garlic bread.  I like that you can taste the bits of garlic and butter.  Thank you so much for sharing.
392458,145046,2006-11-22,5,I have used this receipe for 2 years now-it is the only way my Sweetie will eat turkey !!!
389238,145046,2006-11-29,5,My entire family raved over this turkey on Thanksgiving.  The meat was so...tender and the skin crispy and delicious.  I plan to use the recipe everytime I cook a turkey.
54678,145046,2007-04-08,5,I used your method for cooking our 13 lb turkey but used the spice rub #168782. Started the turkey on the bbq at 450 degrees then moved it into the oven when available and cooked at 500 degrees for total of 2 hours. The turkey was falling apart so it didn't really get a chance to get crispy but will definitely use this method again.
64667,145046,2007-11-24,5,"The title says it all:  AWESOME!   Beautiful caramelization!  I really MUST get a bigger pan for roasting, as my blue-speckled enamel was just a smidgen too small...and YES, in the places where the turkey touched the metal--it stuck like super glue.  Boo hoo!  (a little holiday poem)   Wow!!!! To have a turkey bake THIS quickly is wonderful--because THEN you can actually use the oven for something beside the turkey (and heating the entire house!)."
356127,145046,2008-11-19,5,"this is FANTASTIC-have done it now 2 yrs,only thing i do different is i rub olive oil on and then coat heavily with kosher salt,salt does not take out juices,but tenderizes it,and everone says it is mild like tuna,i love turkey."
630195,145046,2008-12-25,5,"Take the plunge and try this method!!  I cannot believe it but this turkey was juicier and more flavorful than the brined turkeys I've been doing for years and sooooo much easier.  I did use ""uncle bill's"" method of shrinking the skin around the bird with boiling water (cool looking even if it doesn't add anything :0) ).  I rubbed the turkey with herbs, pepper, butter and oil mixed together.  So simple and quick!  Thank you very much for posting!"
1743918,145046,2010-11-25,5,"I was a rock star after stumpling into this receipe. We had 16 over last Thanksgiving and all agreed this was the most moist, best flavor turket ever served. As for me being the cook, it was easier and faster than any of the others I have ever tried. With this methos i didn't brine although I guess you could, but once you try it you will never go back. Only problem is most of the left overs went out the door. Last year we did another one the weekend for a week of left overs!"
1486098,145046,2013-11-05,5,"I have been cooking a 24 lbs. turkey, at 500 degrees, for the last three years, it is great, turns out very moist, and takes about three hours. The flavor is great, I first rub the turkey inside and out with a cut lemon, and an orange,  season the inside with salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, and loosely stuff with a quartered onion, some cut celery, fresh rosemary and fresh oregano sprigs, the lemon and orange. I make a mixture of salt, pepper, Poultry seasoning, mashed garlic, olive-oil, canola oil, then loosen the skin on the breast  and around the thighs, I rub this mixture under  the skin,  ties the legs, fold the wing tips under the bird ( I do all this the day before Thanksgiving), I keep the turkey in a non reactive pan,  cover well with plastic wrap, refrigerate overnight.  Two hours before baking, take out of fridge, brush top with melted butter or oil, place in pan, and  roast."
2000700888,145046,2015-11-22,5,"I have used the high heat roasting method for more than a decade, always use a brined bird, dried (uncovered) in the frig for half a day. Love the lemon, seasoning (don&#039;t forget the sage) &amp; onion in the cavity.  I don&#039;t use any foil during the roasting time.  
Here&#039;s the best hint I have to add: cover the bottom of the roasting pan wih very coarsely cut root vegetables (I use onion, carrot and celery) to catch the drippings and avoid the dreaded smoke and fire from the drippings.  Using the vegetables you omit any added liquid and get crispest skin and true roast flavor.  The drippings are the best, just press through a sieve to strain for gravy base."
2001817461,145046,2017-11-22,0,"Was planning to stuff turkey, placing stuffing under breast skin and in neck cavity. Would hi temp still work in this case?"
482376,326910,2014-08-18,5,"Excellent pesto! I&#039;ve never made one with sun-dried tomatoes and I really like the addition. Great flavor combination!!  I halved the recipe (I eyeballed amts since I didn&#039;t know how to convert &amp; half without making my brain hurt..haha) and it made almost a cup. I used some of it to mix with mayo and put that mixture onto some toasted chicken sandwiches. Yummy! Made for Culinary Quest, Italy region, for the International Agents of QUEST."
542159,326910,2014-08-24,5,"Pesto yum, sun-dried tomatoes yum, pesto made using sun-dried tomatoes yummy yum yum. I used this to make pesto chicken and it was wonderful. Do be careful with the garlic my cloves were very big and 8 was just the right amount. I am already planning to make this again. Thanks for the post."
266635,326910,2018-03-08,5,"Made this delicious pesto to go with some pasta tonight. Halved the amounts, but had to tweak the ingredients a bit as I'm not quite sure what a bunch of basil looks like exactly. I ended up adding extra sundried tomatoes, pine nuts and parmesan and it turned out really nice. I used some of the sundried tomato oil in addition to the olive oil."
123897,101371,2005-05-03,5,"I made this recipe in a smaller scale and used cornflour as the starch component.  However, I use 1 tsp per cup of flour. It has never failed me before. "
190230,101371,2005-07-29,5,"I haven't made this, but bless you for putting this on here.  The aluminum thing freaked me out when I heard about it years ago, and since then I have used Clabber Girl Aluminum-free.  I'm almost out, so I will try and do this!  Thank you!"
56061,101371,2007-04-13,5,"I was looking for a baking powder substitute in a pinch.  After trying this recipe, I won't purchase baking powder and will just use this recipe.  Like Velvetinenut, I also substituted corn starch and decreased the amount used by 1/2 and it worked well.  Many thanks, Missy Wombat."
1351570,101371,2010-10-11,5,"This is great. It works like a dream, better than any store bought I've used. THANKS!"
606850,101371,2010-11-25,5,"I'm very sensitive to the taste of baking powder, so I'm always looking for baking powder alternatives, including Bakewell Cream.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for a baking powder recipe WITH the chemical function!  I had some Bakewell Cream (sodium acid pyrophosphate), and although the bag said ""use in place of baking powder"" I made the worst buttermilk biscuits (which makes sense now that I've read the Wikipedia entry on baking powder, it had excess acid).  BUT now that I've made baking powder, mixing the sodium acid pyrophosphate with baking soda and cornstarch (or you can use less ""baking powder"" and omit the filler), my biscuits are tasty again!<br/><br/>This is a winner on two fronts: I can now use that Bakewell Cream for good results, and the results taste better than any another baking powder I've tried!"
211184,354957,2009-03-28,4,These made for a yummy little snack! The only suggestion I would have for next time is to cut the asparagus into smaller pieces. The nice thing about this recipe is you can make as many or as few as you like for a quick snack or appetizer. *Made for PAC Spring 2009*
37305,258574,2007-10-22,4,"I used this so far on string beans and it really jazzed them up.  I'm not sure what we'll try it on next (maybe carrots or even mashed potatoes), but it's nice to know it's in the fridge and I can experiment with it on different things.  Thanks!"
286566,258574,2011-07-04,5,"A lovely fresh herbed butter (I used fresh parsley and sweet basil from the garden) though didn't add the hot sauce or paprika (otherwise may have had problems with the DM eating) - from a half mix I got just over 1/2 cup (so thing serving size needs to be upped to 1 cup) and I spread some over half a wholegrain baguette and put under the grill/broiler for about 10 minutes to crispt up, delicious as a side to recipe #181365 and recipe #54006"
1145611,18068,2009-12-27,4,"this is a yummy and quick dish that is easy to make. it is missing something tho. i added a lil cinnamon, but it still needs something. also, i think bartlett pears are great to use for this. 
thanks for this easy and tastey recipe!"
63128,53235,2005-05-15,4,"I used more than the wasabi called for (and it was restaurant quality) but it seemed to disappear in the pan. When the onions were done, I tasted it and I ended up adding soy sauce and more wasabi--that did the trick! Next time I'll try making a paste of soy sauce and wasabi and frying the onions in that, so it sticks. The flavor combination is yummy--like sushi without the fish. Would be nice served over rice."
322548,53235,2006-09-23,4,"I used a paste made from wasabi powder for this dish and made it up using a little soy sauce. The onions were delicious but a little salty, next time I will try using sweet soy. I used missy preferred method of no oil and It worked fine, I let mine cook down until they were getting sticky and burnt yum! "
62982,47677,2002-12-02,5,"         PA DUTCH RECEIPE
This receipe was used when you had a stommy ache.
 But instead of rites crackers you used saltine crackers and added sugar and cinnamon, no butter."
116962,47677,2003-12-12,5,Growing up in Lancaster County Pa. my mom made stewed crackers at my dad's request. We usually had them at suppertime instead of potaoes..  and instead of Ritz or saltines she always used English water crackers. Yummy!!!
98919,47677,2006-11-06,5,This was so satisfying...I loved it!!  Thanks for sharing!!
424564,47677,2007-01-07,5,This is a very old recipe my mother made this when some one was ill how ever to this day my brother who is 50 years old ask for this when ever he sees me.  Believe it or not very tasty.
2462323,47677,2012-10-22,0,"My mom always made cracker stew with saltines. We always had it for breakfast food, I have made it for my sons on cool/wet weather mornings, and they love it as much as I did. Great comfort food!!!! I still make it and I actually get cravings for it."
553315,47677,2015-08-07,0,"We called this &quot;fried crackers&quot;.  My grandmother made it with oyster crackers, but my Mom made it with saltines.  I still make it from time to time.  Such a great comfort food"
220020,47677,2017-09-19,3,"My mother would make this for my father a couple times a year. But, she just used hot water. She called it Steamed Crackers. Otherwise, it was the same thing. When he didn't feel well, he'd make himself milk toast. This was on the table with our dinner. I've actually never tried it."
302961,226419,2007-08-21,5,"This was outstanding.  Best ""nana puddin'"" I have had since my mother passed away.  This recipe is a keep in my families mind. 

Thanks for posting"
1138236,226419,2011-01-15,5,"This was so good! Nx time I'd figure on half the sugar, 1.5 X's the pudding part or use a smaller dish. I'm not used to such sweetness! I like it warm, but the guys liked it better cooled..."
98016,160705,2006-05-27,5,"Made this as written with the exception of roasting the garlic along with the eggplant.  This was really yummy, and we ate it with a sliced toasted baguette.  "
238364,160705,2007-02-13,5,"We've been making this forever :) it's soooo yummy!!!!

I have this with potatoes, on toast, on chicken...it goes with everything"
118373,160705,2007-05-25,5,"Tastes really good, especially when left overnight in fridge to marinate and blend the flavors. Baked the eggplant for about 1&1/2 hrs for it to be sufficiently soft. Thank you for delecious recipe."
101823,187790,2006-09-27,5,"I have been baking my bacon for some time.  The proper time for my oven is about 15 minutes at 325.  If I use 350 or higher, the bacon begins to burn.  This is great for busy mornings, as it allows your attention to go to the rest of breakfast prep, or even a quick shower while the bacon cooks."
138622,187790,2006-12-10,5,"We adjusted the recipe for approx 8 servings ( about 2 lbs of bacon ) broken up between 2 baking trays . The oven was set to a pre-heated 350 for 25 minutes. I like my bacon crisp DH likes it sort of "" mushy "" . This method made a nice middle ground between the two. This is how we are going to be doing bacon from now on :)"
35526,187790,2007-01-01,5,This is a perfect way to get a bunch of bacon done with minimal mess and an excellent result.  No more spattering grease for me!!
189280,187790,2007-01-16,5,"I love this method of cooking bacon! One pound of thick sliced bacon will fit on one large cookie sheet.  I followed another reviewer and baked at 350 for 25-30 minutes; however, I pulled it out at about 20 minutes, drained off the fat, rearranged the slices as necessary, then put it back in for the remaining time."
173314,187790,2007-08-21,5,Did 8 oz. of bacon on aluminum foil line cookie sheet and was perfect in 20 minutes at 375 degrees. Great mess free way to do bacon!
305147,187790,2007-09-16,5,"I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this yet--perfect bacon, one pound at a time, then I freeze it and use as needed.  Absolutely a breeze!"
267323,187790,2007-10-12,5,Iâ€™ve been cooking bacon this way for years and really like the fact that it is â€œno-fussâ€�.  The only thing I do differently is to put cooling racks on the jellyroll pan then lay the bacon on top of that.  This keeps the bacon above the fat while itâ€™s cooking.
126104,187790,2007-10-14,5,"I used to bake my bacon all the time when I was making quiches, but hadn't made one (until today) for ages.  I had forgotten the oven temp (thought it was lots lower) and time, so I thought I would try this.  I worked out perfect.

I put in 4-5 slices of bacon, but NOT overlapping any.  I left ALL the bacon grease in the lasagna dish, and put the other half of the bacon in to bake.  It worked out just like I wanted, and with much less mess than a frying pan (other than a lasagna dish to clean out).  Thanks, CharlotteJ, for your recipe."
312208,187790,2007-12-20,5,Perfect bacon - FINALLY!  I've always dreaded cooking bacon on the stove because I find the results so random.  Tried this last weekend for a bunch of bacon I was using for a salad and the finished product was perfection.  I didn't use any additional oil and *did* overlap to fit all the bacon on my cookie sheet.  I will never cook bacon on the stove again!  Thank you!
124190,187790,2007-12-25,3,"This was very handy for Christmas morning. I used regular grocery store bacon, just one pack. My bacon was not cooked in the time stated, even with preheating the pan. Not really a big deal, but I had timed everything else around the bacon being done in 25 minutes. I did end up crisping the bacon in the microwave, because I just didn't have any more time. I loved that I didn't get popped and burned, and I will definitely use this recipe again, but will up the time. Thanks!"
303427,187790,2008-01-07,5,"I thought this bacon was OUTSTANDING! My husband had 4 slices left of the grocery store packaged bacon ripped into 8 halves and I baked it 20 minutes on the first side, 5 on the other side. It worked perfectly! The bacon came out fully cooked, crisp but still nice, pretty thick, and with a juicy and very bacon-y taste! :)  Also, I made it on an aluminum pan so there was no mess to clean up at all! It made for a wonderful compliment to my breakfast this morning and I'm so thankful for this recipe! It's a keeper I will definitely use again in the near future! Thank you!"
515818,187790,2008-01-17,5,"Im a ""beginning cook"" (never cooked anything before i married in june '06).   I avoid cooking bacon because i can never get it right, its all soggy and floppy, the grease splatters me and HURTS..etc etc.. its kinda hit or miss.   I decided to try this with some leftover frozen bacon.  I de-thawed the bacon, then just layered it on my cookie pan (didn't overlap or anything, no extra oil).   I dont (yet!) know what ""convection"" oven means - i just have a new flat-top electric stove.  I preheated to 375F, popped in the bacon for 20 mins, drained at 20, flipped, and cooked for 7 more minutes.  Then i took them out and layed them out on a napkin covered plate to drain.  I must say this is PERFECT!!  Im so excited...even had to call my mom about it (haha).  I will ALWAYS cook my bacon like this now - its so easy and tastes great!  Good, bacon'y and crispy..just like it should be!  THANKS!! :)"
460301,187790,2008-01-26,5,"Loved the fact the stovetop was clear to make other things. This worked well for me. I baked one pound of bacon at 325 for 20 minutes, perfect! Thanks Charlotte J!"
38643,187790,2008-02-03,5,Love the idea of making bacon in the oven.
504487,187790,2008-02-20,5,Fantastic! Trust Charlotte- watch your bacon after you flip it- it burns easily. I will pay better attention next time. Thanks
464080,187790,2008-02-25,5,"This is how I have cooked bacon ever since I found it in Betty Crocker's cookbook.  NO GREASY MESS!!!!  I cook thicker bacon at 400 degreesas per the cookbook, but thin to regular bacon does well at 350 degrees."
6651,187790,2008-03-02,5,I rarely make bacon because I hate cleaning up the splatter of grease on the stove.  This made preparation a cinch!  The bacon turned out perfect -- Thanks!
346387,187790,2008-03-29,5,"I used to grill my bacon on the George Forman grill because I hated cooking bacon on the stove.  the GF grill works great but now that I have 2 hungry kids, it take FOREVER to fry up a pack of bacon!  (My 11 yr old son would eat an entire pack of bacon if I let him!)  Anyway, this is a great way to cook the bacon all at once,  pieces stay flat and evenly cooked.  In fact I have a pan in the oven right now!  Soon my family will wake to the smell of bacon and it will be already cooked and ready to go :)  THANKS FOR THE GREAT IDEA!"
107651,187790,2008-04-03,5,"A super easy way to prepare bacon whether it is for 100 or 2 people!! I made some this morning and it was done in no time and no messy cleanup!!

254614,187790,2008-08-27,5,"Excellent! I can not have crisp bacon. I had a trac(a breathing tube in my throat, years ago) I have a ledge in my throat so crisp anything doesn't go down well. I cook until tender done and very limp. Then I freeze between wax paper and finish cooking as needed. Or chop and use in other recipes. I cook for 325* This is a good recipe and the bacon doesn't shrink and if you want to add lemon pepper to the slices, you can, it won't fall off and...when the bacon is almost cooked, you can brush on a little melted honey. Yummmm!
Thanks for posting! This is super!"
88099,187790,2008-08-31,5,What a great way to make a large amount of bacon.  Mine took about 30 minutes and it truned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing.
25177,187790,2008-09-02,5,I started preparing my bacon this way when my daughters were in school. I cook it until it is almost done and then drain it on paper towels. I then place it in a container with waxed paper in between the slices and place it in the freezer. I take out however many slices I need and place them in the microwave for about 1 minute. Bacon for breakfast even on school days!
369715,187790,2008-09-03,5,I only made a pound of bacon and I cooked this on the grill instead of the oven. This worked perfectly and I had a pound of bacon done all at once.
601015,187790,2008-11-14,4,"I too have discovered baking bacon, and now won't consider making it any other way.  But I'll add one little tip to this method- try placing a cookie cooling rack on the top of a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil. The fat drips away and the clean up couldn't be easier.  Finally, I like to add fresh ground black pepper before it goes into the oven, and always get uncured or applewood smoked bacon (TJ's is a great source). I can get a dozen slices done on the first pass, and then while the oven is hot will throw in a second batch- otherwise there would never be leftovers!  BLTs are a snap!!"
226294,187790,2008-11-25,5,This recipe has saved my life numerous times!  Fantastic results!

It certainly is easy and quick!  I wouldn't have even bought bacon if I hadn't read you could bake it like this.  =P"
52317,187790,2009-01-20,5,"I've been baking bacon for over 30 years--thanks to having married a chef. It is important to ""know"" your oven--the temperature and time may vary from the recipe. I drain the bacon half-way through the baking, and turn the bacon once. This cuts down on the spatters inside the oven. Not having to clean the cook top and the six feet surrounding it is great!"
726484,187790,2009-03-15,5,"Why on earth did I ever make bacon any other way????? Thank you for the method, I wish I had tried this YEARS ago. Pan frying is painful and messy, and microwaving yields awful results. Your method is the way I will cook bacon from now on, and will teach my daughters to do the same. I lined the cookie sheet with foil, clean up was a breeze. The next time I will follow the suggestions of others and put the bacon on a rack over the cookie sheet. Regardless, this was easy, and I thank you so much for posting! :)"
65502,187790,2009-04-11,5,I used to make bacon like this at a hotel when I was in a cooking program and I've never really bothered to make them like this at home. We did today and it was great. The bacon looks so good too! I only cooked 12 slices though! I cooked them on parchment paper and had no clean-up. Thanks!
180087,187790,2009-04-12,5,I always burn the bacon at the last minute.  This method has renewed my love affair with bacon!  Thank you from the bottom of my aortic.
141904,187790,2009-04-25,2,"I just couldn't get my bacon to cook right.  Maybe it was me -- maybe it was the bacon.  My hysband got REALLY thick stuff.  It took FOREVER to cook.  And, ultimately, would have been faster to fry on a griddle.  Of course, (eventually... after almost an hour) it IS bacon -- so I can't give too low of a rating!  :)  I will try again some other time ... when I have more time."
219865,187790,2009-05-18,5,"We loved cooking bacon this way, it turned out fabulous, I cooked it at 400 for 15 minutes, drained, and cooked 15 minutes longer, it turned out nice and crispy, just how we like it, and there was no splatter mess to clean up either. I think we'll always cook bacon this way. Thanks so much!"
329333,187790,2009-07-10,5,Baking bacon is the only way to go.  I suggest lining the baking pan with parchment paper.  That way you don't have to drain since the parchment absorbs a lot of the grease.  Cooking time was spot on for me @ 375 since my oven runs about 25 degrees hot.
1187622,187790,2009-09-21,5,My son will not eat micro bacon anymore.  Calls it fake bacon.  Found this recipe and crossed my finger.  Yippee!   I no longer have to fry bacon for him each morning before school.   I can smell like perfume and soap instead of bacon all day.   Made it just the way it states and it turned out perfect.  I did line my pans with foil.    No more frying bacon for me.  Thanks for posting.
601227,187790,2009-10-03,5,"I love the fact that there is no greasy mess and I can make a bunch of bacon at a time without standing over a frying pan for a half an hour or so. Great idea!! Oh, and lining the pan with foil is a must do. Thanks..."
1397030,187790,2009-10-03,5,I like this recipe! This is similar to mine exept I use oil becuase it has a sort of more smokey/crunchy taste great recipe and I love bacon hahahahhaa
168462,187790,2009-10-05,5,I lined my pan with foil so cleanup was easy. The timing on this recipe was almost perfect. It was easy with no fuss. Thanks for the recipe.
714468,187790,2009-10-20,5,"Love making bacon this way!  Saves so having to clean my gas cooktop, which is a big plus."
543352,187790,2009-10-27,5,Yummy!!! This is the only way I cook the bacons! They are always nicely done and crispy...
108460,187790,2009-11-10,5,Mmmm good!  Mine took about 30 minutes at 375; and I cooked a whole package of thick sliced bacon and sprinkled brown sugar on it as suggested by another review.
165933,187790,2009-12-07,5,"Can't believe that I haven't reviewed this yet, well maybe I can....I use the parchment paper every time for easy clean up and love the way the house doesn't smell of fried bacon.  Thank you."
363055,187790,2010-02-22,5,Excellent.....no more grease burns on my arms!!!
844554,187790,2010-03-29,5,This is the only way to cook bacon from now on. No splatters and SO easy!! Thanks.
560300,187790,2010-04-30,5,yum.
213139,187790,2010-11-18,5,What an easy way to prepare bacon! I scaled this back to one package and loved that I didn't have a greasy mess to clean up.  Thanks for posting this Charlotte ~ I may never fry bacon again!  Made for Zaar Stars Tag.
15521,187790,2010-11-21,5,"Worked perfectly!  I used this in a recipe where the bacon needed to be done, but not crispy.  I cooked it for 10 minutes and it was just right!"
936601,187790,2011-02-13,5,"This is by far the best way to cook bacon!  I used parchment paper as some of the other reviews suggested.  Clean-up was a breeze, and I didn't have to worry about anyone getting splattered while the bacon was cooking!"
248647,187790,2011-04-12,5,Awesome! I hate frying bacon. It's always so greasy and messy. This was so easy and probably a little bit more healtheir than just pan frying. I didn't use the oil bc I knew it would make it's own grease. I will be making this again. What a great idea :)
1005502,187790,2011-05-08,5,"I've done bacon this way several times now, and will NEVER fry bacon again!  Comes out perfectly every time and my husband and kids love that it's never overcooked or undercooked.  Aside from the fact that you don't get splatters and your house doesn't smell of bacon all day!  The best way to cook bacon by far!"
364211,187790,2011-05-23,5,"Made using Williams thick sliced bacon.  Sprayed bottom of broiler pan with pam, fit 9 slices of bacon and cooked in a 375 degree preheated oven for 20 minutes. I drained the grease, turned over the bacon and cooked for 5 minutes more.  Made 2 batches for freezing leftovers.   Perfect for thick sliced bacon.  I soaked the broiler pan in warm water for a few minutes and it cleaned up easily. Delicious, thank you Charlotte J, for posting."
183964,187790,2011-08-11,0,Delicious! I baked at 375° for 15 minutes in a an ordinary 13x9 baking sheet lined with foil to catch the grease. <br/><br/>I didn't turn the bacon or drain any grease away... the bacon was perfect after sitting on some newspaper to drain away the fat for 15 minutes. <br/><br/>This makes perfect bacon for a BLT sandwich.
98919,187790,2012-04-13,5,This is how I always make bacon now.  It lays flat so there is no curling and it is just so much easier than trying to fry it in a skillet.
140132,187790,2012-06-19,5,"Worked like a charm.  I love cooking bacon this way, less splatter on me.  Thank you for sharing this method with us."
1801322124,187790,2013-12-25,1,"Perfect recipe for the person who loves cleaning.  What a mess.  Sure the baking sheet beneath the bacon is easy to clean but what about the rest of the oven.   The bacon fat splatters everywhere.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I guess it&#039;s fine if you have the money to pay somebody else to clean your kitchen, otherwise I&#039;d stick with more conventional methods."
176615,187790,2014-07-13,5,"Worked well! Used a pound of regular bacon on a half sheet pan covered with parchment paper and baked as directed. Perfect bacon, easy clean up. Thanks for the recipe!"
655199,187790,2014-07-15,5,I&#039;ve been cooking bacon in the oven for years. It brings out the best flavor!!!
177350,187790,2015-02-08,5,"I have used this method for years, and we enjoy perfect bacon each time. I like to sprinkle on a little brown sugar, and some fresh cracked black pepper, prior to baking. To the individual that complained about spattering and clean up, bacon by its very nature will make some mess, whether in oven or stove top. I find if you bake it at 375"
1802189004,187790,2015-10-22,5,"OMG! Bacon heaven!! I used a medium priced, thick slice bacon, twelve slices. I followed other reviews and added cracked pepper. I also sprinkled on some organic coconut palm sugar. I was nervous about burning so I started with 15 minutes. Took bacon out of oven and turned over. I added 10 minutes to the timer. I checked every few minutes at this point (very important). Some pieces looked done sooner than others so I removed them to a plate. I put the rest back in and kept checking until all looked done. I put bacon on a plate lined with paper towels and blotted off as much grease as possible. I actually think the bacon shriveled less than with using the skillet and wow, my kind of cleanup!! I believe the 375 degree oven temperature, thick bacon and constant monitoring is the key. YUM!!"
2001389168,187790,2017-02-12,5,One addition I do is use cooling racks with nonstick spray to elevate the bacon above the grease. And no need to flip the bacon.
2000610093,187790,2017-08-20,0,Ty... I used a broiler pan so the fat could drip down... crispy
2001905312,187790,2018-01-01,0,"Followe the recipe but mine did not come out crispy, had to increase heat and time."
611302,187790,2018-06-11,0,"Baked bacon on rimmed, lined baking sheet. Baked for 30 minutes and it turned out perfect!"
526666,279583,2009-09-22,5,"This was so good; why didn't I think of it?! The italian dressing on top added a lovely flavor! I did use fresh basil, as that is what I had oh hand. I served with pizza sauce on the side. Nice lunch; I'll definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing, Sherrybeth."
358513,279583,2009-09-25,5,very yummy quick lunch. I liked the italian twist on the quesadilla. I used flavored tortilla because that's what I had on hand and served with Kalamat olives. Thanks Sherrybeth. Made for Footbal Tag 09.
52282,130688,2005-08-07,5,"this was delicious! 3 of us polished it off in minutes, and the other 2 broke their diets to do so. i used pinto beans to hold the crust down.
then i used at least 1/2 lb of chhese, my dogs loved the rinds. i used 1/2 lb pencil thin asparagus, wonderful snack/appetizer!"
56498,130688,2006-05-30,5,"OUTSTANDING FLAVOR!!  I have never had a recipe knock my socks off before but this one did.  I truly enjoyed every bite of this and so did my DH.  I loved the delicate buttery flavor of the puff pastry, the richness of the brie and the fresh taste of the asparagus.  My taste buds were singing in delight.  This is the type of recipe that reminds you why you joined Zaar in the first place...to find little recipe gems like this one.  I ended up using 2 types of brie, I used a double cream and a triple cream brie.  I think next time I will just use the triple cream.  Also, I used a rosemary infused olive oil to brush the asparagus with and that just pushed it over the top.  The ONLY thing I did differently was that I added some carmelized onions on top of the brie.  I wish I could give this recipe five-hundred stars because it certainly does deserve it.  I can’t wait to make this again…and again and again!!!!!!  Thank you so much for posting this EXCELLENT recipe.          "
251295,130688,2010-02-16,5,I made this for the 2010 Super Bowl Party. What a beautiful dish to serve!!  My DM usually loves the brie en croute kind of appetizer and this did it one better.  She was impressed as was I in how it came out looking exactly like the picture.  I especially liked the edges and might next time...and there will be a next time...to NOT join the puff pastry together and leave it in long thirds.  I will experiment further but hands down this was a wonderful recipe that is well deserved of the 5 stars I have given it!!!  Thank you.
2000431901,130688,2016-12-28,0,This was pretty good. I'd add more cheese next time.
1019994,130688,2017-05-19,4,"This made a great side to go with steaks, knocking out the vegie and starch portion of the meal with one dish. It also had a bit of an ohh and ahh factor when I threw it on the table intact before cutting it into segments with a pizza cutter."
37449,276220,2008-02-13,4,Mmmmm...mmmm! Nice mild and slightly sweet dish that I thoroughly enjoyed. Thanks! Made for the Beverage tag game.
954555,276220,2008-09-28,4,"Yummmmyyyyy!!!  This is absalutly great,nice for an evening spent among friends.  I do one simlar to this , but this is healther,  and not as greasy.  My complements to the chef!!!!!!!!!"
1803441505,276220,2014-11-30,5,This looked a little intimidating but was quite easy to do. I&#039;ll be making this more.often !
2310,140769,2006-02-19,4,"We love a good vegetable curry and this is certainly in that category.  I only had 1/2 a cabbage in my fridge, so cut down the whole recipe accordingly for just my DH and I.  Then I decided to saute the cabbage in a large pot with the onions instead of boiling them. I have both hot and sweet curry powder and opted for the spicey version, giving this dish a great tongue tingling flavor.  We enjoyed this curry with a handful of plumped raisins, some toasted sliced almonds, all served over hot brown rice.  Healthy and delicious!!
I always trust your recipes, Rita!"
199848,140769,2006-08-30,5,"Super!  These veggies come togther wonderfully.  The only thing I added was a little salt.  I used a mild curry powder.  Also, I didn't boil my cabbage wedges first; I simply added them when I added the carrots and potatoes, so the cabbage still had a little crunch to it.  I'll make this again for sure.  Thanx for posting!"
340141,140769,2011-05-27,4,"Excellent flavor and perfect timing on the vegetables in order to keep them al dente and not mushy.  I did have to add about 3/4 cup more water, however, to keep the sauce from sticking.  I would wonder if I had the heat too high, but the vegetables were perfectly al dente with the recipe's timing, so I don't know what the story might be.  After the curry had been added, I started using a lid.   I also added another tablespoon of butter because the local restaurant makes them very buttery and deleted the potatoes entirely and used an entire small head of cauliflower; halved the carrots.  This is one of my two very absolute favorite ways to eat caulflower--makes it so painless.   I wil definitely use this recipe again.  ZWT7"
593927,500043,2013-05-08,4,"Tasty. DD1 (5 years old) loved it!!! It was a soft egg experience. I would say this is 4 servings. I used an extra free range egg because they were on the smaller side. I used organic onions and tomatoes, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and the dried mint which was neat. Made for My Food Odyssey - Afghanistan"
89831,264484,2007-12-14,5,"This is simply wonderful, not sure if I would call it eggnog it is more like banana flavored shake, we enjoyed this, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:)"
451700,40478,2008-07-14,5,"This is a FANTASTIC recipe and I'm surprised it hasn't been reviewed yet! Very very simple and so easy to make! I pricked the bottom of the puff pastry with a fork leaving about half an inch border on all sides so that the centre wouldn't 'puff up' during baking. I didn't bother with the butter but sprinkled some cinnamon and used demerara sugar instead of regular sugar (and I am sure I didn't use 1/2 cup, I sprinkled it on top as to our liking). Next time, I think I shall glaze it with some melted apricot jam after baking. And I served it plain. Thank you, Mini, for sharing this wonderful recipe, I definitely will be making it again! :)"
996264,40478,2008-10-20,5,This is VERY good and totally easy to make!  I didn't have any puff pastry on hand so I substituted pie crust.  Very good.
63858,40478,2008-10-25,5,I made this for dessert tonight.  I used a variety of apples and glazed with an apple jelly glaze I made.  This was simple and delicious.
513230,40478,2010-03-01,5,"Wow, I will be making this recipe very often. It is so delicious and easy to put together. No major prep work or anything. Did make a change to the recipe - I used brown sugar and added some ground cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to the apples. Otherwise, wow amazing! I made my own quick puff pastry recipe for this and yes! I need to buy more apples. Awesome recipe. Thanks for posting."
40576,123513,2005-08-15,2,"Maybe it was my cheese powder; maybe it was me, but this just didn't thicken up even to the 'blue box' stage.  I wound up having to put a slice of regular cheese in to thicken it somewhat so it wasn't soup.  We still had to eat it in bowls.

I was excited because I was looking for something new to do with my cheese powder.

It did have a fairly nice flavor, but then again, cheese and pasta just can't help it.

Thanks for the recipe, but this won't be added to my arsenal.  Sorry."
160497,123513,2005-09-15,5,"This was great!  My kids wanted me to make more immediately.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great, not too runny.  I know there are several cheese powders available, I used cheddar cheese powder available at our local bulk food store."
201581,336725,2010-04-04,5,"I love deviled eggs and this simple recipe tastes great. I used part of my batch of Easter eggs to make 8 egg halves. I loved the combination of flavors, Thanhs for posting Stacie Lora! Made for PAC Spring 2010."
275893,31685,2006-01-11,4,"These are good cookies, very easy, and inexpensive.  I used vanilla cake mix.  And I added a handful of both chopped walnets, and peanut butter chips."
290529,31685,2006-02-05,4,"so very easy, and can be made great nuts-chocolate chips -frosting what ever"
118684,31685,2006-04-11,4,"Easy, i made into bar cookies for a cookie cake.
"
345569,31685,2009-02-17,4,"This was very easy to make -- I just don't like the smell of baking cake mixes!  I used margarine to keep it non-dairy.  I couldn't drop them on the cookie sheet by spoonfuls, either; it was much to thick.  I had to roll them into balls, which I then rolled in colored nonpareils.  They LOOKED pretty, at least!  Thanks for posting."
42986,31685,2010-06-27,5,very delicious. i used a yellow cake mix and then threw in some chocolate pieces. because the base is a cake mix it makes the cookies maintain their moist-ness. i'm going to make the next batch from chocolate cake mix and throw in some peanut butter chips :).
2001550114,31685,2017-05-23,5,"SO EASY!! And so good! I used BC Chocolate Fudge 'cause that's all I had left in the pantry and I wanted to try this recipe...used butter not margarine...had no problems getting the batter to drop of the spoon onto the cookie sheets. 20 minutes later, cooled and they were appreciated by my family! Thanks so much for posting this! --Jean D"
166642,296334,2008-11-10,5,This is delicious! I love the addition of romano cheese with this. It was so easy and my family enjoyed it with an Italian dish. Thanks for sharing! Made for My 3 Chefs.
526666,296334,2009-07-26,5,"This could not have been better! The combination of tastes was an explosion in my mouth! Sorta reminded me of the lovely Italian restaurants where they serve the bread with seasoned oil for dipping, only toasted, therefore, better! I'll be making this again, and sharing with my friends! Thanks for sharing, Jackie!"
383346,296334,2009-08-18,5,I used parmesan cheese instead of the romano cheese.  This is a wonderful recipe.  Thanks Jackie :)  Made for Holiday tag.
1072593,296334,2009-09-11,5,I'm certifiable.   Certifiably in love with basil.  Made for Everyday Is A Holiday.
59473,75366,2004-05-24,5,"This was very good. I chopped red, green, peppers and onions. I placed them on foil and drizzled this over them. I wrapped them up and cooked them on the barbecue. I think next time I will experiment with different herbs and spices. Thanks"
209255,75366,2006-07-14,5,"Wonderful!  I made this today and my house smells like a garlic paradise!  I love garlic but my fiance does not.  Using this, I can now add garlic to lots more things!  He is going to hate it!  lol  The first thing I did with this is used it to make Tomato Bruschetta Recipe #94084.  Instead of using just plain oil, I used this!  DIVINE!  I am so glad I made this.  I had a head and a half of garlic to use up before it went bad... so that worked out to 17 cloves.  Perfect.  One thing I found out though was that when the recipe says to turn the stove low, it means low.  I have a gas stove and it doesn't go overly low.  The oil and the garlic was starting to burn because the flame was too high.  So I grabbed the guard from the other burner and put it on top of the one I was using and put the pan on top of that.  That worked great.  There were only little bubbles after that and I think that is what was needed.  I will be putting this into my permanent recipe book.  Thanks for yet another winner Sharon!"
992845,75366,2009-12-24,5,"Yummmmm, the oil is just as delish as the cloves nice smokey flavor. I added 1T of rice vinegar to every cup of oil to ward of botulism. Thanks, this is a keeper!"
226863,75366,2011-04-28,5,"Wonderful!  I've used it with asparagus, broccoli, and turkey burgers so far!  Thanks for sharing!"
527607,75366,2014-05-28,5,"Just a wonderful way to keep garlic and get garlic flavored oil.  I took the advice of a tbs of vinegar to ward of botulism and plan to keep it all the time just refreshing it. I also suggest preparing two burners if you have electric, one on lowest setting and one to bring to a boil.  It takes a long time for the burner to get low enough to stop the boil otherwise."
571743,77315,2007-12-26,5,Used this glaze on my Christmas Ham and got rave reviews from family and friends.  I also had some dried apricots and cherries that I diced very small and put in the pot.  When I reduced my sauce they worked perfectly.  I will use this glaze on more than just ham in the future.  Thanks Kitten.
489929,77315,2009-08-01,0,"I will rate this when I use apricot.

I used orange... it's all I had and I didn't use the cornstarch...  I now know why you baste it at the end.  Ooops.  ;O)  

Very good...  I didn't use the cornstarch I will next time.  I can't wait to make this during Christmas...  great aroma... and way easy."
266635,486438,2013-05-27,4,I wanted a non-traditional potato salad for our holiday lunch and this dish was very tasty.  I did add more bacon and a little more s &amp; p.  I think next time I might add some additional spices to the dressing just to jazz it up a bit more.  Overall we really enjoyed it and it went well with our other sides and grilled entree.
135887,385071,2009-09-06,4,"I love the concept of these.  Made as directed, I thought they lacked in flavor.  Will make again but need to think of a way to punch them up a bit."
43083,70049,2003-10-30,5,"MMMM! This was great. I used turkey, only 1 can of beans, and everything else as is. Doused in shredded cheese. Very meaty and not too spicy. I loved it! Of course I'm in FL and its 80 outside but in winter I will definitely be making this alot more!"
28649,70049,2003-11-04,4,This was very easy to make.  I did use 2 pounds of ground round and only 1 can of beans.  I also doubled up on the tomato sauce because of the extra meat.  This cooks up quickly and great for a last minute meal. Thanks Rick.
305531,385071,2009-08-16,5,"Yum! These are fun, simple, and tasty. I wasn't sure the best way to get them out of the muffin tin, so inverted them onto a baking sheet. Some of them came out fine, but some stuck a little more. The ones that wouldn't come out right away, I let sit for about 5 minutes and used a knife to loosen them up a bit. Very tasty, but think I need to work on presentation a little more, lol. Thanks diner for a fun side dish. Made for NKOTB Tag.  BTW - these are good cold too!"
522275,385071,2009-08-20,5,"Delicious and so easy!  I only had red potatoes and cheddar, but it was still wonderful and my family gobbled it up.  I greased my muffin pan with butter instead of spray and used a knife to loosen the gratins from the pan -- worked great!  Thanks for sharing her recipe with us.  I'm looking forward to using it again with other cheeses.  :)"
88378,385071,2009-08-21,5,"I've made these several times since she won Next Food Network Star.  I like to use jumbo-sized muffin tins and pack them pretty tightly with potatoes, placing the potatoes around the sides of each cup as well as stacking them.  I also like mozzarella cheese better than Swiss.  I like very finely chopped red onion, and for the cream I just put a tablespoon into each cup.  I salt, pepper, onion and cheese them as I build them (not just on top.)  I also bake them longer to get them crunchy around the edges.  These potatoes are so good we could fight over them!!  Fabulous recipe!"
905569,385071,2009-08-24,5,"I've made these 3 times since she won and love them!!  So many possible combinations.  I salt & pepper each side of each slice of potatos and sometimes add garlic powder too.  Like vivmom, I also pack them tightly around the sides.  Trying to use up the chives from my herb garden, so I've been placing them in each layer, along w/ nacho/monterrey jack shredded cheese and occasionally some bacon pieces.  Fantastic!!"
780064,385071,2009-08-29,5,as easy as it sounds and delicious!
161265,385071,2009-08-30,5,Loved these!  I used my regular sized muffin tins and filled all 12 of them up AND still didn't use all the potato (maybe I had a too big tater!).  Next time I'll use a jumbo sized muffin tin.  Very tasty!  And easy too.
869532,385071,2009-09-01,5,I fell in love with this easy and delicious recipe the minute I saw Melissa making it on TV. I will make these often. I slice the potatoes with a mandolin. It's also fun to use different cheeses and adding herbs and garlic. Great versatile dish!
766961,385071,2009-09-09,5,"I have been *dying* to use this recipe since I saw her make these.  I finally gave in and used what I had.  I used mozzarella cheese and had to improv with a milk/sour cream mixture.  I also lightly sprinkled a little dried chopped onion.  Thanks for posting this on recipezaar, easier to keep track of!"
779699,385071,2009-10-26,5,These are super! I really loved them! I made four of them (2 of us) and I used swiss = cheddar and I added minced garlic between the layers (we LOVE garlice)! I love all of the different possibilities!!! Thanks for posting! [Made for Holiday Tag October 2009!]
808027,385071,2009-10-27,5,"These are great, and they come together in no time at all.  I love that they are made in muffin tins...great idea.  Full of flavor...you'd expect nothing less from Melissa D'arabian.  Love her!  Thanks for posting this -- you beat me to it.  :-)"
88099,385071,2009-11-13,5,"So good.  I used cheddar cheese for personal preference and cooked mine a little long so they got slightly burned around the edges, but still tasted great.  I used fat-free half & half in place of the cream and it worked well.  Thanks.  Made for Zaar Stars :)"
482933,385071,2009-11-18,5,"Loved the crustiness, taste, and technique!  I made enough for the two of us and divided between regular 8 muffin pan sections and it was done fast-25 minutes but you see that mine were not thick either. I used a spoon to remove and blotted them a bit.  Thanks diner524 for posting.  Am emailing this one out."
168462,385071,2009-11-22,5,"My family really liked these. In anticipation of that and their hearty appetites, I made these in a large pan. I layered the potato, salt pepper, a little garlic powder and cheese and then repeated until I had used up all my potatoes. I did not have heavy cream so I just used skim milk. They  were so popular I made them again the next day. I think they would make a great presentation if made in the muffin tins. Thanks for the recipe."
227978,385071,2009-12-19,5,"These were spectacular gratins.  Easy to prepare, and ready in the exact time noted in the recipe.  I will definitely make these often.  Thanks, Diner.  Yum."
26512,385071,2009-12-26,4,"This was very good. I was sick, didn't feel like fooling with the muffin tins, so I just layered in a casserole dish. It did take longer to cook, obviously and I had to add more salt, but will definitely make again, hopefully in the muffin tins next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
125411,385071,2009-12-27,5,Fabulous. Served with rack of lamb and roasted brussels sprouts.
280271,385071,2010-01-11,5,These are every bit as good as I thought they would be. I used all the ingredients listed with no added spices and DH and I were very impressed with the flavor. I cut the recipe in half and made jumbo muffins. I got 3 nice size servings with my potato. I used the suggestion of putting slices of potato around the muffin cup. I also topped them with additional potato slices. I cooked them for 1 hour and they came out perfect. Crispy on the outside tender on the inside. I decided not to flip them out of the pan but to serve them right side up. This is going in my best of 2010 cookbook. Thanks for posting. :)
960709,385071,2010-02-07,4,"Can't believe I forgot to review this, made it back in November at the deer lease.  We really enjoyed these and it was easy to do.  I did salt and pepper each layer. It was nice to have something that felt a little 'sophisticated' to eat down at the deer lease.  Thanks for posting the recipe."
226863,385071,2010-04-10,0,"I wanted to make this for two, so I halved the recipe and then made it in small gratin bowls.  So I adjusted the cooking time, although I found I really didn't need to.  I did cut my potatoes very thin, so that probably helped in reducing the cooking time.  The taste was wonderful!  I'll do this again....I can make it for just a few people and not have to deal with the leftovers of a big gratin dish!  Thanks for sharing...made for Potluck tag."
128473,385071,2010-05-12,5,"What a lovely recipe diner.  We really enjoyed these quick and easy to make potatoes.  I made in a dish big enough for two.  I adjusted the  ingredients and time accordingly.  These turned out perfectly.  Tender and flavorful. The swiss cheese and sweet onions were a lovely addition. I didn't have any green onions left, so I used vidallias...they were nice in this dish. Thanks so much for sharing a dish I will make again. :)"
171790,385071,2011-02-11,5,These were a hit at dinner tonight. I ended up making 12 because there was too much potato to fit into 8 muffin cups. I grated a bit more cheese and sliced a third green onion for the extra 4 potato gratins. I also didn't end up using 3/4 cup of cream. I just poured a bit over each assembled muffin tin without measuring the amount but I would guess that each muffin tin got a couple of tablespoons of cream. Made for Best of 2010 Tag Game Event.
383346,385071,2012-01-06,5,Me and DH loved this recipe.  It's so easy to do.  We'll be doing it again soon.  I had only mozzarella cheese.  And I added yellow onions.  The taste was fabulous.  And I used 1 tbs of heavy cream in each.  Thanks diner :)  Made for Holiday tag game
286566,385071,2011-04-18,4,"I made these using 1 1/2 cup ceramic oven proof souffle dishes and allowed an hour to cook at 200C (non fan forced oven), I used 3 large nadine potatoes and got 4 layers in my dish.  The drawback in my selection of baking dish is I don't think they browned on the bottom as well as they should have as compared to a metal container so would like to try again using texas muffin pans but overall this dish is quite rich even though I only used a little less than 2 tablespoons of thicken cream per serve but overall an enjoyable potatoe dish.  Thank you diner524, made for Went To Market tag game."
482376,385071,2011-05-11,5,"These were absolutely fabulous! I loved how crispy all the outer edges got. I used shredded parmesan because I'm not a fan of swiss. I think cheddar would be nice, too. The directions were perfect."
649173,385071,2011-05-14,5,"We had these for dinner last night to go with salmon filet and baked beans.  Perfect combination, but would go with any main dish I'm sure.  Had to use Vidalia onion as I was out of green, but they were wonderful with the Vidalias.  Mine stuck to the dish a little, but were still very presentable.  Thanks so much for a tasty treat that I'll be making often. ."
136997,385071,2011-05-20,5,"Easy to assemble and very tasty, I had some smoked provolone that needed to be used up and the flavour was perfect. :)."
1701315,385071,2011-06-17,5,"Wow.  These are so flavorful and so easy!  I used red skin potatoes, and did half with gruyere and half with cheddar.  I salt and peppered each layer and used less than 1 T cream per gratin.  Wonderful, wonderful!"
1058097,385071,2011-06-20,4,"It's a good idea in theory.  They're quite easy, so long as you choose potatoes that are the same size as the muffin tin--otherwise it's a job to fit them in right.  But next time I would not use raw potatoes, although I usually prefer them.  I had to cook them for an hour to cook the potatoes through, and that meant the cheese and onions were scorched.  They still get four stars on flavor alone.  With pre-cooked potatoes, this recipe would probably be perfect."
690623,385071,2011-06-21,5,These were fun to make and had a wonderful taste and presentation!  I was leary because I don't bake much and anticipated a problem with my ancient muffin tins.  I don't use Pam but greased the tins quite heavily and had no trouble turning them out.  Super flavour!  Thanks for posting.  Made for Food.Commandos ~ ZWT 7
66448,385071,2011-06-25,5,"These were absolutely delish!!! I cut it in half for the 2 of us & used custard cups instead of muffin pans, sprayed well with Pam & had no trouble with sticking. I got 4 custard cups & only used 1 baking potato well washed, thinly sliced with skin on. I have 2 left & can't wait to use them up tomorrow with grilled pork chops. What a great recipe so elegant looking, wish I had it when the outlaws came for dinner, would have made a nice impression. I also used gruyere cheese, shredded & topped each cup off with the whipping cream. Will be making these very often."
323186,385071,2011-06-28,5,"This worked very well for me, I had wondered if they would stick but I had no trouble at all, even allowing for old and well-used muffin tins.  I used the coarse side of my grater to roughly slice/grate the raw potatoes, and I used shredded parmesan, not having swiss.  I guess-timated the cream.    They cooked perfectly, tasted Delicious, I'm not a huge potato fan but I do like a creamy potato bake,  and crispy roasted potatoes, I would say that this is the best of both worlds!  Thank you Diner, a keeper!"
852554,385071,2011-06-29,5,"I halved this recipe, except used the same amount of green onions... yummy is all I can say!  Went perfect with the roast chicken we got!"
60260,385071,2011-07-27,5,"I made this recipe ""as is"" but used ramekins vs. a muffin tin.  They turned out well and is great side to just about anything.  Quick and easy.   Will do these again."
1695616,385071,2011-08-06,0,"copy and pasted review from the Food Network website...putting it here for easy reference for me when I get ready to try this out!.....""I've made this five or six times now and love it! The best variation I've tried so far is to dice finely one-half of a large Jalapeno and let it steep in the cream over the heat. Then strain the jalapeno flavored cream over the potatoes and sprinkle the Jalapeno bits on top. Be sure to do at least four layers of thinly sliced potatoes (two or three potatoes per layer and Mexican-blend cheese and overfill the tins slightly because it all compacts during cooking. I've also tried it with thyme-infused cream and other times I've used smoked cheddar, spicy jack, and gruyere cheeses. They were all great! These freeze and reheat nicely, by the way!"""
526666,385071,2011-10-19,5,"This recipe makes a nice presentation, if you feel like your potatoes are boring. I 'shaved' my potato, making the slices as thin as chips. I used a jumbo muffin pan, and filled all 6, making approximately 3-4 layers of potatoes, with cheese sprinkled in between the layers. Hard to believe there is no butter in this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised with how well these turned out. Tasty and crispy, they were devoured! When I want to impress my guests, I will pull out this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing, diner!"
590815,385071,2011-10-24,5,This recipe is really yummy my husband loved it and is very easy to make.
949568,385071,2012-08-08,5,"We had fun with these.  We didn't remove the foil halfway through.  The plus side of that is the potatoes cooked in 35 minutes.  The downside, they were pale and not crusty, and we had to scoop our portion out of the muffin cup at the table.  Taste-wise they were good.  Made for ZWT8 trip to Australia / New Zealand.  Thanks for the fun diner!"
1169750,385071,2014-07-31,5,"Made as directed.  Outstanding!  Slice potatoes wafer thin, use a good variety of swiss cheese and you can&#039;t go wrong."
1803423832,385071,2014-11-27,5,Don&#039;t bother inverting. I run a knife around them when they just come out of oven and then let rest for five to ten mins covered. Just run a small spoon around tin and they pop out. I use gruyere and salt and pepper tops before I spoon on cream. Don&#039;t have to make them that thick either to avoid longer cook times. Delish!!!
400708,385071,2016-07-14,5,"So easy, fast and impressive looking with great taste, what more could you want, using my food processor to slice the potatoes made it even easier, made it exactly as listed and loved it"
227978,498564,2013-08-19,5,"This is positively heavenly, Linky.  We all really enjoyed this great asparagus dish.  It had such a wonderful Asian touch and the garlic salt gave it a nice finish.  I will make this often, especially when fresh asparagus is in abundance at the local farmer&#039;s market.   Made for ZWT #9 (SE Asia)."
107583,498564,2013-08-26,5,"Very easy and very tasty.  I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, because I felt the soy would be salty enough.  Made for ZWT 9."
37449,498564,2013-08-27,5,"I loved this and instead of saving some for my son, ate it all up myself. My bad."
780172,498564,2013-08-28,5,"Simple to make, great Asian taste. I did not add garlic salt, used fresh garlic instead. Made for ZWT9."
1680722,498564,2015-04-13,5,"Enjoyable light vegetables side dish, to delicious to be only a side dish. I roasted the asparagus under the broiler for about 12 minutes as the asparagus were quite long but thin! I loved the chopped garlic on it very much!

We eat this with chicken cooked in the oven and white rice!"
1060667,498564,2016-02-15,4,I think that all the ingredient&#039;s (besides  the asparagus) needs to be mixed together and then poured over the asparagus then tossed around.  Delicious after coming out of the oven...great along side a good Chinese/Asian dish for sure!!
47892,498564,2016-07-18,3,I used one teaspoon regular sesame oil and replaced the olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil. I don't understand the use of garlic salt when both soy sauce and garlic are also included in the ingredient's list so I skipped the garlic salt. *Fresh* ginger in place of ground-significantly fresher taste! Roasted for 15 minutes-but roasting time really depends on the thickness of the stalks. Prepared for CQ 2016.
1925885,498564,2016-07-19,5,"Great recipe for asparagus! Like other reviewers, I thought the garlic salt would be overboard, so I used garlic powder. Glad I did because it was definitely salty enough! We will definitely be making these again! Thanks for posting. Made for CQ3, Team Pi Rho Maniacs."
266635,498564,2016-07-27,5,"We really enjoyed this Asian-flavored asparagus. It really complimented our meal tonight. I used thinner asparagus, so I reduced the heat and lessened the roasting time. Will definitely make them again."
804550,253037,2009-05-17,4,"Very tasty pina colada smoothie! I may try adding vanilla ice cream to it next time to give it more body.
Made for the Alphabet Soup tag game."
286566,253037,2010-12-05,5,"I made this for the DM and she has thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only thing I did differently was to use low fat milk and to use a couple of drops of coconut essense in place of the coconut milk.  Thank you Vchef607, made for ZAAR Chef Alphabet Soup."
1068514,342698,2008-12-11,0,this brownie is so good and chewy i rate is as a 4
1028335,342698,2009-01-06,4,i used part splenda and since i have no mixer i winged it and mixed by hand. still tastes darn good! once i pick up a mixer i'll try again...
36128,44272,2003-02-14,5,These were spectacular little appy's.  I used marinated artichoke hearts.  My hubby and I loved them and the were fast and easy!  THanks so much for contributing to my beautiful Valentines dinner for me and my husband!
9748,44272,2003-03-03,5,A wonderful and easy appetizer!  I doubled it and served it for a dinner party this weekend.  It was a big hit!
158304,44272,2004-09-02,5,These were gobbled up in no time!! Next time I'll be doubling the recipe and maybe I'll actually get to try one!! Thanks for a great recipe!
63128,44272,2008-07-26,3,"I love these ingredients so I was surprised that together they didn't really do much for me.  I wonder if the missing link might be cheese, so I may experiment with that in the future."
1408290,44272,2009-12-13,5,"I love this H'ors d'Oeuvres recipe. It is not only pleasing to the taste buds, but also healthy! Artichokes are low calorie. a One medium Artichoke is an excellent source of fiber and vitamin C, and a good source of folate and magnesium. They are also a great source of disease-fighting antioxidants."
90180,124597,2005-06-11,4,"I'm always looking for a new way to do asparagus and this is a fine choice.  Simple and tasty.  Thanks, riffraff!  I'll be making this again."
29782,124597,2006-02-18,5,A great side dish! Loved the flavor from the marinade and grill! I only used 1/2tsp of cayenne pepper cause I was afraid it would be to hot tasteing for us. It was perfect! Thanks so much Riffraff for sharing this delicious recipe! 
171303,124597,2006-07-07,5,I made this asparagus to go alongside Middle Eastern Kebabs #94798 and we really enjoyed it.  I halved the recipe without a problem and the asparagus had a nice tang from the dressing (I used fat free Italian) and heat from the cayenne.  Thank you Riffraff for sharing this simple and delish recipe.
593927,422147,2011-06-17,3,This is good. I found the soft dried apricots a bit tough for this. The taste was OK with them. Not something I would do again.
8629,148881,2005-12-24,5,"I used the crescent rolls instead of the pie crust.  Everyone asked for seconds. The swiss cheese flavor is really good.  I'm thinking that you could probably add 1 or 2 more eggs to the egg mixture and get a little bit of a higher egg layer on it.  But the recipe turns out perfect as written, also.  Thanks for posting it."
325354,148881,2007-01-09,5,"Tastes good.  I would recommend greasing the baking dish if you use crescent rolls, I didn't the first time because the pack I used said that they were to be baked on an ungreased pan and it stuck to the bottom a little bit.  My oven is a little hot, I think, so I bake at a lower temp for a little bit longer.  Also tastes good with cheddar."
298801,148881,2007-08-14,5,"This was a great dish, we had it for dinner. After reading the reviews, I did add an extra egg for the added height. This was so good, there was none left! So much for breakfast the next morning, LOL! I did use pie crust instead of the creasent rolls. I think both would be good so next time I will try the cresent rolls. I did have to bake longer but I think this might be due to the extra egg and the oven variances."
1246373,148881,2009-04-21,0,"I love this recipe. I did find that you need to lower the temperature because 425 for 20 minutes causes the crescent rolls to burn. I baked it at 425 for the first five minutes like the directions say, but then turn it down to 350 for 30 minutes.
Comes out just right."
173579,148881,2014-01-14,5,We enjoyed this casserole very much.  I would add an extra egg next time.  Thanks for posting.
57437,231925,2008-06-10,4,"I saw Paula make this on t.v. and was coming here to post, but of course it was already here! The taste of this was excellent. I love cooking on the grill and this made a perfect side dish. I do think next time I would boil the cabbage for a little longer as when it was done, it was still a little bit hard for me in the middle, but then  I like my cabbage really cooked ."
780142,268642,2008-06-01,5,"Just made this today...it went over GREAT!!!!  Everyone loved it!  I didn't use French Bread, I made a loaf of white batter bread fresh to use for it.  Next time though, I think I'll use half of a loaf or two pans to have it bake a little more even.  With this being so easy, I'm definatly going to make this a go-to recipe for when we have company over night!"
59064,63706,2003-06-09,5,"This recipe works well but the key is getting the pieces really small. The skin can make the marmalad a bit tart but it also gives more depth of flavour. I made this using grapefruit, mandarin and lime and the marmalade has already been attacked despire only making it this morning.
It also works well on the jam setting of a bread machine although the amount is a bit less."
6357,63706,2003-08-28,5,"This is really yummy! I halved the recipe, used oranges and made it today afternoon. It still makes a real good quantity. I'm going to give away some on the upcoming festival of Ganesh Chathurthi. The tough part of this is the chopping up of really small pieces of the whole oranges. Since I don't have a food processor, I had to do it with a blender. That took me a whole hour! LOL. I was so eager to taste this even before putting it to boil, that I couldn't help myself and did taste a bit. It was DELICIOUS and a real mood lifter! Thank ""YOU"" so much for a wonderful marmalade recipe!"
117880,63706,2003-12-18,3,"I made this recipe using oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and tangerines. I followed the instructions exactly and the marmalade was done in 30 minutes. I cooked the recipe over medium heat to begin with and then had to reduce it to medium low and it kept boiling well. I had to fish out seeds, so I would recommend taking them out before processing the fruit. The taste was quite bitter or tart. Not the flavor I was hoping for. "
258947,63706,2008-09-07,5,"I made a marmarlade like this last year and gave if to friends, if has a great flavour and a really firm consistancy - everyone loved it."
486680,63706,2008-10-08,5,"So easy, so yummy.  My husband (who is a bit of a marmalade snob) was sniffing about while i was making it and was the first to try it.  He was most impressed.  I used 2 of each fruit.  Really nice.  Thank you for sharing. :)"
488441,63706,2008-10-13,5,"Wonderful! I loved it. I think I would use a little less of the orange peel next time--instead of 6 oranges with peel, I would use 6 oranges and peel 3 of them. Just my taste. Nice consistancy. Thanks!"
1058105,63706,2008-12-04,5,"This marmalade is perfect and easy. It was just what I was hoping for.  I am a marmalade snob and have a hard time finding ones I like and when I do they are outrageously priced.  I am very, very happy right now."
917568,63706,2008-12-07,5,"Holy moly, that was fast!  It really is the easiest marmalade ever.  I zested and peeled half the oranges before putting them in the blender and left the other half whole.  Absolutely perfect flavor, with just the right amount of bitterness to offset the sweet.  I also used half Splenda to make it a bit lower in calories, and it still came out excellent.  Thanks a bunch, Mirj!"
1211385,63706,2009-06-23,5,"I figured now that I've made 7 or 8 batches, I ought to finally review it  :)   This really is fail-proof, and whoa is it easy! I enjoy more whole pieces of rind in my marmalade, so I zest some of the citrus (usually 1-2 fruits worth) straight into the pot and then process the rest of the fruit through the processor. A friend had given me a ton of grapefruit so that's what I used the first time, with 2 blood oranges mixed in. WOW! Delicious taste, perfect consistency, and a beautiful color. Thank you!"
92006,63706,2009-06-24,5,"I used mandarin oranges, half peeled, half unpeeled and half splenda. It all worked very nicely. I love that you don't have to can it. Now I'll be using this to make 
Recipe #305024, which is my fave breakfast these days.Thank you for posting this great recipe!"
1330857,63706,2009-07-21,5,Excellent recipe. I'm always busy so this recipe suits me perfectly. The marmalade tastes delicious and the six jars I made are already eaten/given away. I did have to use a blender as my food processor has broken but it worked perfectly.
451700,63706,2010-03-01,5,"This is a brilliant recipe! I used 6 oranges and squeezed in a lemon too. Instead of using a food processor, I thinly sliced the oranges and then cut them in quarters, a bit tedious doing by hand but worth it! The Marmalade had the right amount of sweetness/bitterness to it. We loved it! Thank you so much, Mirj, for sharing this wonderful recipe, this one is definitely a keeper!"
1700013,63706,2010-12-31,2,"I made a half batch with 3 good size grapefruit and I used half Splenda/half sugar. Like the other reviewers who found it too bitter, mine tasted like I was chewing on rind. I would peel some of the grapefruit."
1903445,63706,2011-05-07,5,Having struggled with different marmalade recipes for years I searched on the internet for a fool proof recipe. This one came out on top and I have just made 2 different batches. One orange and lemon and the other grapefruit and orange in less than an hour. It's delicious and the best recipe around. Thank you.
2199755,63706,2012-03-03,5,Amazing..I used to spend hours making marmalade. Thanks
2695657,63706,2013-02-17,0,"Hi, I have now made two batches, one where I added the some water and the 2nd batch I didn't add any.  The 2nd batch was really really thick.  My dear husband says that although it was really thick and difficult to spread on his toast, it was very tasty.  I also added some whiskey in the first batch.<br/>I must agree with everyone that this is the easiest marmalade I have ever made and will certainly be doing it again."
1803674471,63706,2015-01-18,5,"So Easy! I used 3 Meyer Lemons and a half kg of sugar. Threw all in the Vitamix, pureed, and then boiled as instructed. Fabulous!"
2000316759,63706,2015-07-04,5,Fantastic recipe!  My marmalade usually takes ages to set and gets quite dark.  This one took the 20 mins stated and is a perfect colour.  Thank you so much - will be making it again.
2000688429,63706,2015-11-17,0,"Love it!!!  I like the bite of the rind, and large pieces of it, so I did cook longer than 20 minutes.  I checked it every 5 minutes after that until the rinds were translucent and the gel would be thick enough."
129772,63706,2017-01-13,0,Has anyone processed this jam in jars with sealed lids? Would you have to use paraffin? I'd like to make it for Christmas gifts which is nearly a year away.
2001645061,63706,2017-07-27,4,"The rind was too chewy for my liking but taste wise very good as its not too sweet, can you make it without the peel?"
2002195093,63706,2018-06-23,5,Just made this using 4 grapefruit 1 lemon and 1 orange then with 4 oranges 1 grapefruit and 1 lemon I removed all pips before I placed the fruit in the food processor both batches turned out fantastic I cooked longer than the recipe said as we prefer the rind to be soft. I will always this recipe now as so easy and absolutely delicious ?? 10 out of 10
2002262144,63706,2018-08-31,5,I made this recipe and cooked in the microwave for 25 minutes and it turned out perfectly I used home grown lemons and mandarins (from next door neighbour) next time I am adding Grapefruit as well. They grow the fruit and I jam them (good deal). What I did with the pips of the fruit I squeezed them over a sieve into the bowl and then just quartered the fruit. So no pips in jam. Happy jamming
66987,116190,2005-11-29,0,"Great difference from your usual dessert!  I thought the coconut milk was a little too thick and added some water to give it a smoother lighter texture.  I put my sesame seeds in the toaster oven and they definitely didn't need 3 minutes, had to keep my eye or they were going to burn.  I really liked it a lot with the exception that the bananas were a little too firm, but then again I did refrigerate the bowls for a couple of hours which is why I'm not putting a rating down yet.  Next time I want to try serving it hot like Amanda did and see if the bananas are softer!"
195175,114011,2005-07-12,3,"To me this was OK, but DH asked me not to make it again. He didn't like the bacon...personal taste?  "
28177,114011,2006-12-29,4,"I get teased for adding bacon to just about everything, so that's always safe in my house.  I used fresh beans & forgot to steam them first.  lol
We'll make again with canned or pre-cooked beans next time."
227652,114011,2007-07-29,4,"I made these for my husband tonight-they came out great! I used about half the olive oil amount & added some oregano. I also used turkey bacon to lighten it up. Easy, fast & delicious! Thank u for sharing."
211184,114011,2009-09-28,4,We liked these and I loved that I could prep them in advance and just pop into the oven when I was ready. I thought the garlic was right on and the bacon and parm were nice additions for a little change. Made for PAC FAll 2009
226145,362466,2009-03-23,5,"Wow!  This is fantastic!  I never thought of putting lemon and nutmeg on asparagus, but this is a new favorite!  Will make again soon!"
648604,362466,2009-06-22,5,"So simple, yet so delicious! Thanks!"
128803,25885,2004-09-12,5,This was a wonderfully moist banana bread.  Will use this recipe again and again!
165169,25885,2008-06-29,0,"How can you go wrong with this reicpe?  Very simple, yet so so good!!!"
54678,182042,2007-02-20,4,I had some leftover brown rice pilaf so I used that and mixed with the cabbage/beef mixture plus the chicken broth. Forgot the butter but everyone loved it anyways.
41578,182042,2008-01-27,5,"This is a great comforting casserole.  It reminded me of Bierocks which we love but a lot easier than making the dumplings. This is a winner, Rose of Sharon, can't wait to make it again."
2475814,182042,2014-04-16,5,"Easy and very good! However, the recipe made allot more than can fit in one casserole dish, I had to use two casserole dishes. I used short grain Japanese rice."
153188,109818,2007-12-01,3,"These were good.  Definitely a different twist on the same old carrot dish.  I liked the bacon in it, but I like bacon in anything!  Thanks for a change of pace."
6258,43412,2002-11-12,4,"These little appetizers are really good.  I made them according to directions, with no changes.  I will be making them again to freeze for the holidays.  They were easy to make and very tasty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe."
47892,129305,2011-10-09,0,I liked that taste and texture of this bread but the dough was <br/>extremely sticky to work with. Tasted great the next day grilled<br/>and served with soup however. I cut the recipe down to two loaves<br/>and used a KitchenAid stand up mixer to prep the dough.  Reviewed for<br/>Veg Tag/October.
2020853,129305,2011-11-09,0,well i followed directions and the bread was very doughie.
462999,155619,2007-03-09,5,"A little time consuming at the stovetop, but it hasn't stopped me from making it again and again.  Very light and not too sweet, just as said.  A favorite for all who sample!"
539587,155619,2007-07-17,4,I added a little bit of almond extract to it...yummy :)
526395,155619,2013-12-20,5,"Really really excellent, not-too-sweet frosting!  I agree that it is a little bit time consuming as it takes me a while to slowly thicken the milk and flour but it&#039;s worth it in the end.... and this frosting pipes well too!  Everyone I&#039;ve ever made it for loves it :)"
21752,125928,2005-06-16,5,"Quick is right, and incredibly easy!  I used the idea of putting the batter in a squeeze bottle and we ate our names for breakfast!  I made up a second batch and used it to make waffles in my waffle iron.  We topped our pancakes and waffles with golden syrup (for me) and with chocolate spread (my youngest Dornette)."
537188,125928,2007-12-01,5,This recipe made me realise that things that are the simplest often taste the best : they were really quick to make and tasted great! Thanks!
126435,125928,2008-01-04,5,"These taste JUST like the pancakes my Alabama Grandmother made for me when I was a little girl. MAN this takes me back home again!!!!! My uncle also used to make our names or initials out of the pancake batter, and this was the perfect recipe to do that for my boys as well. Thank you for taking me back to my childhood, and giving me a chance to do the same for my sons."
537937,125928,2008-04-03,5,"Thanks bama for a quick supper for me to make tonight after working 10 hours.  We often have breakfast for supper and paired with some sausage, DH and DS's were good to go.  I used 3/4 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup skim milk.  Also, I added a few blueberries to the batter.  I love the added sugar, as it was just the right amount of sweetness.  Thanks for posting a good one!!!
Made for Spring PAC '08~"
101376,125928,2008-07-13,5,"Oh MY! These are wonderful! Bye Bye mixes , hello homemade! LOL

Easy mix up and if I only had a griddle they'd be quick for me to cook too! LOL

I love the flavor of these! The bit of sweet with the sugar ... Mmmm .. these will DEFINITELY be made again!!

Thanks so much for posting!"
269521,366307,2009-05-02,5,Very tasty and alot easier than twice baked potatoes.   Thanks for sharing.
186855,366307,2010-04-08,5,"What's not to like?  These are the best darn 'Diet' potatoes I've ever had.  Who knew full fat cheddar, bacon and sour cream were diet food? :)  Acadia, it's clear I've been reading the wrong books. ;)  Honoured to make this as a ""Thank You"" for voting for Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia in the 2010 Kraft Hockeyville Competition."
542159,483632,2012-07-22,5,"Wow Hokies you were right this does make a fantastic open faced sandwich! I halved some ciabatta rolls brushed with olive oil and popped under the broiled along with the tomatoes. The ricotta really adds nice texture and body to the topping on these wonderfully flavored topping, yes I know a whole tablespoon of dried oregano sounds like a lot but it is the perfect amount."
22015,19078,2002-09-26,5,"Loved this.  I even had 2 leftover and reheated them the next day.  It was still great.  Used some of the hot sauce that I was sent in the food swap and added a little bit more than was called for, still great.  Thanks for posting it.  I never knew that I liked cooked whole tomatos before I tried this.  "
35965,19078,2002-10-10,5,"I've seen a couple mentions of people trying this recipe and they just raved and then I really wanted to try it.  I thought our tomatoes were done for the season and that I'd have to buy tomatoes to make it...in fact, I asked Lorac about a method she uses to improve store bought tomatoes (over in the message and thank you board) thinking I would have to try this recipe with them.  Not so...DH and I went for a walk in the yard a couple days ago and found we have a few really nice sized tomatoes that frost hasn't gotten yet and they were ripe!  since they were larger than medium size, I used 3 and kept the rest of the recipe measurements the same.  I didn't have fresh spinach, but found in a substitutions resource that beet greens can be substituted, so I headed back out to the garden and collected some of them.  This was absolutely delicious.  I shortened the baking time by about 5 minutes and the tomatoes were warmed and just slightly softened, but not cooked through.  This tasted like we were eating a BLT without the bread...yummy.  DH and I each had one and I packed the other in a lunch tray to send over to my MIL (She's 73, and a widow, so anything that I feel will reheat well, I use to make TV dinners for her to throw in the microwave)."
29196,19078,2002-10-30,5,"I made this at work today, but I made it slightly differently-same ingredients, just a different presentation. Also multiplied the recipe by nearly 3.
I cored the tomatoes, and cut them in half (around the equator), I lay 16 halves in my baking tray, spread over half the filling mix, some cheese, then repeated all that. I then cooked them in the oven til the cheese was golden brown. Excellent."
80353,19078,2003-10-14,5,"Excellent recipe using up the last of our vine-ripened tomatoes.  I must confess to also adding 2 minced garlic cloves, but the combination of flavours was really wonderful!"
157096,19078,2004-09-01,5,"This was absolutely wonderful!!  I didn't have any bacon, but I wilted the spinach in bacon grease (I'm Southern, I always have bacon grease in the frige) and you couldn't tell that there wasn't bacon in it.  Next time I will shorten the bake time so the tomato isn't so soft, but otherwise, this was a great dish.  "
29014,19078,2005-03-13,5,"This was indeed - heaven!  Since tomatoes are out of season here right now, I used the ripened-on-the-vine variety, and this was just awesome.  I cannot even imagine how good this will be when garden tomatoes are ready to go!  I made the recipe exactly as posted and ended up with ten small to medium stuffed tomatoes.  Bonus!:  Because there's just two of us, I had leftovers, so I chopped them up, stuffing and all, and added to homemade tomato soup - wow, TDF!!  Thanks, Lorac, for a real keeper!"
54716,65684,2003-08-06,5,"Yup.  This is a cosmic experience!  Simple to make, hard to stop eating! Many request to re-make this one over and over."
116401,65684,2004-02-17,5,"Oh wow!do try this! These potatoes are so goood....filled a deep dish 13x19 pan nicely and I did bake them for the one and a half hours. Much better If cooked for the extra half hour---very addictive, comfort food without big effort. I used milk I can only imagine what they are like with half and half, etc. For your sweet try Karen's CCC brownies you wont be sorry!!Thnks, Whisper!"
252816,65684,2005-12-18,5,"My family loved these potatoes. I personally did not. I found them way to rich for me. On the other hand my husband,daughter and son in law thought they were the best thing since sliced bread. So, I gave it a 5, they out numbered me...."
193402,65684,2006-01-05,4,My children don't like pork at all but they love this recipe. My husband would eat it 7 nights a week! It's very easy to make. Great on rolls as a leftover. 
199848,65684,2006-04-08,5,"Bubbly, cheesey, baked shredded hashbrown potatoes....what's not to love?  I baked mine for 75 minutes and that was plenty.  I used butter and sauteed my onions in the butter and made my sauce as directed from there. I did use the half and half. Very easy to make and soooo delicious.  Thanx for posting; I'll make this often."
214973,65684,2006-12-10,5,"Easy to make and easy to eat.  Delicious.  I made a half recipe and used 2% milk, low fat cottage cheese and reduced the margarine by half.  Also, I added capers, since I was in the mood for them.  I baked it for one hour and it was perfect.  Prep time was only 10 minutes."
302173,65684,2007-10-04,5,Absolutly the best hashbrown casserole every. I cut my butter down to 4 tbls. My family request this side dish often.
278274,65684,2008-12-21,4,"This is fabulous comfort food that I ate for breakfast and again with rotisserie chicken and salad for dinner. It's just WAY too much butter. Next time I will cut the butter in half, too. I added salt and pepper in the sauce, spinkled 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar on top, and covered with aluminum foil for the first hour.  9 year old picky eater cleaned his plate!!"
572672,65684,2009-01-27,5,I thought I had already reviewed this one....but it seems I havent!  I love this.  I have probably made it 5 or 6 times in the last couple of months because it is so easy and so yummy.  I use milk instead of half and half and I always use velveeta cheese.  Everyone at my house loves it!  No one realizes there is cottage cheese in it.....shhhhhh!
1208760,65684,2012-01-20,5,"Thank goodness I halved this recipe!!!  I couldn't stop eating it!!  Sooooo good!  I didn't really read the recipe before I started to make it - and so it did not sit for an hour - and since the hash browns were frozen and dinner needed to get on the table - I cranked the oven up:  385 for the first 30 minutes (covered), then uncovered at 425 for an additional 30 minutes!  Worked perfectly!  And, it turned out I didn't have enough cheddar cheese - so I added about 2 ounces of smoked mozzarella to the sauce - great addition!!!  In short, this recipe is yummy, a family pleaser AND fool-proof!!!"
629291,65684,2012-08-26,3,"This was really good!  I have made other cheese potato casseroles in the past and I was afraid this wouldn't be as good but it was!  The only change I would make would be maybe use 1/2 -3/4 of a small onion. I was afraid that the onion would not cook but it did so there really is no need to cook it first ( which is what I thought about doing at first).  I used half and half, low fat cottage cheese, Velveeta and all of the margarine called for, it turned out to be nice and creamy and cheesy and I didn't find it overly greasy. The recipe didn't say but I thawed my potatoes before I made this and it did sit in the fridge overnight.  I will be saving this one, thanks!"
184097,19078,2005-06-16,5,This is a wonderful recipe.  I am really learning to love lorac; you can count on her for great food.  I think this is a great side dish that is really going to spice up my recipe collection.  I had been looking for the perfect baked tomato recipe and this is it!
108915,19078,2005-07-25,5,"Awesome!  I used proscuitto instead of bacon, but I still used some bacon grease to sautee the onion.  Also, I sliced large tomato ""steaks"" instead of removing the centers.  Of course, this made everything really juicy, but it was so good on top of crusty bread!  There is really no substitute for fresh, farmers' market tomatoes!"
50712,19078,2005-09-14,1,"Sorry, But I don't get what everyone raved about. No one in my family like it."
290010,19078,2006-09-09,5,"I would not call this dish heaven.  I reserve that word for chocolate or cheesecake dishes, only.  However, this is a very good dish.  I used 6 slices of bacon and 3-4 dashes of hot sauce.  I will definately make this again. "
51717,19078,2007-12-28,5,"This is a keeper. Followed the recipe exactly, except I did not top with grated cheese. This was a side to our Christmas dinner roast that also included Ultimate Scalloped Potates #42532, so there was quite enough cheese in the mix already. Our tomatoes were rather large, so I made the full recipe for the filling and had some left over. Just added that as extra topping for the last tomato to go with a ham steak a few days later."
2136916,19078,2012-02-26,5,Great! I added 1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs and 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese. These are wonderful.
293410,247058,2008-11-25,5,"Can't give any less than 5 stars- these are so cool! The breading and the texture of the defrosted tofu were spot-on! Great for dunking in ketchup, sweet and sour, or my favorite honey sub, agave nectar :-) The only thing I'd like to change is trying different marinades. My brother found the poultry seasoning tasted ""soapy"" (LOL) and I feel like the tofu could have been more flavorful (for one thing, my poultry seasoning didn't have any salt in it)... anyway, lots of interesting variations in the future for this recipe in our house! Thanks so much for this creative post!"
2370727,247058,2013-02-26,5,I am in charge of catering for a sorority and this recipe is a hit for our vegetarian members.  Our cook omited the yogurt and soaked the tofu in soy sauce for a vegan version which is fantastic.
1056692,247058,2013-08-05,4,"I enjoyed this, but you have to at least like tofu&#039;s texture for this one.  Even with freezing and thawing and pressing, this still had that tell-tale sponginess.  I cheated after baking, as I couldn&#039;t get the coating to crisp up, and so I did finish these by frying in a skillet.  Next time I&#039;m splurging on carbs, I&#039;ll keep the marinade, but use panko rather than the cornmeal/starch mixture to see if it crisps up better in the oven.  I only had Greek yogurt, so I added some buttermilk to thin this out a bit.  Other than that (and the frying) I followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing."
315565,261850,2011-01-11,5,"These were delicious and really easy to make. They are versatile and I left out the coconut, reduced the sugar and added more nuts. They are a healthy-ish and were devoured with gusto !!"
192144,287259,2008-02-23,5,This is one of my favorite snacks before bedtime (only 1 banana-more sugar!)       most people look at me kind of weird when I say that I grew up eating this!  Thanx for posting and letting me know that I'm not the strange one-everyone else is!
788106,287259,2008-03-29,5,I grew up doing the same thing with strawberries or blueberries- whatever was in season.  A little sugar and milk is great with all kinds of fruit!  Try it on mixed fruit!  Yumm!
510396,287259,2008-03-30,5,This is an awesome recipe. I also grew up eating this. Except I omit the sugar as bananas are sweet enough for me. Thanks for posting. Hope others will try as this is tasty and a healthy breakfast choice.
145626,287259,2008-04-07,5,I too grew up eating this.  I thought it was a healthy snack and I'm glad to see others say the same.  My mother always thought it was fattening.
64583,287259,2008-04-07,5,This is what my mom served me for a special treat or bedtime snack when I was a kid.  It's perfectly delicious and comforting!  Thanks for posting!
58407,287259,2008-10-14,5,My childhood friend and I always ate this at her house in the morning or as a snack! I thought we were the only ones to eat this and here is  on 'Zaar! Great memory for me from the early 60's! Thanks for posting it!
593927,287259,2012-05-22,5,With brown sugar.
383346,287259,2012-10-14,5,I made this for my son and he liked it a lot.  Thanks Cindi :)  Made for PAC Fall 2012
279294,216326,2010-01-26,5,"So Simple, Fast & Healthy!!!"
67728,495987,2014-04-23,5,"Definitely a keeper! I was initially skeptical that the egg mixture would be enough to properly bind all the veggies in it, but it baked up perfectly. I used reduced fat cheese because that&#039;s what I accidentally picked up at the store, but next time I will probably use full-fat cheese for better texture (reduced fat cheese wasn&#039;t too bad, but texture was a bit rubbery -- my fault, not the recipe&#039;s). I only got 4 servings out of this, not 9 -- maybe it would serve 9 as small pieces on a breakfast buffet with other items. I actually enjoyed this warm as breakfast, and then another piece at room temp for dinner. Very good both ways. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1179225,495987,2014-05-02,4,"Delicious! I added some chopped green onion and a tiny bit of cayenne to the egg mixture. For some reason I needed to baked this for an additional 15 mins and it still didn&#039;t set up completely firm, but it tasted great. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
76950,72367,2003-10-24,5,"A special treat Tart,was easy to make. the taste was just like the one I had in Germany,which was delicious.
 I will make this again with pears for a differnt twist."
102937,72367,2004-04-16,5,"Where have you been all my life?  A+ in simplicity, presentation, early preparation and taste!  I have made quite a few different types of cakes, tarts, etc. in my life, this is one of the best!  All my friends thought I bought it at a bakery...until they saw the bottom of the springform pan on the plate!  I ate 2 slices by myself, even though I'm on a low-carb diet, but this is worth every pound that I gain!  Thanks LorenLou!"
239182,72367,2006-04-14,5,"Very tasty.  I split the recipe and made tartlets and reduced the cooking time a bit, and they turned out wonderful."
359856,72367,2007-01-20,5,one of the best cheese tarts EVER. thank you for posting it ^^
607209,72367,2007-12-27,5,"Supremely easy and delicious. I used shortcrust pastry from the freezer, and followed the recipe for the rest. Looked great too."
60504,72367,2008-01-18,4,I tried this today and i thought it was pretty easy to whip up. I used a mandolin to slice the apples very thinly and although my tart didnt look half as good as Mark's pic but it smelled heavenly while baking. This tastes somewhat like apple cheese cake.
1319234,72367,2009-08-04,5,Excellent recipe. I took a short cut and some liberties. for my short cut I used a store bought rolled up pie crust and a tart pan. I like the way the fluted edges look. I have a peeler/corer/slicer that took care of the apples quick. (best investment ever when you live in an apple growing state) My liberties were instead of vanilla extract and almonds sprinkled on top I used 1/2 tsp of almond extract and an apricot glaze to make it shiny. Thanks Lorenlou it was tasty!
779452,72367,2009-09-07,5,"We enjoyed this with the in-laws!  Quick and easy, although I did cheat with the crust.  I used partially overlapping granny smith apple slices that I cut with the apple tool mentioned by raisingcain (I love mine too!). I used ready-made shortbread crust from the bakery aisle.  Delicious!"
597538,72367,2009-10-15,5,I made this for company and everyone loved it!  Simple to throw together and the results couldn't be better!
963934,72367,2009-10-17,5,"This was a huge hit with DH & DS.  The morning after, I found one slim wedge left in the kitchen.  The low-fat cream cheese works just fine, as did using a 10"" springform pan & 3 large cooking apples.  Thanks LorenLou for a ""tart with a twist""."
1376400,72367,2010-01-24,5,"Turned out so well despite few modifications. For the crust, I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/16 tsp salt instead of 1/3 cup sugar. Because I ran out of butter, I also substituted with 1/4 cup butter+ 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening. I followed the recipe exactly for the cream cheese mixture. I added only 2 tbsp sugar to the sliced apples (about 4 medium Granny Smith apples) instead of 1/3 cup. I omitted the sliced almonds but will not do so next time because it seems the tart could taste even more amazing with them. The tart came out pretty and not to sweet. However it tasted a little eggy so next time I might try to use only 1 egg and a bit of cream instead of 2 eggs."
222970,72367,2010-03-06,5,"Practically perfect. I made it in a 12 inch tart pan, so I changed the recipe to 12 servings (1-1/2 the original recipe) and it worked just right. Delicious. I forgot the almonds, but want to try them next time. It sure makes a beautiful tart!"
529571,72367,2010-11-14,5,Easy to make and delicious!
789516,72367,2011-02-27,5,"What a delicious, beautiful looking tart!!  It was worth the extra effort to nicely arrange the apple slices in the dish.  I especially loved the shortbread crust!!"
494589,72367,2011-03-26,5,I used Macintosh apples and followed the recipe... It came out beautifull and delicious.  I served homemade whipped cream on top and sprinkled with chopped almonds...  Delicious to say the least!
1750924,72367,2011-10-23,5,This tart is fantastic.  I made it in my food processor which shortened prep time.  I'll be serving it at my next dinner party.  No whipped cream needed!  Thank you for the recipe.
2742639,72367,2013-07-22,5,"OMG, this is one of the best recipes I&#039;ve made. It has a wonderful texture. I have begun to make it with whole wheat flour which give it a little bit of a wheat taste. Thanks for posting this great tart."
609918,72367,2013-10-16,0,I found this recipe about 20 yrs ago and people always rave over it. Just a wonderful blend of flavors and textures. I love that it can be made ahead but we prefer to serve it at room temperature. I&#039;ve been asked to share the recipe dozens of times.
529278,72367,2014-10-29,4,"We enjoyed this as a change of pace in our apple desserts.  I used honey crisp apples as that is what I had on hand.  They did not soften up so I won&#039;t cook with them again, but the taste was good. This came together quickly.  I liked it better on day two, when the juices had had time to soak into the crust.  It wasn&#039;t soggy at all but rather like a moist sugar cookie.  It did not last past day two :)"
555710,72367,2014-12-15,5,"Adjusted the recipe for my 11&quot; tart pan without a problem. The cheesecake filling is absolutely delicious -- sweet and creamy without being too heavy. I omitted the almonds and didn&#039;t particularly miss them. All in all, this is a great recipe that is sure to impress!"
1179225,72367,2015-01-01,4,"This was a really simple, and quick to assemble recipe. I think I might have liked to have par-baked the crust, my crust became a little soggy. Loved that this tart wasn&#039;t overly sweet. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
400708,72367,2018-09-14,5,"This is so good, everyone loved it. The review is for the tart itself (not the pastry) it was the hit of our dinner and so perfect for this fall weather and all our apples from our orchard. Served it topped with homemade salted caramel ice cream and whipped cream. A stellar desert that made me look so talented. I'll be using it often"
307052,408938,2011-10-10,5,Made this for both sets of parents while they were visiting for the holidays and everyone RAVED! My MIL used to own a restaurant so I always try to impress her with recipes when she visits... this one did the trick!!
169430,269086,2008-02-16,4,"This bread has a wonderful flavor. I needed to trim the fat and sugar for my use and I did so by useing Splenda for the sugar, 1/4 cup of walnut oil and1/4 cup of applesauce for the butter, fat free cheese, skim milk and 1/2 a cup of egg whites for the whole eggs. The volume of batter I had didn't look like enough for a 9x5 pah and I used an 8x4 and that turned out well. Thank you for a lovely treat Mary. Made for Photo Tag"
512309,269086,2008-03-03,4,"This was very good, with subtle apple and walnut-ty flavors.  The cheddar flavor blends in so much that it's not all that distinguishable to my palate, but that could just be my palate!  :D  I think next time I make this, and there will definitely be a next time, I will coarsely dice my cheddar instead of shredding it, so that the large chunks can stay intact and contribute more flavor to the bite of the bread.  My DD loved it, though, and wanted to give it 10 stars.  :-)
Thanks, Loof!"
573325,269086,2010-09-19,5,"This is an awesome recipe, loof!<br/>My sis and me loved it and ate the whole loaf all by ourselves. lol<br/>The cheese goes great with the apples and cinnamon and adds just that special something. My bread turned out way moister than in the pics even though I only used 1/4 cup oil, it was more a cake than a bread. Very yummy!<br/>Since we like our cakes/breads on the less sweet side, I only used 1/4 cup sugar and that was perfect for us. Next time I might follow Annacia's lead and use applesauce in place of the oil and then reduce the sugar a tad more as well.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this tasty treat with us, loof!<br/>Made and reviewed for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders Tag Game September 2010."
424680,269086,2011-05-17,5,"Almost followed your recipe right on down, but was very generous with the measuring of the cheese, & we had ourselves a really outstanding treat, for sure! I slathered my first slice with some homemade apple butter, while my other half used a bit of cream cheese! However you do it, the bread itself is very, very satisfying & certainly the recipe is a keeper! [Made & reviewed in 1-2-3 Hits tag]"
65502,269086,2011-09-27,5,"This bread is delicious! I was concerned because the ""batter"" was so thick but it turned out perfectly. This was most enjoyed warm from the oven - no butter required! I would at least double the cheese next time because it's the one thing that I didn't really taste. Also, I used skim milk, low fat cheese and Recipe #5274 for the flour. Made for Almost 5 tag game. Thanks loof! :)"
542159,269086,2011-11-20,5,A rich fall flavored bread that has delighted all who tasted it. As a rule I do not read the reviews before making but this time did and am glad I did as it did lead to me increasing the cheese a bit using 3/4  of  cup. Will make this flavorful well balanced bread exactly the same way again. Thanks for the post.
1169750,269086,2013-09-18,5,"Found this recipe many years ago in a magazine and hadn&#039;t made it since.  This time, I used tart apples and sharp cheddar cheese. Really good!"
193014,193417,2006-12-16,5,"This recipe is great.  It is so fast and easy, and the results are addicting.  I get amused when reviews tell of the changes a person made in a recipe, although I do it all the time. I didn't have slivered almonds so I attempted chopped almonds.  The results were not positive.  Tasted great, but didn't turn out like it should have.  I tried it with cashew halves, and that was great.  I tried it with small peanut halves, and that worked great, too."
106624,193417,2009-01-21,5,"This is the same as mine which I have been making for over twenty more years. The only thing that I do is if using nuts I toast then place them onto my buttered pan and then pour the cooked butter/sugar mixture on top of them. I also now do not butter my jelly roll pan but put a sill pat on it ,pour it directly  on top of the nuts, cools and comes off oh so easy.  I use the sillpat for sponge toffee too, or peanut brittle.   Great recipe."
647466,193417,2009-09-16,4,This was good and easy to make.
30674,52697,2003-04-06,5,"Awesome, simply awesome!  Thank you for sharing this with us - it is very authentic and very tasty and easy to make!"
60989,52697,2003-10-15,5,"OH MY GOODNESS! We had these for dinner tonight (after stupid me forgot to turn on the crockpot). DS decided he wanted apple pancakes and chose this. To die for! Tastes just like the ones we have gotten for breakfast at a local restaurant. DS had TWO of these wonderfully tasty and HUGE pancakes! Thanks Bethany!!! 
BTW, I am making these again when my mom comes to visit. MY MOM! If that doesn't tell you these are incredible, nothing will! "
220172,52697,2005-06-02,5,"I made this to get extra credit in German Class, and everyone in the class loved it! my whole family loves it too!"
303700,52697,2006-10-01,2,"I was a little disappointed in the texture of the pancakes,maybe I was expecting them to be like my regular batter....but with no baking powder to make them rise,they seemed too eggy as well.I did love the apple mixture which I would use with my regular pancake batter.I will try them again with less eggs and see how they turn out."
290614,52697,2007-02-28,5,These pancakes were absolutly delicious! I served them with warmed real maple syrup and some thick slab cut bacon. We easily could have licked our plates clean. Thank you for sharing this recipe!
755648,52697,2008-02-07,5,Really Good!
962257,52697,2008-12-08,5,"Delicious! I have omitted the sugar for the apple filling (b/c the MacIntosh apples are quite sweet already), and using only about 1Tbsp butter to sautee apples, and then brush about 1/2 tsp on pan for each pancake made.  I serve them with thick slices of bacon, and maple syrup... MmmMmmm, thanks for sharing!"
2045025,52697,2011-10-26,5,"Fantastic!  For a person who can barely make normal pancakes, I found this recipe really fun and easy to follow.  Adding temperatures and timing may have helped, but I ended up figuring it out quickly on my stove.  I ate it without any maple syrup; I found that the apples, cinnamon, and sugar were satisfying enough.  The taste reminded me of waffles I used to make.  Pretty darn good!"
1588420,52697,2017-06-18,1,I tried this recipe for my husband on Father's Day. He is German and we have had apple pancakes at his mom's many times. This is nothing like what she makes. It has way too many eggs and seemed more like an omelette than a pancake. Gross.
324390,185672,2006-09-16,5,"This was sooo good. I added just a touch of splenda as the recipe suggested and served it with mixed greens, sliced peaches, and candied walnuts. What a delicious lunch!"
126104,185672,2006-10-23,4,"This was very nice.  I put some fried chicken over some bagged salad, and just this dressing.  When peaches are in season again, I will definitely make this again."
413880,185672,2009-07-12,4,"Since we have been trying to eat more salads, I am always looking for a different way to eat those greens (spring mix from the garden). When the peaches came in I thought I would like to try this dressing and then put peaches and candied walnuts or almonds  in the salad.  I really thought something with honey, vinegar, and olive oil would be great.  I was a little leery of the basil, but since I have it in the garden I thought I would give it a chance.  I did misread the honey amount and put in 1 T instead, but we liked it this way and I will probably put that amount in from now on.  My husband said at first he wasn't sure about it, but by the 3rd bite he liked it. If you are afraid of the basil- just leave it out.  Thanks for a new way to use those peaches and eat those greens!"
310156,338504,2008-12-01,4,"This was really good!  Next time I will 1/2 the sugar, but I will make this again"
473618,401837,2012-12-28,5,"This is the best, best, best breakfast casserole around!  I love this casserole.    I do make one change though.  I have the need for less sodium in my diet so I either use plain croutons or low sodium sausage.  Oh and by the way, did I mention how wonderful this is???  :)"
149043,90072,2004-10-03,5,"Simple and delicious!  I was excited to see ""you may not need all the sauce"" because that gave me leeway to fix two pounds of asparagus.  YUM.  A couple leftovers that I can't wait to eat.  Thanks for posting this recipe and congratulations on winning the football pool. "
88099,90072,2004-11-14,5,"Sue, this was absolutely wonderful.  I didn't make it in the microwave, instead I made the sauce on the stove and steamed the asparagus and it turned out great.  I didn't change any of the recipe except the microwave cooking method. I loved the sauce.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe."
48107,90072,2005-10-15,5,"I first made this in June, and gave it a rave review because it was excellent.  It still is excellent, but I wanted to edit to provide the following information:  If you use already-shredded cheese in a package, it's fine (although I doubled the cheese, we don't like runnier sauces).  But if you grate your own cheese from a block, as I did this time around, you need to at least double the amount of flour.  I used an entire block of cheese because it kept not thickening, and ended up with almost four cups before I thought to add more flour.  Still a great recipe, but it's better with pre-shredded cheese in a package."
291560,90072,2006-04-21,3,"This was not bad, but certainly not worth a high review. I'm not sure if asparagus goes well with cheddar cheese at all. It just didn't taste right to me. However, this is a nice simple sauce to trow together for some broccoli or cauliflower :)"
236760,90072,2006-04-28,5,I have a bamboo steamer that I cooked the asparagus in.  The cheese sauce was delightful and my fresh asparagus from the garden loves you and your recipe.  Thanks!
537179,90072,2008-02-16,5,This was so easy to make. Very tasty. And I loved the fact that there was extra cheese sauce. We drizzled it over our baked potatoes. I will be making this again. Thanks for such an easy and wonderful recipe.
157167,90072,2009-03-23,5,"I didn't make the sauce, just the asparagus (though the sauce does sound good!)  I used a pyrex loaf pan, and found the asparagus was crisp tender in 4.5 minutes.  :-)  TFS!"
288985,90072,2011-10-01,4,"A flavorful sauce (I used cheedar-jack cheese), but I didn't like the slightly grainy texture from the roux. I think I would rather use cornstarch stirred into cool milk, and just make it on the stovetop next time and get that silkier texture. I did not have any problems with thickening like another reviewer commented on. When I stirred in the hot milk, it thickened beautifully and immediately. <br/>I added a touch of garlic powder and freshly cracked pepper. Was very tasty!"
67728,477587,2012-11-14,5,"I had one more pound of ground lamb to use up after making your meat pies, so I used it in this. I really like the seasoning in this (I used the allspice and pepper option). I think this is a better option for a dinner than it is for a breakfast, but it's delicious no matter when you choose to serve it. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Fall 2012"
985088,99028,2008-10-11,5,"Great recipe. Make sure the first side is well cooked before you flip, otherwise it becomes a real mess! I got it right by the last one. Very close to my breakfast memories of Bali."
284897,99028,2013-03-04,4,"It took me until the last pancake to get it right, but then again I always have trouble cooking pancakes :-)<br/>I think my banana's may have been just a little to ripe because they broke up a bit, and I did have a lot of trouble turning them. Again probably my fault!<br/>Apart from the pancakes being a little odd looking, we quite enjoyed these with ice cream.<br/>Thanks Jan."
2618201,317389,2013-01-06,4,"We loved this for taste, ease and quickness. These are ingredients that I always have and never thought to put together. The only addition was some chopped fresh tomato, seeded. As per the suggestion, I added Mex-mix cheese on top. Great go-to Sunday night supper."
168764,110803,2005-02-24,4,"I royally screwed this recipe up but it still turned out great.  By the time I had a 1/2 TBS of liquid left and I removed it from the heat, it turned into a sticky ball of mess. I added the butter and mixed with the balsamic/onion anyway, then discarded the balsamic/onion clump and mixed in the green beans.  They tasted really good.  I'm new to cooking so I guess maybe next time, I will remove it from the heat earlier.  Thanks!"
303700,226115,2008-08-21,5,"Made for Photo Tag.
Made EXACTLY as directed and its SUPER!!!
I am a HUGE stuffing lover and this did not disappoint.I was so surprised at how tasty this stuffing is with no extra herbs added in.Anyone who likes a Roast Stuffed Bird ;) should give this a whirl.
(No gizzards were harmed in the preparation of this recipe. LOL)"
197023,226115,2008-11-05,5,"I halved the recipe to stuff a chicken; well, when I say halved, my proportions were still pretty generous.  For example I still used one medium-sized onion.  I held off adding any herbs - r-e-a-l-l-y difficult - but I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I have no idea where I'd be able to get hold of the optional turkey gizzard (not that I particularly wanted to!) so I omitted that.  A seriously delicious stuffing.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.  made for PRMR."
465829,226115,2008-11-24,5,"A very good stuffing indeed. I always used the gizzards without knowing what I was doing anyways. I so wanted to, but held myself back from adding thyme and rosemary. I did however, add it to the turkey after stuffing it ;) I normally do not like to stuff a bird because of my fears of contamination, but I am alive today to make the report, so I think it was fine. I loved adding the bacon to it, it added such a great flavor to the whole thing and a richness to the gravy as the drippings made their way to the pan. I will make this again, but I can't promise to hold myself back again from throwing some garlic and pepper in there! Made and Enjoyed for Please Review My Recipe tag - Thanks! :)"
424680,226115,2009-06-13,5,"Well, I hadn't intended to stuff anything with this, but after reading the into MORE CAREFULLY, I decided to have a go at stuffing a rolled pork roast, & it really worked out well! I cut the recipe in half (Did leave out the gizzard since the pig didn't have one to offer up!), then unrolled the roast, stuffed the bugger well & tied it back up! VERY, VERY TASTY & well worth-doing this way! Thanks for a very nice recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Please Review My Recipe]"
628076,226115,2009-12-04,5,Stuffing is so much better in the bird then baked on the side and this recipe is evidence of that for sure. The bacon added a smoky flavor to the stuffing that was a nice twist. Sorry no gizzards for us as I save these to help flavor the gravy!
1584953,226115,2010-11-16,4,"I've been making this stuffing for over 30 years,however I always add poultry seasoning to the mixture. Can't imagine it without it. FYI, you can easily use pre-packaged dry bread croutons, just add more liquid to the mix. It really is delicious, and the bacon adds a nice flavor."
35140,25885,2002-05-27,5,"I made these in muffins tins.  This is, hands down, the most incredible banana bread/muffin my family has ever eaten.  They're just terrific and will be a regular in my house."
45934,25885,2002-07-25,5,"Yummy! Got rave reviews from my kids, which is really saying something! :)"
9486,25885,2002-07-28,5,Great! Family loves it Have made it twice.
38681,25885,2002-08-05,5,"Hard to say if this is banana bread or banana pudding, it is so moist and creamy hot out of the oven.    I thought I had ruined it since 60-65 minutes is a bit long and mine had turned dark brown after about 45 minutes, but with all that banana in it it was still moist inside while the outside is caramalized.  I did a few changes, I used half whole wheat flour/half white flour, a teaspoon of vanilla, plus a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Definitely good enough to let bananas get over ripe on purpose!"
50997,25885,2002-08-15,4,"I found this recipe quite good and much prefer using the brown sugar than the white called for in most recipes. 
My husband took it in his brief case on the plane (since that is probably all he was going to get to eat! Lol) He thanks you too!"
31550,25885,2002-09-17,5,"This didn't last long in our house!  Very yummy, very bananay banana bread."
230912,25885,2011-10-14,5,Delicious!  I used 3 small bananas and 2 small apples!  I also added some vanilla :)
24565,25885,2002-09-23,4,I really like the flavors in this banana bread.  The butter and the brown sugar are a nice change from most recipes I tried.
19879,210942,2008-01-05,5,"I remember cooking this in the late '70's and then LOST the recipie.  This is FANTASTIC.  Really.  Serve it to Company.  It does not really matter how many shrimp exactly you have, just mush them on in there and cover them well."
184763,210942,2008-12-11,5,"I made this for a lunch pot luck today and it was super easy and very tasty. There weren't any leftovers! I did shell the shrimp before baking them, and used about 10 ounces of the dressing."
1170224,210942,2009-07-04,4,"I made this last night and I thought it was a bit salty. But, that could have been the brand of the dressing I used. It was not the brand I normally buy.
Next time I will use less dressing, 16 oz, why to much for me.  Others might like that much for dipping. It was good and very easy to prepare."
386585,210942,2009-07-13,4,"Well, it couldn't be simpler, although I had some trepidation putting in the oven covered in dressing and butter!  It was pretty tasty, though.  I think I could easily double the shrimp or reduce the dressing and butter, because this made a LOT of extra juice. While I could have used all of the bread to soak it up, I was already suffering a guilty conscience. I actually poured it in a container to save as marinade.  Thanks for posting this, my fellow Gnome!"
381180,210942,2011-04-07,5,"DELICIOUS!!  Bibs and lots of napkins are recommended!  I only used 2 teaspoons butter, and added a dash of garlic powder and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes to the Zesty Italian dressing ~ Baked the shrimp in their shells for 15 minutes at 350F.  Made for Spring PAC Orphanage 2011."
189280,210942,2011-08-04,4,"This is delicious and very easy to make. Sounds unusual, but works very well. Thanks for posting!<br/>Update: For 3/4 pounds shrimp, I used 1/2 bottle of dressing and about 6 TBS butter.  I also added in small grape tomatoes and white mushrooms, quartered and we had plenty of sauce."
501727,210942,2011-12-13,0,I make something similar but double the shrimp and add juice of 1 lemon and 2 TBS of pepper.  Please cook in the shells...that makes the recipe!
1900691,210942,2014-05-19,5,I used 2 lb of frozen shrimp. I thawed and rinsed the shrimp (peel and eat) dumped in a casserole dish dumped the dressing (16 oz) and added a few pat&#039;s of butter baked at 350. for 7 minutes stirred and baked 4-5 minutes more. Served with garlic bread. I thought it would be really tart like vinegar but it wasn&#039;t I think the butter toned it down. VERY GOOD! so easy.
33254,25885,2002-10-11,5,THE best banana bread .I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves.Had some the next day and it was still lovely and moist.Will make this often!
108460,25885,2004-08-23,5,My boyfriend gave this 5+ stars.  It had a wonderful flavor but I am still stuck on my grandma's recipe.  I will definately make this again for my spoiled boyfriend.  Thanks!
53053,25885,2002-12-19,0,"I loved this recipe and have made it three times already. It's a great ""meet the new neighbor recipe"". I always double the recipe and keep a loaf for me.  I cook one loaf 65 minutes and the other loaf 60 minutes (I like the middle to be just slightly mushy.)  Thanks for sharing!"
57397,25885,2003-01-05,4,"The bread turned out really moist, because of all that banana.  My rough estimation just equated it as 5 bananas.  :)  And the colour turned out really nice.  I added a couple of slices on the top just for a nice visual effect.  Also dusted a little bit of cinnamon powder on the warm bread.  "
10404,25885,2003-01-05,5,"Excellent Banana Bread!  The flavor was wonderful, the bread dense but moist,and it made a full loaf.  Nice dome on the top that didnt crack and explode like lava, and was a lovely golden brown.  The only thing that I will add next time is a cup of chopped walnuts-my preference!  Thank's so much for sharing this recipe!  Di Neal"
52543,25885,2003-01-23,5,"Since I only had 3 bananas that were overly ripe (and I couldn't wait to try this recipe), I ""nuked"" 2 non ripened bananas to get the required amount.
I'm so glad I did as it was awesome!!! I will be making this again VERY SOON.  "
9869,25885,2003-02-10,5,"absolutely divine! Wonderful aroma great tasting, moist,and so easy to make banana loaf, cant ask for anything better than that!"
45999,25885,2003-04-19,5,"This is a good, very moist banana loaf.  However, I will likely go back to my old recipe which is the same as Sour Cream Banana Bread #28013."
76015,25885,2003-04-30,5,"An absolutely great recipe. I did a few variations with the one batch. I cooked a loaf, and with the excess made mini-banana-bread-muffins, which I put walnuts into. 
Despite the fat content, this was the absolute best recipe and was absolutely delish with or without the walnuts.
Very easy to slice too, which can be a problem with some banana breads.
Thanks!"
51257,25885,2003-06-06,5,"I made this last night and it is hands down the best banana bread I have ever tasted.  It is so moist, mine took alot longer than 65 minutes to bake but it was worth the waiting.  I did add 1 cup of chopped nuts to mine.  Great recipe thanks for posting."
92264,25885,2003-07-20,5,"This is not banana bread, this simple delicious recipe goes far beyond that. I'm thinking culinary perfection. I just had to add about 3/4 cup of coarsly chopped dates. It smelled so good I just couldn't wait for it to cool properly. My low fat diet of course is right out the window... tomorrow I have a session with my dietician; I'll confess my sin then, hee hee. Wonderful recipe, Shelley, thank you for posting it."
51655,25885,2003-08-03,5,"kind of silly to place a review when there are a hundred of them saying the same thing, but YUM! 
my mom is allergic to milk and I was trying to find a nice recipe she could eat. Excellent! She asked me to email her the recipe today.
Thank you"
56670,25885,2003-08-20,4,"This was good......very ""banana"" just like the title says...not overly sweet...."
64203,25885,2003-08-28,5,"I am often disappointed in the banana breads I try because it lacks true banana flavor. Well, this banana bread was by FAR the BEST banana bread I've ever made! Perfect flavor, great consistency and easy to follow recipe. I did add a Tsp of vanilla and cooked for approx 70 minutes.
Thanks for the great recipe! I'm sure to use it again and again and again!"
64934,25885,2003-09-08,5,"I had four black bananas and was looking for a loaf recipe when I found this one.  I had to add a ""non ripe"" banana to make up the right amount, but it turned out great!  I also threw in a handful of chopped walnuts!   The loaf was very moist inside while the outside was just right.. not soggy!!  I'll certainly be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!"
43921,25885,2003-09-09,5,"This is wonderful bread -- so moist and banana-y!  I always add cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to mine so I did it to this recipe as well.  Turned out great.  Thanks!"
18391,25885,2003-09-15,5,Good recipe I will make it again! thank you
93006,25885,2003-09-15,5,"Why compromise is right!  I, too, think the brown sugar adds something special.  It was so nice to enjoy a very moist ""plain"" banana bread - no nuts, no chocolate chips, etc.  My kids loved it!"
65618,25885,2003-09-25,5,"I thought I haad been using the best banana bread recipe for years, UNTIL I TRIED THIS! WOW!!  After reading a few reviews indicating problems with cooking times, I did make an adjustment by tripling the recipe and putting the batter into 4 pans.  It was perfect.  In fact, it baked much more evenly that my old standby ever did.

104295,25885,2003-09-26,5,"This had wonderful flavor!  I had defrosted all my frozen bananas and found that I had so many I needed something that took a ton of them.  I hypothesized that with this many bananas I wouldn't need all the fat and I was correct.  I used half the fat, and since I was almost out of butter I used oil.  A fabulous flavor and the kids love it!"
67899,25885,2003-09-29,5,"This might just be the best banana bread I've ever had. I have another recipe I really like, but I'd been having problems with the middle not cooking through, so I decided to give this one a try. I'm so glad I did! I didn't have any problems at all. I used 5 very ripe bananas, and it was perfectly done in my oven after only 50 minutes. I'll definitely be making this one again!"
51436,25885,2003-10-08,5,This is the most delicious banana bread EVER! I buy extra bananas just so they'll brown up so I can make some of this sumptious treat.
107957,25885,2003-10-14,5,"Very Moist and Smooth, the best tasting banana bread I have tried in a while.

Great recipe, It was my pleasure to use my stock of over-riped bananas!"
73836,25885,2003-10-16,5,"Made this the other day and found it to be a lovely, delicious and moist banana bread.  I added about a cup of chopped walnuts. I think next time I will try throwing in some chocolate chips as well!  Thanks for a great recipe!"
3288,25885,2003-11-12,5,"After all the reviews I couldn't halp but try this.  What a wonderful Banana Bread! The flavor was great, the bread dense and amazingly moist,and it made a full loaf. Beautiful color with a nice shaped dome.  I was sure it wasn't going to set up but it ended up perfect. Thanks for the recipe"
91867,25885,2003-11-18,4,"This banana bread was really good.  It wasn't quite sweet enough for us, but I think that is because my bananas were not ripe enough.  I reheated the bread in the toaster oven with some butter and it was wonderful.  
I think that next time I will add some cinnamon or nutmeg for a little extra flavor. "
65526,25885,2003-12-16,5,AMAZING bread!!! Better the next day. I threw out my mom's recipe! Happy Holidays!
68588,25885,2003-12-28,5,"Good recipe, I enjoyed it very much. Very easy to make also. Thanks"
109912,25885,2004-01-10,4,"This was a very dense, very flavorful banana bread.  I prefer mine a bit on the lighter side, but this sure won on taste."
74028,25885,2004-01-16,5,My DH likes this so much I keep a loaf baked all the time so he can take a few slices to work.  Really a good bread!
109938,25885,2004-01-25,5,Very excellent recipe!  Had a tried and true banana bread recipe which has now been replaced. This was awesome! Thanks for the post.
108913,25885,2004-01-30,5,This bread is excellent! I made it into 3 mini-loaves so I wouldn't be tempted to eat the whole thing after baking. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup almond meal instead of all purpose flour.
126119,25885,2004-02-15,4,"Awesome, Its one of the best ive tasted im only 11 and i think it was easy to make and good to taste! I sound funny but its good!"
40152,25885,2004-02-19,5,"This is a delicious banana bread. I was a little short on banana by about l/3 of a cup but it still turned out wonderfully moist and tasty. 
 I added about 3/4 of a cup of blueberries which tasted great and also was visually pleasing. (Dusting the blueberries with flour help distribute them nicely) 
Thank you for a great recipe. "
34930,25885,2004-03-14,5,"This was super easy and YUMMY! For extra fun, I added 1/4 C of mini chocolate chips."
124864,25885,2004-03-22,5,"Great bread! I put the dough in muffin tins/foils and cooked for 25 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I also substituted 1 cup spelt flour and 1 cup kamut for the 2 cups flour, added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 cup walnuts. Yum Yum!"
102859,25885,2004-03-23,5,"This loaf is the gold standard against which banana breads should be judged. This recipe was so simple to follow but produced such a wonderful treat. DD took a slice to school and now has her friends begging me to bake this for them. The key to my success was this wonderful recipe, to which I added five very ripe bananas, mini chocolate morsels and walnuts. Great job, Shelley!"
111342,25885,2004-03-25,5,"AWESOME.  super easy, ingredients most everyone would have on hand.  i admit, the crust getting so brown made me nervous, but it was awesome.  nice and firm on the outside but SUPER moist on the inside.  i kept a pretty close eye on mine (i don't trust my dang electric oven) and in my oven, 45 minutes and it was done.

i will now be looking FORWARD to no one eating the bananas in my house...then we get to make this WONDERFUL bread the whole family loved."
39070,25885,2004-04-01,5,"This is very good, nice and moist, and very easy to make. I like using the brown sugar instead of the white. The boys gobbled it up. "
89015,25885,2004-04-04,5,I used this batter to make muffins this morning.  Very good.  They baked about 17 minutes.
104301,25885,2004-04-06,4,"The best recipe for banana bread that I have tried in a very long time.  
Not only can you add nuts but try coconut or pineapple instead for a tropical taste!"
8688,25885,2004-04-11,5,"An absolutely delicious banana bread with all that is promised!  I used 4 very large, overly ripe bananas which did not prove to be 2 1/3 cups, so I added just enough sour cream to make up the difference.  I also added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to the mix. The end result was fabulous!  I knew with all these reviews, I couldn't go wrong ; )  Thanks for the lovely banana bread, Shelley~by the sea!"
72386,25885,2004-04-12,5,This is heaven in a pan. Thanks so much for the recipe. It's a hit with my family!
90324,25885,2004-04-12,5,Dont know if you will ever get around to reading this as there are so many other reviews before mine.  I made this delicious banana bread last week and all I can say is Yum Yum & Thank You.
35267,25885,2004-04-16,5,"I have made several banana bread recipes over the years, but this is by far the best! I have made it at least 3 times in the last 45 days for my boys. Very flavorful and moist. I add 1/2-1 cup of chopped walnuts. It goes quickly!"
122276,25885,2004-04-17,5,"SO good!  I cooked two 9x5 loaves for 40 minutes because I didn't want the regular size loaf.  When cool, I made little cream cheese sandwiches, cut in half and served as a snack.  I will be keeping this nice moist recipe for future use!"
55578,25885,2004-04-21,5,Absolutely divine!!!!!
94618,25885,2004-04-24,5,This banana bread is PERFECT.  Every recipe I tried before I either didn't care for the flavor or I couldn't get the cooking time right.  Baked this in my new stoneware loaf pan - the flavor is out of this world!  The outside browned nicely while the inside stayed moist.  Thanks so much for posting!
37950,25885,2004-04-25,5,"After seeing all the great reviews, I had to buy bananas just to let them go overripe to make this bread! It turned out fabulous. I was surprised at all the creamy banana ""pockets"" inside the bread...made it much more delicious and interesting than regular banana bread. As my 2 year old said upon taking a bite, ""Mmmm...this is SO good!"""
124434,25885,2004-04-26,5,We loved everything about this banana bread!
39341,25885,2004-04-27,5,"Like it needs one more review- but very good, loved by all, used a total of 8 banana's though!! "
80778,25885,2004-04-29,5,"Best, and moistest banana bread I've ever had.  The only thing I changed is that I didn't use the traditional loaf pan.  My family can't eat that much at one time, so I used smaller tins.  I used 4 but should only have used 2 or 3, probably just 2.  The loaves turned out very small, but the taste was still fantastic.  I will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks for posting!"
126618,25885,2004-05-03,3,"It might just be me, but this bread was only OK.  It wasn't bad, but I won't make it again and will keep looking for my perfect banana bread recipe"
116819,25885,2004-05-06,2,This banana bread was ok.  I don't think I'll be making it again
8526,25885,2004-05-08,4,This was absolutely wonderful. Not dry at all! I did add cinnamon to the flour mixture and emptied 2 vanilla beans into the butter mixture. I think all banana bread recipes need vanilla and cinnamon. This will replace my old recipe for sure. Thank you very much for posting.
104902,25885,2004-05-10,5,Great banana bread (even better eaten warm). I cut the margarine in 1/2 and added pecans - very good!
79772,25885,2004-05-11,3,"The bread sliced nicely but the taste was just ordinary. Nothing great for us, sorry...

I added chocolate chips and raisins. "
58852,25885,2004-05-15,5,This is indeed the best banana bread I have EVER made!  Thanks!!
71460,25885,2004-05-16,5,This was a great recipe!  I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour and half of the butter with applesauce to cut down on the fat.  I also added a few chopped walnuts.  It was really moist and delicious with a great banana flavor.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.
47559,25885,2004-05-24,4,"I made the recipe exactly as written, using four large over ripe bananas, and baked it for 60 minutes.  It produced a nice height and good color.  It's extremely moist, dense, and has a good banana flavor. "
54989,25885,2004-06-05,5,"Excellent bread! I only had self raising flour, so I used 1 1/2 cups of it + 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, only used 4 bananas because that's what I had (but they were REALLY ripe), cut down the butter a little, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. It smelled delicious and tasted even better, thanks!"
125773,25885,2004-06-11,5,"Very Yummy!!! This is the best banana bread I have ever made. It is so moist. So moist, and the house smells wonderful while baking. I found this a very easy recipe. I will bake this most often. Will make mini loaves as gifts. Thanks for sharing."
75473,25885,2004-06-27,5,Wonderful Bread...love to use lots of banana in my bread!  Thanks for a new favorite!  :)
68960,25885,2004-07-10,5,What more can I say.  This is fantastic and a great way to use up alot of bananas.  Next time will use muffin tins.  Will be making this again and again.  Thanks for posting.
35526,25885,2004-07-19,5,"We really enjoyed the full flavor of this bread.  I will add nuts next time but had a guest that does not enjoy them so alas, we were nutless this time.  Good recipe, I will make this again."
42843,25885,2004-08-04,4,"I love recipes that use ingredients that I always have in the house, and this is one of those. It made a very moist banana bread. I followed the directions as written and next time I will add some chopped walnuts and cinnamon."
139004,25885,2004-08-11,4,"Pretty darn good.  I made one following the recipe and I adapted one to be reduced-sugar, reduced-fat, and vegan.  The vegan one was hands down out of this world!  I used applesauce and plum baby food instead of the butter and reduced the sugar, and egg replacer."
34725,25885,2004-08-15,5,"This was a wonderful, simple recipe. I read some of the reviews and tried adding a bit of applesauce to replace some of the butter and also threw in a bit of cinnamon and vanilla. I really enjoyed this and it was a hit for breakfast when the rest of the family woke up to the lovely, inviting smell. I'll be making this again for sure. Thanks, Bet"
117235,25885,2004-08-21,5,"I thought I would have enough bananas with 4, but that only made 2 cups, so I made it with only 2 cups of banana. I added two dashes of cinnamon and added walnuts and a little vanilla.  It tasted great and was easy to make.  My oven is a little fast so it got a little dark, but the flavor was great."
128473,25885,2004-09-13,5,"Thank you so much Shelley-By-The Sea for sharing this amazing recipe. We all really enjoyed this moist and tender treat.The overall flavour was intense but not over powering. I will definitely be making this again,its a keeper. I didn't even have to use my MIL's secret for making moist banana bread. (you wrap the warm bread in tinfoil as soon as it comes out of the oven to keep it moist) Your bread was moist all on its own. Kudo's.... BK"
163793,25885,2004-09-22,5,"Wondeful. I did mess it up a bit as my 13 month old was climbing mount mum. I was planning on using oil instead of butter and forgot to add it. I doubled the recipe and made choc. chip muffins with half and a loaf with the other half. The muffins were moist inside and crispy outside after 25 minutes and the loaf was done after 60 mins. I cooked it in the middle of the oven and it did not get overly brown. Lovely smell, great professional looking muffins and a nice springy texture. Awesome!"
46353,25885,2004-10-10,5,I have never made a good banana bread and I can't take credit for making this one but my hubby made it and it was so great. The house smelled so good. Nice and moist. He was short 1/3c. of banana so this time he bought extra ones so as soon as they ripen he will go at it again. Thanks
146958,25885,2004-10-12,5,"Excellent!  I used 5 medium sized bananas which went a bit over the amount you specified, but the loaf turned out perfectly.  I may get wild next time I make it and add some banana extract for just a bit more banana punch. This would also be terrific with dried fruit and nuts (or chocolate chips!) added.  Loved the texture and homey warmth right out of the oven.  Thanks!"
165841,25885,2004-10-14,5,I made muffins with your recipe and they are wonderful! Nice and moist. I filled the tin very full to make large muffins and was concerned about the cooking time (did not want them raw inside) but after approx 27 minutes they came out great.  I made 12 muffins but could have made more if I did not fill them so full. I will definately hang on to this recipe - Thanks!
63146,25885,2004-10-21,5,"Wow, excellent Banana Bread.  Very moist and tasty.  I wouldn't change a thing except maybe add nuts or chocolate chips if I were so inclined.  Thanks for a winning recipe!!"
167059,25885,2004-11-02,5,"This is a fantastic cake!  I made it with the recommended ingredients the first time - great - then modified it so my son (lots of allergies) could enjoy it too.
I replaced the egg with substitute, butter with marg, and flour with gluten free mix.  It is THE only cake that still tastes delicious after substition.
Thankyou very much!"
171920,25885,2004-11-08,5,Absolutely delicious.  I am having a nice warm slice at this moment.  I added some chopped walnuts and baked two mini loaves.  I actually mashed the bananas using my hands and there are nice chunks of banana throughout the loaf.  I'll be making this again and taking them to share with the office on those cold mornings.
48944,25885,2004-11-08,5,"This bread was SO moist, it was like eating banana pudding.  I brought it to work, and two guys wouldn't try it, saying they didn't like banana bread, but because everyone was raving about it, they finally tired it, and now they are begging me to make more and bring it in again.  Definitley a keeper!"
138047,25885,2004-11-11,5,You really don't need my review but I have to say that this has now replaced my regular Banana bread recipe. I only had 4 bananas but it was still really moist.I also added a touch of cinnamon which was delicious.DH loved it so much that he's asked me to make one for the staff at his surgery!
124190,25885,2004-11-11,5,"Very, very moist. Hubby and son loved it. It almost overflowed an 8.5x4.5 pan. Outside was almost crunchy, but center was as moist as can be. It took me 6 bananas to get the amount needed. Thanks! It was really good!"
164182,25885,2004-11-11,5,"Ditto, moist and wonderful."
111347,25885,2004-11-18,5,This was the easiest banana bread recipe that I've ever tried!  It turned out delicious!  Thank you for sharing!
169584,25885,2004-11-22,5,"Delicious banana bread.  We all love banana bread and this is the best one we've had.  It is really moist with lots of taste.   
I will definitely use this recipe again!"
107060,25885,2004-11-30,5,"This recipe is fantastic!  Me and my step daughter really enjoy making it.  It's simple, basic ingredients that are normally around the house and the flavour is delicous.  Moist, full of banana flavour and I usually get it to come out with a sweet-crunchy top crust. Yum!  This is the ONLY banana bread recipe I'll ever use (memorized by now from making it so many times).  I made 4 loaves the first week I had the recipe.  Thanks for sharing with us!"
56087,25885,2004-12-05,5,"Replacing my old Banana Bread recipe with this one.  My 6 year old Grandson, who won't eat Bananas, let alone the bread, has eaten 2 slices.  His Mom couldn't believe it.  GREAT texture.  GREAT flavor.
Thanks for sharing."
49304,25885,2004-12-06,5,"Great, Moist, tasty, delicious banana bread. This recipe will be a regular in our house. Thank you so much for posting the recipe."
146486,25885,2004-12-07,5,This has a good texture and perfect banana flavor.  Mine was done after 45 minutes though so watch the bake time.  
178702,25885,2004-12-07,5,"This was a great rtecipe. Our local supermarket sells bananas when they are spotty(I like them this way best)  and they sell  them like 5 lbs for 25 cents, so I am always  buying these things and challenging myself on how to use them up. This recipe  fit the bill nicely. I doubled the recipe, and found after I had  mixed everything  I didn't have two loaf pans, so I used a pie plate and hoped it would work out. It did, and they were both ready after 45-50 minutes. Also, I didn't have enough brown sugar so I used regular sugar, and it worked out fine also. I have had a loaf devoured hot out of the oven, and one for the rest of the week, and I will be baking tons of these for the freezer. Thanks for sharing!"
166337,25885,2004-12-08,4,Very nice banana flavor and wonderful texture.
179471,25885,2004-12-14,5,"This bread is incredible. I look forward to making it over and over again! I added a little cinnamon and a tiny bit of nutmeg. My husband gobbled it right up. My only regret: I didn't have enough Bananas for more than one loaf. I will be making these again as muffins and loaves several times. It was so moist and rich. Just the best I have ever had! Took a little longer than the designated time to get done, but that could just be my stove. Everyone MUST try this recipe! "
37636,25885,2004-12-16,5,"Very moist and delicious! I was actually surprised at how many bananas it took to come up with 2 1/3 cups, since I thought 3 big bananas would do it. (NOT) I was lucky enough to have a couple of ripe bananas tucked away in the freezer (you can save ripe bananas, peeled, in a ziplock bag in the freezer for later), because it took 5 bananas total- otherwise I would not have had enough. This bakes up nicely, although anyone who cooks this less than 65 minutes and calls it pudding doesn't have pudding but underdone banana bread. With 5 bananas, the batter is extremely moist, and I had to bake this not only the full 65 minutes, but for a whopping 20 minutes more, for a total of 85 minutes. The bread does get pretty brown cooking this long, but does not burn (see my pic). If one is concerned, they might think to shield the top of the bread with foil, rather than serving this raw. I love the flavor in this, and for one of the few times in my life can agree with why a recipe is on the top recipes list (<G>). I love nuts, so next time, I may add some of those as well (probably chopped toasted pecans), but will definitely make again, and often! Thanks for posting."
176615,25885,2004-12-26,5,"Beautiful, moist banana bread with loads of banana flavor and a crisp crust. I really prefer the flavor of butter and brown sugar to regular banana bread with oil and white sugar. Used 5 medium bananas and baked for 85 minutes and it was perfect. Thanks, Shelley by the sea, we'll be having this often!"
46849,25885,2004-12-26,5,"Just finished off the first bite of this banana bread, and IT IS WONDERFUL!  I did have to cook it an hour and 15 minutes, and I added 1 tsp vanilla, a bit of mace, and some cinnamon.  Just Perfect!"
181912,25885,2004-12-30,4,"it was good, I like mine sweeter, but the wife loved it"
151638,25885,2005-01-03,5,"This bread was the best bread I have ever made. I didnt use nut , but everything I used. The bread was very moist and u could taste the banana , I used 3 cups of banana's. I would make this cake again and again!!!!!!!!"
184081,25885,2005-01-14,5,"This was my first banana bread. After reading all the great reviews for this recipe I just had to try it and I'm so glad I did. Absolutely delicious and a definite keeper. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, pinch of nutmeg, pinch of cinnamon and used six bananas if I'm remembering correctly. Also baked for approx 20 minutes longer than stated time just to be sure the inside wasn't going to be mushy. The flavour is beautifully bananarish and the texture just perfect. Thanks so much for this wonderful and easy to follow recipe. Will be making again and again!"
98580,25885,2005-01-16,5,"Hi Shelley:
This was THE best banana bread that I have ever made. At first, I thought it wasn't done, as it was so moist and soft inside.  My  kids loved it. My husband doesn't usually care for banana bread, but he was the one who ate most of it, and was looking for more the next day.  Yesterday, when we went shopping, we loaded up on the bananas, as I will be making this often. Thank you for posting your fantastic recipe."
64583,25885,2005-01-20,5,This is a great recipe.  I did like a couple other reviewers did and made them into muffins which baked for 30 minutes.  They're full of banana flavor and very moist.
115658,25885,2005-01-20,0,"I justmade this recipe again, and yes, It was excellent, But this time I used 100% whole wheat flour, and it was still moist and wonderful. "
187327,25885,2005-01-23,4,"While I find most banana breads a bit too dry, this one was very moist. The only thing I will do differently next time is add more sugar. But I will definately keep this in my cookbook file."
135870,25885,2005-01-26,5,I had to try this banana bread with so high a rating and I was not disappointed.  I found the recipe very tasty and moist.  I hate a dry bread.  I'll keep this permanently in my cookbook and use it when I see my bananas going bad.  I may try to experiment around and use half whole wheat and whole all-purpose the next time.  I had to use 6 bananas to get the require 1 1/3 cups.
134289,25885,2005-02-13,5,Delicious and so easy!!!  I had 4 large bananas that were going to go bad if I didn't use them.  This recipe was a cinch to make.  I had all the ingredients. This one is a keeper!
140806,25885,2005-02-14,5,This banana bread is moist and not too sweet. The only thing I did differently was added a touch of vanilla extract. This recipe will be made over and over in my home.
24386,25885,2005-02-17,4,"I expected this to have an intense banana flavor because of the amount used (6 bananas to make the 2 1/3 cups), but it was rather a bland taste.  After 55 minutes of baking, the center was still soft, yet the rest was very brown.  I would advise taking this out of the oven at this point for moistness sake.  I baked it for 60 minutes and it became rather dry. Added chopped walnuts and like others, I think it also needs the vanilla extract.  Thanks for posting."
147323,25885,2005-02-23,5,"This banana bread was great!  Super easy to make, too, which is a plus with my schedule!  I did add a little bit of cinnamon to the second loaf I made, and it seemed to give it that missing 'something'.  It turned out WONDERFUL.  Thank you for posting such an awesome recipe!"
147145,25885,2005-03-02,5,"Here's yet another 5 star review for this recipe. My cake turned out moist and dense. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 8x4 pan. It took 63 minutes to cook and browned just right on top. I also added the following extras - some toasted pecans, half a teaspoon vanilla extract, a dash of cinnamon and a sprinkle of brown sugar on top before baking. I used 2½ large overripe bananas. One thing to note would be - this is not a very sweet banana bread. If you like yours sweet increase the sugar. Thanks for a lovely recipe!"
42367,25885,2005-03-03,5,"This is a very moist bread.  Not overly sweet but just right.  A nice way to use up bananas.  I did add walnuts, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a dash of nutmeg.  I baked it for 65 minutes.  It came out just right."
191436,25885,2005-03-04,5,Just made this for the second time. I made mini-muffins this time and it only took 25 minutes to bake. My DD will be so happy when she gets home from school. She loves banana bread!
53511,25885,2005-03-09,5,Wow - my new and ONLY banana bread recipe from here on out - it was DELICIOUS!!  I topped mine with crumb topping before baking - yum!  It makes the whole house smell good and it tastes incredible - thanks Shelley!
130663,25885,2005-03-23,5,Very good bread.Will make again.
202202,25885,2005-04-05,5,"Mine did not come out as moist as I thought it would but that is because I didn't have butter so I used canola oil and didn't use as much as I should have.  Then I think I left it in too long.  My daughter has been eating it all up.  It is a very tasty bread I will try again with butter.  I also added vanilla.
"
140331,25885,2005-04-07,5,"Had to try this since I saw all the positive feedback.  I'm another one on the long list.  I had 6 bananas that were over ripe and didn't want to toss them.  All I added was tsp. of vanilla and baked my loaf 60 minutes.  Perfect, I didn't even wait for it to cool as I cut a chuck off the eat and enjoyed!"
209938,25885,2005-04-16,5,This is the best banana bread ever. Made it at 330 gone by 545.  My family loved it.  It was absolutly moist and wonderful.  Added a little vanilla as suggested.
208272,25885,2005-04-20,5,"I agree with all the rest...easy & fantastic!  I substituted half the flour for almond meal (sold at trader joe's), added a dash of vanilla, cinnamon & nutmeg - the results were amazing & so moist!"
26942,25885,2005-04-29,5,This maybe the best recipe on recipzaar.....
126032,25885,2005-05-04,4,"This was a good, moist banana bread.  I baked for 60 minutes and I think that was a little too long in my oven because it turned out very brown on the top (but still moist on the inside). Also, next time I will try adding nuts.  Good recipe!"
206969,25885,2005-05-09,5,"WOW! I have tried at least five different recipes for banana bread, and this is absolutely THE best! I added nuts as we love nuts in bread and it turned out just great. Thanks Shelley for the best banana bread recipe ever!"
215601,25885,2005-05-14,5,"as the other viewers noted this is the best, i also do this in muffin tins, as i freeze a portion, thanks"
188204,25885,2005-05-14,5,Great flavor and easy to make. The only thing I will do next time is cook a little longer.  I also added chopped walnuts and added 1 tsp. vanilla
129902,25885,2005-05-15,5,Great recipe.  I used half the suggested butter and then added apple sauce to reduce the fat. Still very moist. 
75146,25885,2005-05-22,5,This recipe was very easy to make. I did not have enough bananas however so used fewer. It is still a very moist banana bread. It is so good! 
167522,25885,2005-05-23,5,"Loved this!  I added a few more bananas and some vanilla and cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and it turned out lovely!  My picky 19 month old ate it up!!!  Thanks!  Wonderful with peanut butter on top!  :)"
113108,25885,2005-05-25,5,Good banana-ey bread.  I added 1 cup of walnuts and some cinnamon.  Great flavor and very moist.
217137,25885,2005-05-26,5,"This is the best Banana banana bread recipe that I have used and it disappeared Quite fast unlike others I have tried. The bread is Very Moist and full of Flavor. Also, it is easy to make. I am very pleased and thank you"
173085,25885,2007-07-26,5,Wonderful!  The bread was moist and very yummy!  I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg as other reviewers suggested and it's fantastic!
84457,25885,2005-05-31,5,"Excellent banana flavor.  Easy to do recipe.  I used bananas ripened to the black soft stage, it turned out extremely moist, but not soggy.  I also subbed 1/2 c. egg substitute for the 2 eggs and Smart Balance for the butter (I always bake with it in my pound cakes.)  I also tried someone's idea for using muffin tins, regular and minis.  Be sure to shorten the baking time.  Just for fun, I stirred in whole Hershey's Kisses into half of the batter.  The end product was a light golden brown.  They were wonderful!!  Try this recipe, you will be glad you did!"
27395,25885,2005-06-04,5,"YUMMY!! This is one of the easiest and best banana breads I have ever had! I did bake for an extra 10 minutes, and it was perfectly brown on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. Great spread with cream cheese. The banana flavor is fabulous!Thanks for posting!
~Manda"
75011,25885,2005-06-06,5,"Amazingly delicious. Even though I made several mistakes (wrong size pan, too few bananas), it was moist and delicious. I will be making this again next week when I have company (Only this time I will do it right!)"
206101,25885,2005-06-11,4,"This was really good, and not overly sweet! Thanks! :)"
209942,25885,2005-06-11,4,"Excellent Banana taste... cooking to the time & temp given  this has a dark  crust,almost scorched at the edges...the inside is delicious...I will tent the pan next time... "
218119,25885,2005-06-12,4,"I forgot to add that instead of loaves, i made mini muffins, which cut the baking time way down to 12 mins!  I made a mini loaf as well which took 30 mins to bake. Thanks again."
173355,25885,2005-06-12,4,This is a great recipe. I hate to bake and this was so easy! It tastes great and is so moist. Next time I will use walnuts!
202865,25885,2005-06-15,5,"This banana bread is fabulous!!! I have always found that banana bread taste starchy, but not this one. This one is just great. It's the only way I make banana bread now."
80937,25885,2005-06-24,3,"I was very disappointed after reading all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. When I put the batter in the pan I had a feeeling it was going to be too much to cook thoroughly. I had to cook mine a lot longer and it was very dark with a hard crust when I took it out and the center was still slightly underdone. I also felt it could have used a little more sugar. The banana flavor was a little weak but I think my bananas weren't as flavorful as they could have been, ( I used 5 ). Won't make this again, will keep my old standby recipe. The picture shown with the recipe isn't even close to what mine looked like!"
217724,25885,2005-07-02,4,"This was a challenging one, but worth it. The first time I made it, it was underdone in the middle. The outsides were ok, and the taste was very good so I decided to try it again, and finally determined that baking at 325* for 90 minutes worked alot better for getting done all the way through. It does get a bit dark on the outside, but not enough to burn or affect the taste. We like this one and will make it again."
91724,25885,2005-07-06,0,"After reading all the reviews about this bread taking so long to bake in the middle and the outsides getting over done, I have to pass along my solution. Actually, it is my mom's idea, but I don't know why I never thought of it. Just bake the recipe in a bundt pan, and there is no middle to remain undercooked. Solves the problem beautifully. You can also make muffins like Bogey'sMom did instead of bread, but I really like the bundt solution. I gave up making banana bread years ago because I had the same problem and was tired of gooey centers and too brown edges. My clever mom solved the problem. Try the bundt pan and let me know how it works for you. "
215014,25885,2005-07-06,5,This was a great recipe for me because I have just moved out on mine oven and have had the bananas in the freezer way too long.  Perfect!  I will keep this one around for a long time.
41228,25885,2005-07-07,5,"First off, Shelley - thank you for this recipe - in a word, YUM!  Secondly, thank you kokeshi doll for the idea of the bundt pan - worked great (I uploaded a picture - check it out - there's still steam coming off the cake!)  It took about 40 minutes to bake in the bundt pan and was perfect texture inside and nice-n-crusty outside.  Also, thank you Gato, for the idea of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg - the additions were good ones although next time I'd add even more cinnamon (maybe like 2 tsp) and about 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I'm not sure the vanilla added much - I'll try it without next time.  Also, since I only had 4 bananas, I was a hair short on the 2.5 cups - I think 5 would have been right about on.  Anyhow - all together it's a keeper.  Thank you!"
184579,25885,2005-07-09,5,These made my whole house smell great!  You could even smell them out my front door.  Wonderful recipe.  I did add a little nutmeg and some cinnamon.  To top it off these are easy to make! 
43514,25885,2005-08-04,5,"Have been making this in a bundt pan, with excellent results!  Fabulous banana flavor, better than a breakfast bar, gives hubby his potassium.  Thanks much!"
207318,25885,2005-08-05,5,"I made this recipe tonight.  It is VERY delicious.  Some changes I made: used 1 1/2 C flour and 1/2 C of wheat germ instead of the 2 C flour.  I also ground up about 1/2 tsp fresh cinnamon, which was not nearly enough.  But the product is superb.  I made it in a bundt pan just to see how it would turn out. Pun intended...:)"
546732,25885,2007-07-27,5,"Made yesterday, only i added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, about a 1/4 tsp of fresh nutmeg, and about a cup of blueberries. It was simply amazing."
167849,25885,2005-08-07,5,A+++.  Easy to make.  No fancy ingredients.  No vegetable oil and extra banana make it light and fluffy w/o all the fat.  Brown sugar gives it a nice homey touch.  I added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.
87678,25885,2005-08-09,5,"Great taste!! I added a bit of cocoa powder because I love chocolate.
It was really easy to make and it came out really delicious.
I would dedinately make this again, and serve it with vanilla ice cream on top.
           

                    Joyce 18"
51199,25885,2005-08-14,5,I added two tablespoons of cocoa to this ecipe and it tasted delicious. A great way of using over the top bananas and the kids loved it. Thankyou.
94361,25885,2005-08-20,5,"This was a great recipe! It's not too sweet and not at all tasteless. We substituted margarine for the butter and, after pouring half the batter in the loaf pan, sprinkled in a layer of blueberries followed by the rest of the batter - delicious! "
152393,25885,2005-08-30,5,"I read all of the reviews carefully and this is what I did:
I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the flour mixture.  Then I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the egg/banana mixture.  (I used 4 bananas)  I sprayed a 
Bundt pan with Pam baking spray and poured half of the batter in.  I sprinkled a few blueberries, then added the rest of the batter.  It was perfectly done in 40 minutes.  I put it on a cooling rack and covered it with aluminum foil.  I served it with #39030 Blueberry Sauce.  This turned out so beautiful, moist and delicious!  More like a cake than a bread.  Thank you Shelley for this delicious recipe.

"
175559,25885,2005-09-07,5,this receipe is great. i took the hint from other reviews added freshly grated nutmeg approx 1 teaspoon and only a 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon these are so moist.  I put the prepared batter into mini muffin tins baking time is only 10-12 minutes. made 48 mini muffins.  the family loves them and they are great to put into the kids lunches.  thanks 
153401,25885,2005-09-22,5,I made these last night as a way to use up some very ripe bananas.  I did as several others did and made muffins instead of a loaf.  They turned out very moist.  I loved the use of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I did add about a 1/2 t of vanilla to the mix and was not disappointed.  Thanks for a great recipe.    
220753,25885,2005-10-05,5,"I made this recipe, the only thing is I made muffins and cooked them for 35 minutes and they came out SOOO moist and delicious... Great recipe!"
241346,25885,2005-10-12,5,"This is the best! I tried it with and without vanilla. muffins and bread. It is a very moist, very delicious recipe! I am sure that come Christmas, everyone will want the recipe! thanks!"
202679,25885,2005-10-14,5,"Great Banana bread! It was very moist and the kid's loved it! That, in itself, is a miracle! Thank you for sharing the great recipe! :o)"
153750,25885,2005-10-15,5,"This is Wonderful!!  I came about 1/8 of a cup short of bananas, so I added 1/4 cup of sour cream.  This is the moistest, best tasting banana bread I have ever made!!!"
234062,25885,2005-10-16,5,"A very quick and easy recipe. I halved it as I only had two bananas, and made it into muffins. They were ready in 20 mins and are delicious!"
116009,25885,2005-10-26,5,My 4 children ate very last drop of this in one sitting! DELICIOUS! 
228872,25885,2005-10-27,0,"This recipe is moist and very, very tasty,easy to make, wouldn't change a thing and I sent it to all the cooks in the family.    Their reply was that they agree with this assessment...
JMT-PGH"
27416,25885,2005-10-30,5,"Well, it too me long enough to find out how good this recipe is.  My DW presented me with 3 very ripe bananas and wanted to throw them out.  So I looked up Banana Bread Recipes and decided to try yours.  WOW, how moist and just super great.
I did add 2 more large bananas that were not overripe, and it worked out real well.
I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.
Absolutely excellent. 
I baked 8 in large muffin pans and 1 in a mini bread pan.  The muffins were ready in 30 minutes and the bread pan took an additional 15 minutes. This is now a must to make at least once per month if not more often.
Thank you for posting and sharing this great recipe with us.
""Uncle Bill"""
187453,25885,2005-11-18,5,YUMMY!  Replaced the banana bread recipe I've been using for the last 15 years.  Thanks for sharing.
265686,25885,2005-11-29,0,I divided this into two loaf tins & it turned out fantastic.  It was so easy to make.
220166,25885,2005-11-29,5,"I made this today and it was wonderful!  Instead of making it into one loaf, i used a miniture loaf pan that made 8 small loaves, and they only had to cook for 25 minutes.  My mother makes banana bread every year around this time and this was way better than hers!  (Sorry Mom!)  This is the recipe i'll use from now on."
167028,25885,2005-12-02,5,Excellent! I let it bake for 65 minutes.
27443,25885,2005-12-07,5,"Oh my 
bananas bananas bananas yum yum yum
lovely"
264908,25885,2005-12-08,5,"Wow!  Tasty, moist, just delicious!  I used 5 small bananas, about 2 cups.  That was all I had.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla but I don't know if it made a difference.  Took about 70 minutes to bake.  Do yourself a favor and bake this bread today."
10312,25885,2005-12-13,5,"I wanted to try this recipe because I always have more than 2 over-ripe bananas, and this called for significantly more bananas than the standard banana bread recipe does.  The bread is very soft and cake-like in texture.  I added 2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg from other banana bread recipes because I like those flavors.  I've made this numerous times, so thanks for posting.  I should have rated it sooner."
276629,25885,2005-12-23,3,It was just way to heavy.  I know it has a lot of good ratings but my family and friends agreed the Betty Crocker standard is better.
217726,25885,2005-12-26,5,"This is an excellent recipe! I used a bundt cake pan and added one and a half teas. of vanilla and cinnamon. It cooked for about 50 min.
"
36128,25885,2006-01-02,5,"This is pure heaven!  We had this due to a TON of overripe nanas, and were thrilled to find it.  It has a great banana taste, and was gone within a couple hours of making it.  I took the suggestion of cooking it in my bundt pan, and it turned out wonderfully!  Thanks so much for a winner!!"
243354,25885,2006-01-06,5,"Dear Hubby nearly flipped when I made this for him! I did not have a loaf pan at the time and made it in 2 8x8 square cake pans and baked them for 45 mins. He loved it! Baking the bread this way gave it more area to ""crust over"".  Family ate 1 whole pan right after it cooled. I had to fend them away from the 2nd one so we could have some the next day. I freeze all my overripe bananas until I have enough.  Last time, Hubby took the second ""loaf"" to work with him then had to make copies of recipe for everybody the next day. I also add a little cinnamon from time to time.  "
19280,25885,2006-01-08,5,"The taste of this was great, and it was very easy to make.  I didn't cook it long enough and so there was a somewhat soggy, floury area in the center, but that's my fault!  LOL  Made another one today and cooked it longer; it got VERY brown.  I sent it home with gf, but she'll let me know how it was.  Great,I'me sure!  Thanks for the easy tasty recipe."
279102,25885,2006-01-09,4,Very cake like when made in the bundt pan.  I left some of the banana in chunk form which gave it nice texture.  Very easy to make and goes well with our morning coffee.  I would make this again.
58562,25885,2006-01-30,5,"Amazing!!!!

I have always used mixes to make banana bread for fear of the turn out. I tried this and was amazed. I loved the dense non-cake like texture. I added about a tablespoon of honey and a few chopped dates.I also put a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY! "
160519,25885,2006-01-30,5,"I LOVE this recipe!  I won't eat any other banana bread after finding this.  
I used muffin tins instead of a bundt pan--the muffins bake faster (about 25 to 30 mins.) and they're portable: I pass them out to my family as they're walking out the door for school or work.  They're very dense and full of fruit, so this is a perfect breakfast recipe for energy and such.  Very filling and very good! "
187918,25885,2006-02-09,0,"Since I made some changes to this recipe, I can't give it a star rating.  That would be rating my own recipe, no?
Per other reviewers, I used the flour/oatmeal combo and added cinnamon and chopped pecans. I made muffins. They were delicious. I look forward to making this again!   "
230258,25885,2006-02-15,5,"I love bananas and this is probaly the best banana bread there is!it has great but intense banana flavor!
Thanks for the recipe!"
301202,25885,2006-03-12,5,"Incredible recipe, my wife made 2 loaves of banana bread & I am in love all over again.....so much for the diet!! good times!!"
29314,25885,2006-03-16,5,my daughter bakes mini loaves of this for fund raising-they sell like hot cakes!
140415,25885,2006-03-22,3,I baked this yesterday and i found it to be kinda heavy. I followed the recipe to a T.But my husband still ate it and so did my kids.
30209,25885,2006-03-31,0,"I already rated this, so I won't do that again.  When I don't have enough bananas, I add canned 100% pumpkin to get the desired amount.  It doesn't really change the flavor, but it keeps it really moist.  And, of course, you have to add mini chocolate chips."
248061,25885,2006-04-01,4,"This is my new favorite banana bread recipe.  I added 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t allspice, 1 t vanilla and raisins and my family loved it.  I also made them into 6 large muffins for our churches bake sale.  Excellent!!!"
110135,25885,2006-04-23,4,"Over all a good recipe, but I did miss the spices.  If I make it again, I'll add some cinnamon and nutmeg as previous reviewers suggested."
222564,25885,2006-04-25,5,"All 190 viewers can't be ignored and I too tried this banana bread. The flavor was truly banana and bread wonderfully moist, both due to high banana content. Very basic recipe but good, everyone can add their own bits and pieces to this. I made muffins and iced them with Lynnie the K's Greatest Choklate Icing. Yum!"
310156,25885,2006-05-12,5,I think that this could be the best banana bread in the world!  I could eat the whole loaf in a day.  Yummy!
168125,25885,2006-05-17,5,"This is the ultimate banana bread, the best I have ever had. I have been using this recipe for a few years now, whenever I have very ripe bananas. Sometimes I add chopped walnuts if I have some on hand. "
209743,25885,2006-05-22,5,"Looks, smells, tastes yummy! Thanks for sharing!"
2000224096,25885,2015-08-21,5,"This was a hit in my house. It got gobbled up. In fact, I have another loaf of it baking right now!"
239229,25885,2006-05-28,5,This was wonderful!! I used 5 aluminum foil mini loaf pans and was able to get 20 servings out of this recipe. The only other thing I did differently was to use light butter instead of full fat. This was absolutely delicious and I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!
184529,25885,2006-05-28,5,AWESOME!!! I read a suggestion in another review on using a bundt pan to keep the bread from getting too dark. I tried it and the bread was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe and tip!
322401,25885,2006-06-01,5,"Oh my goodness!  This is the most awesome banana bread recipe ever!  Most recipes I try do not come out the way they are supposed to, but this was great.  I added some cinnamon, vanilla extract, and half a bag of walnuts. It took a little longer(about 20min extra) because I baked it in one of those silicone bundt pans and I had to put some foil on it for the last 20 mintues to keep it from gettin too brown, but that's about all that I did different.  I will make this again and again and I recommend that EVERYONE give this recipe a try.  Absolutely delicious!!"
145830,25885,2006-06-08,1,"I didn't get great results with this bread. It wasn't the tender crumb, power packed banana flavor I've come to expect from a really good banana bread. My family didn't even finish the loaf.  "
225082,25885,2006-06-10,3,This was just okay. Family asked me not to make again.
331278,25885,2006-07-20,4,This was tasty and very moist. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg. I will definitely be making this again when we let our bananas over-ripen.
79888,25885,2006-07-20,5,This was a delicious and moist bread. DH and the fire dept boys loved it. I did feel like it was missing.. something.. I think I'll add a little nutmeg to add some spice next time. I used 5 bananas in mine.. 
298865,25885,2006-08-13,5,Gosh....YUM!  I think I undercooked mine a bit (I've recently moved and now I've got to get used to a new oven) but it was still delicious.  For a super-indulgent treat I spread a thin layer of butter on a slice and ate it with my cup of tea.  Heavenly!
205100,25885,2006-08-17,5,This was delicious!  I added some nutmeg like I saw was recommended in some of the reviews.  My daughter ate it up even though she doesn't care for bananas.  This recipe is very tasty and moist. 
339376,25885,2006-08-20,5,My family loves this in the morning.  It is the best recipe I've found.  Thank you!
59780,25885,2006-08-23,4,"A quick and easy recipe for banana bread. I threw in a handful of cinnamon chips and made everything else as directed. I did have to put it back into the oven to back fully as it was not quite done after 1 hour, but that may be because I did not mash up my bananas enough. "
324069,25885,2006-08-28,5,"Lovely recipe! I didn't have any problems with underdoneness because I read the reviews and after an hour of baking, I turned off the oven and let it set in the cooling oven. Turned out great and the outside was a nice dark golden. My only tweak to this recipe is that I added nuts- I need nuts in my banana bread! lol Thank you Shelley."
339346,25885,2006-08-28,5,"The most favored food in our house is banana bread, so I had to search for the highest rated recipe, which just happens to be yours, and try it.  WOW!!!!! It is wonderful!!!!!  It is the most moist and flavorful banana bread that we have EVER eaten.  The only change that I made was to add a few chopped nuts to one half of the top of the unbaked batter.  My husband and I both prefer walnuts in our banana bread, but our boys don't like them, so I put them on top of ""our half.""  Now everyone can enjoy banana bread just the way they like it because I will only double, triple, or even quadruple this recipe when I make it.  This way, it will last more than 15 minutes.  Shelly by the Sea, you have made a family very, very, very happy tonight!!!!!  "
347416,25885,2006-08-30,5,"This recipe was so easy, fool proof and it was soooo enjoyable, kudos!  "
343888,25885,2006-08-31,5,"I have made a lot of banana bread over the years.  This is, hands down, the best banana bread recipe i have ever used.  Thanks."
188119,25885,2006-09-03,5,very good bread!  I added a tsp of vanilla extract to it also but otherwise didn't change anything.  Thanks!
157080,25885,2006-09-07,5,One of the best banana breads I have ever had. Thank you so much for such a great recipe
152995,25885,2006-09-08,5,"This is the BEST banana bread I've ever had! It's so delicious, moist and it so incredibly easy to make! This will be ""usual"" from now on. Thankyou so much!"
233829,25885,2006-09-10,4,"This was very tasty.  My husband is very picky when it comes to banana bread and rarely compliments me, but this time he did!  I added vanilla extract and chocolate chips.  Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe."
276980,25885,2006-09-10,5,"This was the best banana bread I have ever tried.  I added chopped pecans, cooked the directed amount of time and it was perfectly moist and delicious, even better the second day when we finished it off at breakfast.  It is so quick and easy I will buy extra bananas just so I can let them get overripe and make this again and again.  For those of you who had problems with the timing, I suggest making sure your oven temp is reading correctly. I always have an oven thermometer inside to make sure mine is right."
237330,25885,2006-09-20,5,Delicious! I added 1 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries and it turned out very well. A very moist and easy quick bread.
89831,25885,2006-09-20,3,"This was just okay but nothing over the top special, definately needs more sugar and probably needs some baking powder, it did not rise as much as I expected and was on the heavy side. I might give it a try again with added baking powder and more sugar, when I do I will edit this review. thanks anyway!...Kittencal:)"
344260,25885,2006-09-22,5,"This was a very good recipe.....I had to cook it longer due to using a large loaf pan...I will use this recipe again...Thanks for posting...your friend, Sharon"
336727,25885,2006-09-25,4,This worked out well. I used 1 1/4 cups brown sugar to make it a little more sweet. I also used around a 1/2 cup more mashed bananas.
357204,25885,2006-09-28,4,"This banana bread tasted soooo good, but after 75 minutes at 350, it wasn't even cooked at all in the middle.  The batter was almost overflowing, so I'd suggest using a more shallow, larger diameter pan.  Still, tasted amazing!  I added chocolate chips & trail mix to make it interesting!  GREAT TASTE!"
356592,25885,2006-10-06,5,"here comes number 224 on the rates for this recipe!!!! One word............*AWESOME*
"
25442,25885,2006-10-26,5,Incredible. Thanks for sharing. I made a double batch for two loaves and it turned out perfect. The kids ate it in their lunches instead of sandwhiches. Yummmm.
56061,25885,2006-10-27,5,"There's not much to add that's not already been said about this recipe.  It's the only one we'll ever use.  I don't change a single thing, it's just perfect.  Thanks for posting this!"
135887,25885,2006-10-29,5,Excellent!  I took other reviewer's suggestions and baked in a bundt pan for even baking and added some leftover pumpkin I had in the frig.  Great recipe!
206191,25885,2006-10-29,5,"This was amazing, very moist and still delicious the next day.  I halved the recipe and got about 9 nice size muffins out of it.  Thanks for posting!"
261354,25885,2006-10-29,4,"This bread is tasty and moist. Plus, I love the fact that the ingredients are always on hand. I did make a few changes by adding 1tsp vanilla and 1/2c macadamia nuts for crunch. I also had to bake mines for an additional 20 min. due to a smaller loaf pan. The top of this bread will brown quite a lot and I put foil over the top after it rose so it wouldn't brown too much on top."
229850,25885,2006-10-30,5,"This bread was really yummy. I made several for a bake sale, and sold them all. We really liked this as well. Thanx for posting a great recipe"
32058,25885,2006-11-05,5,"Perfectly moist banana bread.  Used 3 reg bananas, could do even 4 if desired!  Will try toasted pecans with next.  TY for sharing.  "
207176,25885,2006-11-11,5,I LOVE this banana bread! Used 2 ripe bananas I had frozen and then followed the recipe exactly.  I used dark brown sugar and baked it for 1 hour. Perfect! Loved the texture and nice dark color (maybe from the dark brown sugar) but was nice and moist and held up well to slice.  Served it to old friends with coffee this morning.  Thanks a ton!
203362,25885,2006-11-15,5,"mmmmmmm!!!! One of the best banana breads ever!! I used 2 cups of bananas and it was so moist, we ate it in 2 days! :)   thanks!!"
231796,25885,2006-11-21,5,The best banana bread ever.  Thanks Pamela!
365368,25885,2006-11-28,5,I made this and immediately understood why it has so many stars- it's the best banana bread I've ever had.
272752,25885,2006-12-02,5,"Not that this needs another review, but oh, wow.  Had a ton of bananas resulting from a misunderstanding between my roomates about who would buy bananas when, so I looked for the recipie that used the most bananas possible....and the results were great.  Firm, yet moist and incredibly banana-tastic!!!!"
219875,25885,2006-12-04,5,Thanks for posting! I added chocolate chips and dusted it lightly with flour so that it wouldnt sink to the bottom! Loved it!!!
231769,25885,2006-12-15,5,This recipe was so good. You can really taste the bananas. It is embarrassing to admit that my husband and I finished the whole bread in less than 2 hours! I cannot wait for the bananas I have now to overripe so I can bake this again! I added about 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla.
199020,25885,2006-12-24,4,"We thought this banana bread recipe was good, but not really any better than any other banana bread we've tried.  We liked it best toasted with butter."
394077,25885,2006-12-25,3,I tried this recipe twice and both time it came out too dense.  The flavor is good but I still don't like the texture of the bread.
115108,25885,2007-01-01,2,I agree with the other reviewer that this recipe is too dense. I prefer a lighter fluffier banana bread. I think it is just a matter of personal preference. The flavor wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be.
28784,25885,2007-01-22,2,I too thought the texture was gooey and gross.  Not the best banana bread I have had.
366904,25885,2007-01-24,5,"This is a wonderful banana bread, so healthy.  After reading all the comments, I am so glad I followed the advice of cooking the bread in an Angel Food/Bundt pan.  The bread comes out perfect by not baking it in a typical bread pan, but by using a circular pan with a hole in the middle.

I have now made this recipe several times, and all were successful:  1-original recipe, 2-flax seed substitute for eggs, 3-adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts, and 4-flax seed substitute for eggs, adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts, and substituting the flour with whole wheat flour (2 cups minus 4 tablespoons).  Every single time I got raves from the family and friends."
297540,25885,2007-07-31,3,"This is a very moist, good bread.  I made the recipe as printed, and then added one teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon as suggested by previous reviews.  We still thought it was lacking something, but then again with so many great reviews it may be just our taste.  Thanks for sharing your recipe."
437667,25885,2007-01-25,5,"This was the first banana loaf that I have ever made, and it was really great. I had no trouble at all with the consistency of the bread, not even remotely gooey or pudding-like. It really had a great banana taste and was sooooo easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe."
164293,25885,2007-01-26,5,This was excellent!!!  I made a double recipe in a cookie sheet with high sides - it came out perfect!!!  This will be the recipe I always use!!!
140132,25885,2007-01-30,5,"Wow....this was so moist and flavorful that I couldn't stop nibbling.  I doubled the batch and it was gone by nightfall.  If you like bananas, you will love this recipe.  Thank you for such a great bread recipe.....Stephanie"
275438,25885,2007-02-03,5,Really moist and delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!
98919,25885,2007-02-04,5,This one is a keeper for sure!! Thanks for sharing!
230331,25885,2007-02-09,5,I don't know that I have much more to add then what has been said but this is the best.  I have been searching for a banana bread for awhile and have finally found it.  The only thing I like to add is some walnuts because we like nuts and the crunch.
40961,25885,2007-02-11,5,This banana bread is excellent. It's moist and full of delicious banana flavor. I baked it for 60 minutes and it came out perfect. Thanks for sharing. Also the photos are beautiful.
445838,25885,2007-02-12,5,Oh my god this is soooooooo goooood!!!!!!!!!
53959,25885,2007-02-12,5,This was delicious. I needed to use up 5 overripe bananas and this fit the bill perfectly. It was moist and yummy. Next time I make this I might add some chopped nuts for crunch but otherwise it was perfect. Thank you
449748,25885,2007-02-13,4,It was great and very moist on the inside!  So yummy and easy!
308889,25885,2007-02-14,5,This is very delicious banana bread!  I added about 3/4 cup of chopped pecans to add some crunch.  I'll definately be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!
377446,25885,2007-02-14,1,"It's ok, but I'm used to banana bread with more flavor."
168462,25885,2007-02-18,5,Very moist banana bread. Kids really like it with some chocolate chips thrown in. Thanks for the recipe.
105988,25885,2007-02-19,5,"This banana bread is great. Thanks for the delicious recipe. I have already made it twice and I just had to blog about it. I hope you do not mind that I posted a link to your recipe (also from my flickr account). Let me know if I should delete the links. http:// kerstinsklein. blogspot.com/ 2007/02/ edm-84-bread.html http:// www.flickr.com/ photos/ ksklein/ 393304214/

I added some chopped waltnuts and the bread needed 5 more minutes to be done."
180463,25885,2007-02-19,5,I used to use another banana bread recipe and loved it as well.  But I thought I would test out this one.  I will never go back to my other recipe again!  This bread is so moist and so banana-y.  Its great for breakfast or for dessert!
348331,25885,2007-02-25,5,"A great basic recipe, moist and sweet. We doubled the recipe and baked it in three slightly smaller loaf pans, filling about two-thirds full. Baking time was 50 minutes, tented with aluminum foil for the final 10 minutes of baking. Test with a wooden skewer. We added vanilla extract - I imagine it would also be good using almond, or rum extracts. Don't tamper with it too much, its perfect. Kevin"
192974,25885,2007-03-02,5,"This was excellent.  I doubled the recipe and made two huge loaves ( one was supposed to go to the neighbor, didnt get there).  I had to cook mine a bit longer but the pans were huge.  Definate keeper."
274913,25885,2007-03-04,4,"My muffins were moist in the middle, but I should have drastically cut back the baking time. I was worried about UNDERcooking because of the comments, but I think muffins should only bake for 45 minutes at most. Regardless, every last one was gobbled up when I brought these to our colloquium. They are very tasty with coffee.  
PS this made 2 dozen standard sized muffins."
462550,25885,2007-03-08,5,"Easy and great recipe.  I didn't have enough bananna, only 1 1/3 c., so I used 1 cup crushed strawberries also. Voila! Bananna Strawberry Bread.  Yummy!"
405904,25885,2007-03-20,5,"Loved It! So moist!!  I made it to take to work; however, it did not last that long and I had to make another."
278140,25885,2007-04-12,5,Just delicious!  And so easy!  My family loved it!
333562,25885,2007-04-15,4,"The bannas smelled wonderful in the oven! I made these into little mini muffins. They would of taste really good, if i didnt burn them! lol, have to keep my eyes closer to the oven next time. My family didnt seem too crazy about them. The muffins were still delicious. :)"
70643,25885,2007-09-30,4,Very yummy and easy to throw together!  I was out of real butter and had to use tub margarine but it still came out tasty.
295704,25885,2007-04-18,5,"Absolutely Deliciuos! I can't express enough how yummy this recipe is. Although mine came out on the dark side after just 50 minutes, though I don't know if my oven runs on the hot side or cooking them in stones caused it. Next time I will start checking about 30 minutes in. Thanks so much for the awsome recipe....which I will add that if you take the bananas out and add any other kind of fruit, the possibilities are endless.  Thanks Shelley!"
459861,25885,2007-04-24,5,These were great. Thanks for the recipe.
439066,25885,2007-04-25,5,"This is amazing, no wonder it has so many great ratings! If you don't like it you either a) did it very wrong or b) don't like bananas.  To be exact, I had used a TBSP of butter for another recipe and so I used the remaining 7 TBSP from that stick and used 1 TBSP of apple sauce to compensate.  I also used egg substitute.  As a reference, I used 2 large bananas and 2 medium bananas.  I had no idea how many cups 2 large bananas was, but it turned out to be about 1 1/3 cups.  I usually add chocolate chips or nuts to my banana bread, but this time I decided to be a purist, and I was rewarded for my simplicity.  It took my college-dorm-kitchen oven the full 65 mins, though I checked at 60.  Oh yea, and this is only 7 ingredients!  Incredible!  Thanks!"
255338,25885,2007-04-27,5,What makes this one different is the texture of the crust... it's nicely crisp. Wonderful bread. Crispy outside and moist inside. I followed another reviewer's advice and baked in tube pan so I had no problem with burnt top/sides. Thank you for posting.
462074,25885,2007-04-27,5,"Absolutely amazing! My boyfriend hates bananas except for the way his mom makes them in muffins, (loaded with chocolate chips) but we made this tonight and it looked and smelt so good that we could hardly let it cool before we had to taste it. i used a little cinnamon and nutmeg in the mix. i also added walnuts to the top of one half. after it was finished cooking i sprinkled with powdered sugar and the result was fabulous! thank you SO much for a GREAT recipe. =)"
254415,25885,2007-04-30,5,Made into 8 texas size muffins. They freeze and thaw perfectly. Texture is dense and moist. Yummy. Followed up and made banana bread with white sugar instead of brown and 1 tablespoon vanilla plus toasted walnuts. Double yummy.
366672,25885,2007-05-01,5,"Oh My Goodness!! Where has this recipe been hiding all my life? The simplicity and ease of mixing all the ingrediants was so very out of ""character"" with my old (now garbaged banana recipe).. when telling hubby I would join him in a few, was just going to make Banana Bread, he said ""yah okay.. the game will be over by then"" - well what a surprize he got !! Said... you decided not to make it? Told him it was already in the oven and baking!! Reply ""no ways"" (me **giggling**) I did take heed to ""keeping an eagle eye"" on the oven for burning, but, I got lucky! I hardly could wait the 10 mins for cooling time - the outcome was... 5 thumbs up and thank you so much for sharing this recipe!! Absolutely declicious!!"
164890,25885,2007-05-03,4,"This is my ""go-to"" recipe for banana bread.  I think the recipe just needs a bit more salt, otherwise, it's perfect!  So moist, slightly sticky, and oh so yummy!"
303162,25885,2007-05-06,5,I think it's safe to say this will now be my one and only banana bread recipe- YUM!!! I added some mini chocolate chips to perfect it. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!
497609,25885,2007-05-09,5,This is so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!
485497,25885,2007-05-10,5,Banana Banana - so good it HAS to be named twice ^_^
41888,25885,2007-05-11,5,"Thank You Shelly, this is my favorite banana bread to make now--I love that is uses 2 1/3 cups of banana--gives you a chance to use up 4 or 5 instead of throwing out--it is a family favorite"
307532,25885,2007-05-14,5,"WOW! These turned out great! The baking time listed was spot on, and by covering the loaf with foil after 40min it prevented the top from getting too dark. It really does take quite a few bananas to make up 2 1/3 cups, I had to use 7 medium size ones. I 'mashed' the bananas using a hand mixer which is much easier and faster than mashing by hand, and also aerates the mashed bananas making the batter a little lighter. A great recipe and I will definitely be making it again and again."
275316,25885,2007-05-16,5,"I was looking for a good recipe to use up the the 4 really soft bananas on my table. This was the best choice I could have made. It was really fast and easy to throw together with my mixer. Not too many ingredients either. The changes I made were that I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose, and canola oil instead of butter (and I used only half of the amount called for in the recipe). I don't eat eggs, so I used Ener-g egg replacer for those. My bananas only came out to 2 cups worth, but it worked out just fine. Oh yeah, and I made muffins instead of a loaf. The results were golden brown, moist yet springy delicious muffins. I think this will be my banana bread/muffin recipe from now on. Thanks!"
79617,25885,2007-05-17,5,"This is now our staple banana bread and muffin recipe!   

For Christmas, we made this for our neighbors, adding in chocolate chips and marachino cherries.  

(Our local policeman raved -- he even devoured the Christmas loaf I left for him to take to his mom.)

When my daughters and some girl scout friends were working on a cooking badge, I had them use this recipe -- easy, inexpensive, successful, and delicious."
242779,25885,2007-05-17,5,"Can I add my 5 stars to the growing list of great reviews on this bread?  Very, very good and came out perfectly!  This is one of the few banana bread recipes I have tried that didn't call for buttermilk, but this one certainly didn't even need it.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!"
295565,25885,2007-05-19,5,Excellent :)  Defenitely a 5 star recipe!
208755,25885,2007-05-23,5,"Wow, this made even me look good. I used 4 (way ripe and then some) bananas, and it was perfect. Next time I might go with 5. I baked in a silicone loaf pan about 70 minutes, and the sides were dark with just a bit of delicious crust that really added much to the yummy experience. We were both in love. From now on, this is the recipe I'll use for banana bread. Oh, and chopped walnuts - added about a cup, and it was perfect. Thank you for sharing this!"
393426,25885,2007-05-23,5,"Made it in the bundt pan; got rave reviews.  I also made a rum flavored glaze.  I mixed about a teaspoon of imitation rum flavor and 2 teaspoons of milk with as much powdered sugar as I could get to absorb (maybe about 3.4 cup?).  Anyway, I drizzled that over the top, and people commented on how good that was, too."
489929,25885,2007-05-24,0,"This didn't have the flavor that I was expecting.  Pretty mellow...though I only had 3 small banana's. That is probably why mine was dry.

I did add baking powder and 1 cup of brown sugar."
229524,25885,2007-05-26,2,"With all these great reviews I decided to give it a try.  The bread was moist but was lacking in flavor, sorry."
255075,25885,2007-05-30,5,"AWESOME!  Sooo simple to make - my 5yo and 2yo helped me and we had a double batch in the oven in less than thirty minutes.  The whole house smelled like ""grandma's"" house.  It tastes perfect.  Just exactly what banana bread should taste like.  This recipe is a keeper!"
40854,25885,2007-06-01,5,"This was wonderful.  It looked like bananna bread, tasted like bananna bread. It was easy too!  I did make a few changes: I used White Whole Wheat flour, smart balance instead of butter, 1/3 cup of Agave Nector instead of sugar.  Highly recommend it! Thanks, Helen"
318236,25885,2007-06-03,5,"I'm not a huge fan of banana bread, but this is really good.  I made this for my SO, because he loves banana bread, and he thought this was outstanding!"
187281,25885,2007-06-05,2,"My family, who adores banana bread, didn't like this recipe. I have a wonderful gas oven but after 60 minutes that bread was beautifully brown but rather dry.  This is a good recipe if you like to slice a piece for toasting for breakfast or tea but not to eat for a dessert.  We'll likely discard the remaining loaf and make our old stand-by-- Kona Inn Banana Bread-- also posted on 'Zaar.  Thanks for sharing."
315923,25885,2007-06-12,4,"I made this banana bread (I made muffins) twice. The first time I followed exactly but had to use white sugar because I was out of Brown. I also added a splash of vanilla flavoring. IT WAS AMAZING! Light, creamy and soooo banana-y. I loved it. 

I made it the second time and made sure to buy the brown sugar. I followed exactly and added a splash of vanilla. It was Yummy. 

I have to say that I preferred it with the white sugar. Both ways are delicious, but the white sugar ones were the best banana muffins that I have ever made or eaten, hands down. Thanks for the recipe"
417474,25885,2007-06-17,5,"Mmmm...I don't like banana bread, but I decided to give this recipe a try because I had a bunch of ""baby"" Ecuadorian bananas just waiting to be used up. I am now a huge fan of THIS bread. I followed the recipe exactly but fell a little short on the mashed bananas(I had only two cups worth). Used a tsp. of vanilla as some other reviewers suggested and followed the recipe exactly otherwise. My bread took exactly 60 min. and the aroma coming from my oven alone sold me! Cooled in the pan for the 10 minutes, sliced and served to my drooling hubby with some melted butter...YUM!"
121985,25885,2007-06-18,4,"very good, i really enjoyed this.  Next time i will use a little more brown sugar or sprinkle sugar on top.  Thanks."
505325,25885,2007-06-25,5,"I made this bread into muffins, and cooked them for about 40 minutes... I can see how it would be much better in a loaf pan.  My muffins turned out dry, though still good.  They tasted a bit plain to me; next time I might add pecans or walnuts."
136588,25885,2007-06-28,5,"This is very yummy. Just the right level of sweetness and density. I was a first-time baker who came across this easy-to-follow but much raved-about recipe, and it definitely boosted my confidence. I added 1 tsp of vanilla essence, cinnamon and nutmeg each, as suggested by some reviewers, and it's great. I also added sunflower seeds and they go so well. One last thing I added was 1.5 tbsp of mayonnaise - I read somewhere that it's the secret ingredient to soft moist cake."
520150,25885,2007-07-14,5,"Very good, wonderful recipe.  I made muffins with this recipe to share with friends.  Big hit, everyone loved them.  This one is a keeper - thank you for sharing!"
176671,25885,2007-07-16,5,"Moist and delicious, with just the right amount of sweetness. I'd halved the recipe and used my mini-muffin pan. Perfect little bite-sized muffins that taste fantastic!"
430291,25885,2007-07-22,4,"Great Recipe, First loaf was as per the recipe to a T it was good but I found it was lacking just a hint of something. so the Second loaf I added a bit of Freshly ground Cinnamon and a tiny bit of Nutmeg and this was perfect! excellent bread."
111291,25885,2007-08-05,5,"Reviewed Sept. 2005 - This bread has become a ""regular"" in our home. It is by far one of my favorite recipes - MOIST and full of banana flavor. Thanks for posting what has become a family fave!
Reviewed again in August 2007 - this recipe remains a constant in our house - probably the one I have made the most from this website...it has become so well known at my home that my kids' friend's mothers make comments like ""Oh, yeah, my kids love your banana bread!!"""
361931,25885,2007-08-12,5,"This was the BEST banana bread we have ever had.  My 14 year old went on and on about it, and my 2 year old kept saying ""want more muffi mommy.""  That is the true test!  I did make them into muffins rather than the bread, just for ease of transport for breakfast, etc.  Very good!!!"
185926,25885,2007-08-12,5,"Very banana banana bread.  Like others have said it's like a banana pudding bread.  Very dense.  I did not mash all the bananas finely and some chunks remained, I liked the effect.  I baked mine in a bundt pan for 40 minutes until an inserted toothpick came out barely clean.  The flavor is better overnight.  I added cinnamon and vanilla as suggested and I think it enhanced the flavor and aroma."
287110,25885,2007-08-22,5,just like the one my mum used to make
550834,25885,2007-08-25,4,Not sweet enough for my taste. But excellent texture and it only took the banana muffins I made 20is minutes to bake. Will add more sugar next time.
170972,25885,2007-08-28,5,i've made this a few times now - be careful not to overmix the ingredients so to prevent the 'pudding' effect.
397781,25885,2007-08-29,4,"Good stuff. I added cashews and vanilla. I might add more white sugar next time.
The texture is AWESOME."
578659,25885,2007-09-04,5,"Coming from a person who doesn't always enjoy the flavor of banana, this bread was fantastic! I baked mine for 60 minutes and it came out very moist and delicious. I also added 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips to satisfy my chocolate addiction. Great recipe! :)"
247362,25885,2007-09-08,5,"OK,Ok; I just had to add my two cents worth to the comments. In my books, simple is best with classics like this. I used half w/w and half white flour. The bananas required to make 2 1/3 cups mashed were 6&7 (made two loaves with small bananas) To one loaf, I added 1/2 tsp.cinnamon. Both loaves were well done within 60 min. with a nice dark brown crust. The brown sugar and large measure of bananas made the texture very dense and flavourful. I enjoy the lighter cake like muffins  made with yogurt or sour cream but these loaves are classic. From now on when I see a bag of really ripe bananas for thirty cents, I will grab them and use this recipe.Thanks for sharing."
282252,25885,2007-09-09,5,"This is so easy and delicious.  I followed the advice of others on getting it to cook more evenly by baking it in a bundt pan for 40 minutes and it came out perfectly cooked with a very nice consistency.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla the first time I made it and forgot to the second time.  It's great either way.  I also added about a half cup of chopped walnuts.  This time I only had 4 black bananas which was a little less than 2 1/3 cups I guess, but it didn't taste any worse to me or my husband.  Yum."
452606,25885,2007-09-09,4,My husband loved it.  He thought it was the best banana bread he's ever had.  I thought it was good.
251917,25885,2007-09-10,5,Delicious!
322217,25885,2007-09-11,5,"FINALLY!  Here is a recipe that uses LOTS of leftover ""lunchbox"" bananas, instead of the usual 1 or 2.   

Not being a ""cooked banana"" lover, I am thrilled to have found a recipe that uses all my leftover fruit in one go and tastes divine too.  The whole family raved about this.

I poured the batter into 2 loaf tins so made 2 fairly small loaves which worked well for my kids buttered lunchbox slices.  I only cooked them at 180 degrees C for 45mins which was perfect.

I have to say, toasted with peanut butter is heaven on a plate - YUM!

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe"
572374,25885,2007-09-13,5,Great recipe. I didn't have enough bananas so I added a half cup of banana pudding. The bread was so moist. My kids loved it. I will definitely be making this again.
133434,25885,2007-09-13,4,"Very good recipe.  My bananas weren't as dark as suggested, didn't have time to wait for them, but turned out very nice just the same."
500686,25885,2007-09-15,5,Yum!  I added 1 tsp cinn and sprinkled the top with cinn sugar.  Thank you!
517038,25885,2007-09-20,5,"A ""classic"" banana bread with a good, moist texture. I added a handful of chocolate chips and dried cranberries and it turned out nice."
58836,25885,2007-09-22,5,"Had some bananas I needed to do something with.  Decided on this recipe and I'm glad I did.  It was quick and easy.  I have also made recipe #67256 and it's really really good as well, just a bit more time consuming.  I'm sure I'll make this one again.  Thanks!"
487909,25885,2007-09-23,5,"The best banana bread recipe I have tried thus far!  So moist-YUM-YUM!  Very easy to make, it's idiot proof!"
69927,25885,2007-09-23,5,"I've been making this recipe for a few years and am just getting around to adding my review.  This is outstanding.  I love that the banana flavor is stronger than the baking soda, the opposite of which is a failing in far too many quick breads.  I've made this as a loaf of bread, muffins, and doubled it and baked in a 9x13"" pan, all with great results.  Thanks for this recipe that my family has been enjoying for quite a long time and will continue to enjoy.  (I have a batch baking as I type this)"
597270,25885,2007-09-25,5,Very good banana bread. Great banana flavor and is very moist and delicious.
75950,25885,2007-09-26,5,"I found your recipe fantastic.
but I could not resit making a few changes.

Every thing in your recipe stays the same except pan to bake it in.

Use a 10"" bunt pan
1/2 cup of raisins
1 cup chopped walnuts
15 ounce can of fruit cocktail,    drain well & pour contents onto paper towels and gently pat dry...fold into all other items LAST
1 teaspoon cinnamimon."
331223,25885,2007-09-30,5,"I had some extremely overripe bananas that my husband was ready to throw away.  I told him maybe I could make banana bread instead and found this recipe.  It has a great texture, very moist, and an excellent flavor.  I would definitely make this again!  Based on a few of the other reviewers comments I added about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and I think that this subtle flavor definitely added something to the end product.

Thanks for this great way to rescue those mushy, totally brown bananas!"
490713,25885,2007-10-03,1,"Sorry, the muffins turned out too dense for my liking. Thanks for posting anyway."
385423,25885,2007-10-03,4,My bananas were not really black like I wanted but they still made a great moist bread.  I might add a little bit of cinnamon next time for my husband though.
447165,25885,2007-10-06,5,"Great stuff.  The house smelled so good, we had a couple slices while the loaf was still hot.  I added about a half cup or so of walnuts and used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  Between this and the banana muffins I've learned on this site, I'd better stock up on bananas!"
153122,25885,2007-10-06,5,Not that this recipe needs yet ANOTHER RAVE review; but I just can't resist. For years and years I'd used my grandmother's recipe for banana bread and then came across this one and decided to try it. My family absolutely LOVED IT!! They actually would request that I buy extra bananas in order to make this bread. I also ran into the problem with the cook time when baking in one larger bread pan but have since tried it in smaller bread pans; muffin style; and bundt pan...all of these have turned out fabulous. Another thanks for posting such a fantastic and basic recipe that works well with any additions. One addition that I've made that I've not noticed others posting is to replace 1/2 cup of flour with instant oats. Texture changes slightly but is still very moist and adds a little more nutrition for the family. ;-)
535714,25885,2007-10-08,5,12 servings?  LOL  It was gone in about 25 minutes with five people.  I have a request for it already! Thank you.  It is the best!
224968,25885,2007-10-09,5,Awesome! Added 3/4 c nuts too. Turned out great!!!
491970,25885,2007-10-10,3,"This wasn't bad. I liked it, my 11-month old likes it, but Hubby took one bite and threw his slice out. I think I'll stick with my usual recipe."
221235,25885,2007-10-11,5,"Everyone loved it!!  I added about 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  Also added walnuts and choc. chips which are a must in my house.  I baked it in a bundt pan, which cuts down on time and lets it bake more evenly than a loaf pan.  Lots of banana flavor, extremely moist."
270514,25885,2007-10-11,5,"Amazing!  I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet and I must have made 10 loaves already.  I started out making this exactly as written, but end up changing it just a little every time.  I have changed the butter and brown sugar to 1 cup apple butter with 1tsp cinnamon.  Still turns out great.  I usually bake this at 375 for 50 minutes.  Took a loaf to work and it was gone in 15 minutes.  Thanks!"
616588,25885,2007-10-15,5,"Simple, moist, and delicious.  All the qualities one looks for in baking banana bread."
82616,25885,2007-10-23,5,Well I know you really don't need my review :) but I will add it anyways because if we handed out 10 stars this is IT!!!! Oh my goodness this is the BEST banana bread I have EVER made or eaten by a long shot ! I never changed anything followed it to a T............ my SIL whom I really made it for is beyond fussy but he gave it both thumbs UP!! If you need a GOOD banana bread recipe than use this one :)
251686,25885,2007-10-24,5,DH said this wasn't good it was outstanding.  He was afraid it would be too sweet and it wasn't.  Just moist and delicious.  Thanks for the great banana bread.  Gloria
556387,25885,2007-10-27,4,"This was really good and delicious. I made these into muffins and the family ate them up the very same day! :) I substituted 1 cup of whole-wheat flour but it made very good bread all the same. :)

I loved the moist almost chewiness to the muffin."
100183,25885,2007-11-02,4,"This is very good banana bread. I used 100% whole wheat flour, and it still came out moist and flavorful. Thankyou."
91326,25885,2007-11-04,5,"Yum, yum, yum!  Moist, caramelized on the outside, strong banana flavor - next time I might add a little more sugar.  

I got 15 regular muffins and 12 mini-muffins from this recipe."
616211,25885,2007-11-05,5,"THE. BEST. EVER. 
I added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and a dash of nutmeg, as suggested. It also needed 70 minutes to bake. I also left some larger banana chunks when mashing.  I sprinkled the top of the bread with clear ""sprinkles"" to give it a nice shine.  This was GONE at the firehouse in 3 minutes flat!"
383802,25885,2007-11-07,5,"Yum!  This is the first banana bread I ever made!  Its fantastic!  Inside, the bread has the texture of a steamed pudding!"
403749,25885,2007-11-07,5,This is the best banana bread I've made so far.  I usually use 4-5 bananas and the taste is incredible.  Very moist and tasty!
43642,25885,2007-11-10,5,"I have several banana bread recipes that I love, but I wanted to try something new.  I am glad I did!  This is such a simple recipe but it bakes up into a flavorful and moist (but not sticky) loaf.  I subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for part of the all-purpose.  I made 3 mini loaves that baked perfectly in about 40 minutes.  Wonderful!  Thank you!"
643989,25885,2007-11-10,5,"My kids loved this recipe.  Very, very good!"
618068,25885,2007-11-11,5,Very good. My 4 and 6 year old really enjoyed this also. Thanks.
580030,25885,2007-11-13,5,"Yum! I loved this recipe.  You were right about the bananas - the blacker the better! I put mine in a paper bag for a couple days, they added so much flavor and moisture.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks!"
65510,25885,2007-11-14,5,"Great banana bread recipe!  I used 3 medium large bananas rather than measuring them. I added 1/2 t cinnamon, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 bag of ghiradelli chocolate chips.  It was a VERY heavy loaf, but very delicious !"
166371,25885,2007-11-15,5,My new favorite banana bread recipe!  I used 5 medium to large bananas and baked for right around 60 minutes.  The bananas were very ripe and they sweetened the bread wonderfully without adding a lot of extra sugar.  Thank you so much!!
205730,25885,2007-11-15,5,"This bread is very moist and good, but do your best to wait til its a day old to eat it!  I was unsure how much I liked this recipe the first day because it didn't seem sweet or flavorful enough at first.  But the flavors really developed overnight and now its delicious!  I used 5 completely black bananas that were falling out of their skin and it yielded a very moist, even bread."
628779,25885,2007-11-18,5,"I know you dont need anymore stars, but, this was awsome. My husband and I ate half of it already and its only been out of the oven an hour."
218936,25885,2007-11-19,5,"Absolutely awesome!! I adore banana bread and am always trying different ones, no more though! This one is a keeper for sure. The kids devoured it and can't wait for the bananas to be ready to make more!"
194532,25885,2007-11-21,5,Best banana bread I've had.  My family loves it.  I usually make two smaller loaves & use 5 BLACK bananas.  I also like to add chopped walnuts to mine for banana nut bread.
75254,25885,2007-11-22,5,Amazing! cooked 40 min in a bunt pan and was perfect. This was gone at my house in less than 1 hr.
636124,25885,2007-11-27,5,Great banana bread recipe! I love this one because I'm allergic to nuts (in most banana breads) and not so crazy about the variations with chocolate chips... this bread has a GREAT banana flavor and is SO easy! I've made it several times already and it's been a hit with everyone I've shared it with.  Thanks for a great recipe I will be using a lot in the future!! :)
284106,25885,2007-11-28,5,"I would give it 10 stars if I could!  This is absolutely the best banana bread ever!  Moist, just the perfect sweetness, not overpowering, and a rich banana flavor.  Perfection!  Hey, it takes an Ana to know a Banana Banana Bread"
81611,25885,2007-12-01,3,"Good, but bland compared to what I'm used to. I liked the moistness; had a different quality of moistness compared to oil/applesauce recipes, which I'm sure is from the larger amount of bananas. This will be a good recipe to tinker with next time I end up with a huge bunch of overripe bananas (which is rare). I used 6 to get the 2 1/3 cups."
528279,25885,2007-12-04,5,"This was hands-down the best banana bread I have ever made/eaten!  Like the last reviewer, I also needed 6 ripe bananas (I would not even attempt this recipe with less than 6 bananas on-hand).  My bread also looked ""done"" on the outside after about 45 minutes, but I could tell the inside was not baked through... I left the bread in for the full hour, and much to my surprise, the outside was not burnt!  It was absolutely perfect!  Thank you for posting this recipe!"
628553,25885,2007-12-13,5,"Loved it! Will definitely add this to my regular rotation.  Easy, and sooo good for breakfast!"
117221,25885,2007-12-14,5,Oh yeah!  This is awesome.  I baked mine in four mini loaf pans and it turned out nice.  Probably could have baked it about 45-50 minutes though.  Thanks for a great recipe!
295863,25885,2007-12-16,5,Really good and moist! I made muffins with this recipe too.
414923,25885,2007-12-16,5,"This was excellent.  It took me five bananas to make 2 1/3 C, so I'll have to plan ahead to make sure their are enough over ripe bananas to make this again.  

I made the recipe according to directions, adding a little vanilla and some nutmeg.  

Next time, I want to try whole wheat flour, at least half, and I'd bake it another 10 minutes or so.  At 65 minutes, the final result was wonderful, but I think it could have been just a bit more done without drying out.

Excellent, thank you!"
129652,25885,2007-12-17,2,The large amount of bananas makes the bread appear to be undercooked because of all the mushy parts.  I made a few loaves and gave them to friends as Christmas presents.  No one commented on the bread.
342234,25885,2007-12-18,5,"Awesome! The flavor can't be beat.  I've made this twice; the first time was in a loaf and I slightly under-baked it.  It was fine, though the texture a little soft.  This morning I made muffins with the recipe and was careful to make sure my test toothpick was clean before removing from the oven.  Very good!"
683503,25885,2007-12-25,5,"Baked this and it was very moist.
Will certainly keep this recipe on hand."
610287,25885,2007-12-27,5,Always delicious! I am not a good baker but I have yet to screw up this recipe! That's something I am proud of. I actually melted reeses chips in a saucepan and glazed it over the banana bread after it had cooled. Either way it's delicious!
699241,25885,2008-02-25,5,"So simple to make and yet wonderful!  I only had 1 egg and it STILL came out great!  Thanks for the great recipe, this one is a keeper!"
669653,25885,2007-12-27,5,yummy yummy i made 2 loafs last night and added an extra 1/2 cup of bananas so the bread  was very bananay and wonderful i ate 1/3 of a loaf by myslef yummmyyyyy
388414,25885,2007-12-28,5,5 stars- need I say more??
185684,25885,2007-12-28,4,Very good. Really moist with a great banana flavor. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla just because most banana breads I have made calls for it. It's a keeper.
435211,25885,2007-12-29,5,great with choc chips & coconut
707955,25885,2007-12-31,5,I made this bread for work tonight and I must say it is outstanding!  It is not too sweet and very moist.  My co-workers loved it!  And the best part is that is was very simple to make.
714383,25885,2008-01-03,4,yummy
589729,25885,2008-01-04,5,"Not like you need it with all the great reviews, but here is another one. Very tasty bread. Very bananaee. I did use Whole Wheat White flour, so I got a little wheaty taste, but it taste, and I think is, a little healthier. I also added a 1/4 cup of ground flax meal. Thanks for the great recipe."
371738,25885,2008-01-05,5,This is thee recipe I use for banana nut mini muffins.  My husband's favorite!
516297,25885,2008-01-05,2,I'm going to have to try this again ... I was so disappointed! This didn't taste special to me - I thought it was a heavy and fairly bland bread. Will try again (and adjust my rating if I have better luck next time!).
650938,25885,2008-01-05,5,not that this even needs another rating but WOW!  so quick and easy and delicious.  Thank you!
456116,25885,2008-01-05,5,"Great, I made it just like the recipe called for.  I used 4 mini loaf pans, and in two added some mini choc. chips for variety.
Very moist, and wonderful tasting.  Plan on making more this weekend.  Thanks Shelley for the great recipe!"
242007,25885,2008-01-06,5,Delicious!  I've already made this several times.  My DH's favorite banana bread.  Takes about 7 bananas and has tons of flavor.  Thank you for a great recipe.
117781,25885,2008-01-07,3,"This is a really dense banana bread, I really like a softer, fluffier banana bread. It was moist for sure, but I really expected it to have more flavor. My family thought the recipe was okay, but no raves unfortunately."
507422,25885,2008-01-11,5,"We just took some muffins from this recipe out of the oven and it's definitely big on flavor.  I didn't read any reviews so the denseness was a little unexpected, but these won't go to waste.  I had enough bananas on hand to double the recipe so there are still six mini-loaves baking.  I did add a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cardamom like I do to the recipe I normally use.  Very yummy.  I will have to try it with whole wheat flour next time."
382203,25885,2008-01-12,4,"This is a very tasty and easy recipe to make, moist with lots of banana flavor. thanks for sharing"
459034,25885,2008-01-14,5,This is my new favorite banana bread recipe.  Great banana taste!  I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips to one bread and chopped pecans to the other.  YUM
199953,25885,2008-01-18,5,Great banana taste!
493002,25885,2008-01-19,5,"This was wonderful!!! I made 3 of the smaller loaves with this recipe & it took about 45 mins to cook to perfection. I made 1 just a s the recipe said the added chocolate chips to another, & sprinkled layers of cinnamon sugar in the 3rd one. The were all fabulous!!! I love how simple this recipe is. Definately a keeper. Thank you for posting this yummy recipe.
note to self: I tried this again but made just one 9x5 loaf, even after adding an extra 25 mins the loaf was still a bit ""wet"". I prefered the smaller loaves. The smaller loaves also weren't as heavy."
277825,25885,2008-01-19,5,"This was easy and great, we did it in muffins and will be making this from now on.  Tks Shel!!"
585739,25885,2008-01-20,5,"MMMMMM MMMMMM GOOD!!! Loved this recipe! I made it exactly as stated, although I didn't measure the banana's just used 3 medium ones. Turned out great! The kids kept asking for MORE MORE! Will use this recipe again, and again!"
737445,25885,2008-01-22,1,Sorry!  I tried this after reading all the rave reviews.  I followed it to the letter & it came out looking just like the photo - but it was VERY DRY.  Yuck.  I won't make this again.
682603,25885,2008-01-24,5,"Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe Shelley! Rave reviews all around, and you are right- very flavourful!"
69260,25885,2008-01-25,2,I guess I like my banana bread with spices or something. This just seemed plain to me and not overly special.
741252,25885,2008-01-26,2,"The bread baked up really big and beautiful looking. However, as other readers have commented, the outside cooked too much while the inside remained gooey. Because of the brown sugar, there is a nice caramely texture to the crust, however the bread could be a bit sweeter.I might try it again, but I would add a bit more sugar and bake it in a bundt pan, or as muffins."
359553,25885,2008-01-27,5,Delicious!  Very flavorful even without the addition of extra spices.  True banana bread flavor.  The whole family really enjoyed this bread.  I will be making this again.
581722,25885,2008-01-27,4,I made this recipe in muffin tins and they were great!  Thanks for the recipe.
48692,25885,2008-01-28,5,Excellent banana bread with a really fine texture and moistness. Great! Might add a 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a 1/2 tsp cinnamon next time but otherwise perfect.
197513,25885,2008-04-26,4,"Tasty recipe, but more cake than bread than I would have liked. But moist and tasty none-the-less. Thanks for the recipe"
604324,25885,2008-01-30,5,"This was better than my mom's banana bread! I do admit, I added some nutmeg and cinnamon. I love how this bread is so moist! I also added some blueberries. Next time I make it I might throw in some chocolate chips."
316396,25885,2008-02-01,4,"very yummy. didn't have enough black bananas so i made up the diff. with apple sauce, turned out great!!"
750295,25885,2008-02-03,5,"This is the only recipe I will ever use it uses about 6 bananas about twice the amount of most recipes. It yeilds a very moist and flavorful bread. I usually add a cup of chopped walnuts to mine, but that is totally optional."
689557,25885,2008-02-03,4,"Yum! So moist & delicous! I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg & cinnamon and also some semi-sweet choclate chips! I baked it in a bundt pan and it was ready after only 45 minutes!  This bread dissapeared so fast,it was a real hit.  I just wish I used blacker bananas, mine weren't overly ripe, and the banana flavor was very subtle.  Thanks, definately a keeper!!!!"
751589,25885,2008-02-03,5,"I HATE cooking, and I definitely don't bake, but I made this recipe and I have made many, many loaves since the first time.  It is a delicious, fairly easy and quick recipe.  My only change based on user comments was to add a foil tent while cooking for the first 50 minutes and to extend the total cooking time about 10 minutes.  I have not tasted a better banana bread.  This is really the best."
48305,25885,2008-02-04,5,The best!
371746,25885,2008-02-06,5,"So good, I'm only going to share with one neighbor, I won't tell the rest of them about it until I make it again.  I'm keeping it in the fridge so that we can eat every last crumb.  We're at 5,000 feet, so I did bake it for 80 minutes, and used 6 bananas.  Thanks So MUCH!"
753606,25885,2008-02-06,2,"I love banana bread and am in search of a really good recipe.  After reading all the great reviews, I tried this one.  I don't know what happened but my banana bread came out very dense and a bit bland.  I am trying a new recipe today."
607393,25885,2008-02-06,5,"Such an easily-adjustabe-to-one's-own-taste recipe deserves 5 stars. We used Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten-free baking flour (which tends to produce a dryer version of the gluten-filled origonal), added some spices (cinnamon and nutmeg), and not-overly-ripe-enough bananas and it was still a hit. Buy stock in bananas- I'm going to be emptying the shelves of them as I continue to explore the wonderful things you can do with this recipe. Thanks SO much for making my baking-day!"
694564,25885,2008-02-07,5,it was great!!! honestly i thought i hated it at first cuz i ate it too soon..upon sitting for a couple hours the bananas set and it became unbelivable tasty!!!!! the ONLY recipe ill be using from now on...i added 2 capfuls of vanilla extract and some cinnamon..used 5 ripe bananas...had to bake for 60 minutes then an additional 20 covered with foil as it was browning a little too much...PERFECT!!!!
136840,25885,2008-02-09,1,"Don't know where I went wrong, but this is the driest, most tasteless banana bread I've ever had!  Followed recipe exactly, cooked it less that the time specified because it was dry using the ""toothpick"" test.  Maybe if I put lots of butter on it I'd be able to eat it, but am planning on throwing it out."
741750,25885,2008-02-10,4,"I only used 4 bananas this time... didn't actually measure, but will use more next time.... and/or adding the vanilla that someone else mentioned.  I just had my second piece.... yummmmmm!!"
600761,25885,2008-02-10,5,"This was delicious. Extremely moist, very banana-y (and I only used 4 ripe bananas). I followed the suggestions of previous posters: 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, 1 tsp of vanilla and a healthy dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, I followed the suggestion of using a Bundt pan rather than a loaf pan and it worked perfectly! I baked it for 45 minutes and was very pleased with the result. My picky 10-year-old gave it the thumbs up! Will definitely make again!
Addendum 2/10/08 ~~ this bread can also be made with 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp canola oil in place of the butter and it is still very yummy, just lower in fat!"
638264,25885,2008-02-11,5,"Very good!

I doubled the recipe so I could make one loaf plus mini muffins for my toddler (she loves her 'baby muffies').  I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat and couldn't tell any difference.  I also didn't have quite enough bananas so I ended up putting a cup of applesauce in it.   I topped the loaf with pecans before baking."
166084,25885,2008-02-13,5,"Very good banana bread...family loved it! It was very moist and sliced nicely.  Even better after being refrigerated overnight.  Of course, there was only half a loaf to put in there, because they ate the other half when it came out of the oven!  Thanks, Shelley!"
366193,25885,2008-02-13,5,"yummy yummy!  I sneak some ground flax in too, about half cup and a little more banana."
765453,25885,2008-02-15,0,cannot print recipe
59801,25885,2008-02-15,2,If I were rating this recipe on taste alone it would get 5 stars for sure but it just isn't a bread recipe.  The ratios don't make a bread...just too much moisture.  I think burning the outside to get the inside done is a dead give away.  Maybe with a few alterations this one could be amazing though.
314327,25885,2008-02-17,5,Very moist with a great banana flavor. I added walnuts.
101418,25885,2008-02-19,0,"Wow! This really is fantastic bread! Very moist (I used about 5 large overly ripe bananas), and it just gets better every day! I can't stay away from it. I added a couple of handfuls of walnuts...scrumdillyicious!"
426903,25885,2008-02-20,5,"I was craving banana bread, and didn't want to wait. So the bananas I used weren't as black as they should have been, but the bread still turned out great. Thanks for posting."
611201,25885,2008-02-24,5,"I made mine into cupcakes and then iced them with some left over creamcheese icing i already had in the fridge, they were magnificant, we to took them to a playgroup for snack and they kids gobbled them up. and the ones we kept home stayed moist forever"
226989,25885,2008-02-26,5,"I am pretty sure I've alreaedy reviewed this, but since it doesn't show me my review anymore I'll just have to write a new one. I have made this bread many times and its always a winner. I have made it just as it, but I have also substituted the following combination. Banana-zuchinni and banana-pumpkin. From times when I didn't have enough banana and they always tasted great. I do add chcolate chips, and have also topped it with poppy seeds and brown sugar. I have added oatmeal and flaxseed. Great bread!!"
371590,25885,2008-02-26,5,"I don't think this recipe needs yet another review, but I felt inclined to express my love of this recipe! It couldn't be easier, aside from the fact that it's the first time I've EVER tasted a banana bread I could describe as DECADENT. Bravo!"
340157,25885,2008-02-29,5,"Everyone loved this bread.  I now have found the best recipe out there, and I'm sticking to it!"
174991,25885,2008-03-10,4,Nice moist muffins.  I added cinnamon. nutmeg and vanilla.
466212,25885,2008-03-12,5,"Moist, perfectly sweet, and just plain mmmm mmmm good.

If you want to make muffins they are cooked at 350 for about 35 minutes."
716192,25885,2008-03-13,5,"A perfect recipe for banana bread.  My family is not crazy about nuts, this was great.  Will make again soon."
277472,25885,2008-03-25,4,"This was ok, a simple plain banana bread.      I would have liked it to be moister and richer."
429262,25885,2008-03-27,3,"this was a little bland and dry for me...I'm not sure if I overcooked it.  Since it has so many great reviews, I'll assume it was soomething I did."
91698,25885,2008-03-30,4,"This was a simple, yet delicious recipe."
388044,25885,2008-03-30,5,Perfect!
707675,25885,2008-04-03,5,"This is a simple banana bread recipe that leaves out any extra ingredients that tend to mask the pure banana flavor.  I never make banana bread without nuts, but I refrained this time, and I'm glad I did.  This simplified version is made even more decadent by the brown sugar, which adds just a bit of crisp butteriness on the crust.  I would bake for about 55 minutes next time, but this could just be my oven.  I like banana bread warmed with a smidge of crunchy peanut butter sloughed on."
625680,25885,2008-04-07,5,"WONDEFUL!! This bread is so good, moist, easy and fast to make! I baked in a silicone loaf pan and the results were beautiful! Cooking time was a whole 20 minutes longer than it says on the recipe. I agree with another reviewer about some people not cooking it through, the gooey center will firm up if you cook it longer and even though the bread looks a scary dark brown it will NOT be burnt. My Family was impressed! The bread sliced so nicely. We ate it warm right out of the oven and some chose to add butter. It slices even nicer after cooling but they just couldn't wait to try it out. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I will be using it again and again, now our bananas don't need to go to waste! -----UPDATE----- I made this for the third time yesterday and decided to pour into muffin cups. It took only 30 minutes to bake and they turned out perfect! Batter is enough to fill 12 reg size muffin cups to the top, it doesn't raise too much so you'll have a nice small muffin top."
727685,25885,2008-04-10,5,"Awesome!! Decided to make the muffin version (like Vilmaris) but the batter doesn't change. Got like 16 muffins out of it. Simple to make and you get the best banana taste ever! I would leave it as is, but my family has a sweet tooth and they suggested about 1/4 cup more of brown sugar. But for me, the color, texture, taste; everything deserves a 2 thumbs up. Thanks for sharing."
465911,25885,2008-04-13,4,"I really liked this banana bread, but it is not my favorite banana bread. I was hoping to replace my old recipe, but it just didn't do it."
667915,25885,2008-04-14,5,I have made many different banana breads and I have to say this is one of my favorites!  One of the great things about it other than the texture and flavor is the fact that there are so few ingredients...things that are always on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!
493362,25885,2008-04-16,5,"I made this 2x before and its ALWAYS a hit.  When I was at the grocery store today they had a huge bag of ""ripe"" bananas for $.99- Needless to say I will be baking this recipe with them!"
320775,25885,2008-04-17,5,"Easy, few ingredients, and it tastes better than anything I've ever gotten in a bakery. Thanks for such a great recipe. :)"
382007,25885,2008-04-19,4,"Very moist and delicious. I split it into two 9 x 5 cakes - and I'm glad I did, because each took 60 minutes to bake through. I took note of other comments and covered the cake with foil half way through. I ended up using 9 small bananas (!), and I left some small chunks in the mash, which was a good idea because it ended up being very tasty. A good way to use up leftover bananas fast."
312081,25885,2008-04-19,5,"Sooooo good! I made sure to sift the flour, soda, and salt so that it was extra airy and these were to die for! Not too sweet and super moist! I made them into muffins and baked for 30 min. Will definitely use this recipe again! Oh, and FYI - I didn't mash my bananas before hand, I just broke them into chunks and blended them in with the eggs - why get another bowl dirty! Perfect!"
798036,25885,2008-04-21,5,"Makes Great Muffins!
I used a Texas sized muffin pan (makes 6 muffins) and baked for 32 minutes. I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, next time I will add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I only used 1/2 stick of butter and the muffins were moist and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe."
721674,25885,2008-04-25,5,"I now have a new recipe. This one will replace my old one. Next time the only difference I will do is add nuts. I used 5 good sized ripe bananas,that had been frozen. I made 3 mini loaves(small alluminum pans) and cooked for 50 mins. I  put the loaves on a cookie sheet for baking. They came out of the pans with super-ease. I did not grease the pans. Would be a wonderful gift! Those mini loaves are cute! Thanks for posting."
578085,25885,2008-04-29,5,"Yum! Very banana-y, not too sweet. I definately would add a tsp of cinnamon and some other spices that complement that (ginger, cloves, allspice), but don't go over board, because the bananas themselves are great. I made medium sized muffins and baked them for 35 min. They come out of the oven verrrryyy gooey inside, but firm up after they cool, so don't worry too much. Thanks for the recipe :)"
264452,25885,2008-04-29,5,"Excellent! I couldn't find my loaf pan so I baked it in a 13 x9 cake pan for about 25-30 minutes, kinda made a ""snack cake/bread""
Very GOOD!!!!!!!!! Thanks"
551551,25885,2008-05-01,5,"The absolute best I have ever had!!!  Thank You!!! I did have to bake it 20 minutes longer but it came out beautifully golden brown and just as moist as can be. This is a winner, a keeper and a regular treat!!"
723989,25885,2008-05-02,5,"I had many bananas that were too ripe to eat, so I looked for a banana bread recipe which would use more than the usual two or three bananas. I prepared the recipe exactly as directed and it came out perfect! My family loved it! This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for posting."
326787,25885,2008-05-03,0,"I wasn't sure about a banana bread that didn't have nuts, but this is really great without. Sweet enough to be a cake. I made for A TASTE OF YELLOW...LIVESTRONG cancer awarness. Very, very good."
833710,25885,2008-05-06,3,"This is a very ""bread-like"" recipe, rather than the cake-like banana bread recipes you usually see.  I thought it was a bit bland, but to be fair, I didn't have quite as much banana as the recipe called for.  It's good if you don't want a very sweet treat."
470815,25885,2008-05-10,5,"Off the hook banana bread.  Fantastic, Awesome, ....
Great thanks so much.  The only change I made was to use Vanilla pudding, but otherwise WOWOWOWOWOWOW."
518502,25885,2008-05-10,5,"I have made this Banana Bread 5 times and each time make it just a little different, but it is great the way that it is. I will substitute a little applesauce if I don't have enough bananas. Chocolate Chips make it great too!!"
291000,25885,2008-05-11,5,"I love this recipe as my back to basics Banana Bread recipe. Simple, straightforward and sparse. Much like a canvas ready for paint this recipe can be added to and ""citified"" or it can remain as classic home cooking  ready to eat as is. I add to it sometimes ( I have added dried fruits, nuts, a bit of vanilla or other spices such as ginger) and still I come back back to it and cook it as is (like tonight) when I want to strip it back to basics and build on it again."
374498,25885,2008-05-12,4,This bread does bake for a long time!  I am glad I read the reviews on that.  Very good banana bread.
503916,25885,2008-05-18,5,moist and delicious! i baked the bread in a 9 x 13 baking dish. took 30 minutes. added a tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg like other reviewers suggested. only used 2 cups of mashed bananas (4 enormous bananas were all i had). thank you for a lovely recipe!
719083,25885,2008-05-19,5,I made this a while back for a change instead of the regular banana bread we make. I did this because this one had reviews that showed it used more bananas which I wanted to get rid of some of our rotten bananas. I set out 6 bananas to defrost (we freeze them in tinfoil if we don't get to making banana bread). When I made it these bananas only provided two cups so I took a slightly browned one from our counter and added it but that didn't make 1/3 of a cup so I just went ahead and made the bread. I split the mixture into two pans and sprinkled a lot of brown sugar over them. My got done a little under sixty minutes and turned out great! Thanks!
50151,25885,2008-06-02,5,Made this today with my daughter.  It was very easy and very tasty....couldn't ask for more!!  Thanks!
557764,25885,2008-06-02,5,Yum!
686060,25885,2008-06-09,5,"Great recipe!  This was very easy to make, I added half cup of chocolate chips.  I will make this again."
96094,25885,2008-06-10,5,"Even though I've used this recipe over and over, I keep on forgetting to rate it. Would give it more stars if possible. This gets made whenever the store has over ripe bananas. Yummy!!"
143917,25885,2008-06-18,5,This is great banana bread. DH is thrilled I finally found a recipe he loves! Thanks Shelley for a keeper.
355282,25885,2008-06-20,0,"Yyyyyyuuuummmmmmm!
Great recipe! I have been experimenting with banana bread for years...this is like pudding on the inside and nice and crusty on the outside!

Thanks!"
352845,25885,2008-06-23,5,"Another 5 star rating? This actually calls for at least 10 stars.  It was outstanding.  The only thing I did different was add a cup of chopped pecans.  For this, I will let my bananas turn black on purpose.  Thank you so much!!"
562034,25885,2008-06-24,5,"This Banana Bread is banging!!! Everyone in my house loved it!!! 
And it's soooo easy! Thank You!"
724525,25885,2008-06-25,0,"Wow!  My son and I loved this bread,we ate the whole loaf!! I made it exactly as the recipe stated.Thank you very much for the recipe."
329017,25885,2008-06-27,5,awesome bread!  i used more banana's than the recipe called for because i just wanted to use them up and it still turned out great.  it has a very rich flavor and the brown sugar definitely adds to the overall taste of the bread.
655996,25885,2008-06-28,5,This was so good! I used a tad bit less banana because that's all I had left and it still turned out spectacular! Just what banana bread should taste like.
338323,25885,2008-07-08,5,"absolutely excellent!!  the only addition i made was to add chopped dates.  if you check the doneness with a knife instead of a toothpick, you can tell if the inside is still gooey."
59473,25885,2008-07-08,5,Great Banana Bread recipe. I added a tsp. vanilla to it. I only had 4 bananas so like another reviewer I added a little sour cream. Will be making this often. Thanks
487511,25885,2008-07-12,5,"Fantabulous!!!! I hate to admit it, but 4 of us nearly wiped the thing out in one sitting!! My 3 year old son kept looking into the oven and giving updates as to how high it was getting! Wonderful crust and flavor. And it couldn't be easier! Thanx for a keeper!"
886144,25885,2008-07-16,5,"yum! baked it in 2 smaller loaf pans just for 40 minutes. Used 21/2 cups of mashed bananas as that's all I have, it was still great. Mwah!"
403722,25885,2008-07-20,5,YUM!  Will use this one again!
821269,25885,2008-07-21,5,"Great recipe. Made for Sunday dinner as I had six or seven frozen bananas in the freezer and
wanted to add a special touch to dinner. Easy and quick to throw together. Substituted chocolate chips in place of nuts and made muffins instead of loaf. The G-kids ate them up and  SNL took remaining few for his lunch on Monday. Made 15 muffins in standard size muffin tin. Will definitely make as the overripe bananas add up in the freezer."
248647,25885,2008-07-22,0,"Delicious. I made these with some bananas in the freezer and since my friend and I are trying to watch the ""bad carbs"" I used whole wheat flour"" and out them in reg muffin tins and the extra in mini muffin tins and split between both of our families.  Our kiddos all love them and all the while they are a little bit healthier too :) Thanks Shelley for a yummy recipe!"
668969,25885,2008-07-23,5,"Great recipe.  I am not a baker at all but the smell of ripening bananas prompted me to look up this recipe.  Glad I did.  They were very yummy, flavorful, and more cake-like than bread-like.  As I'm not a baker I didn't have any original variations, but stole some from other reviewers.  I added 1tsp of Vanilla and a sprinkling of cinammon. I used 8 small bananas to make 2 1/3 cp. No nuts.  I did make them in the mini-cupcake pans and it only took about 30 minutes for them to bake to perfection.  I will NEVER throw out over-ripe bananas again."
249519,25885,2008-07-25,0,"Great recipe! No stars, because I altered it so much, and, besides, it doesn't need any more 5 star ratings.

My modifications were in the name of health... After experimenting, I now use all whole wheat flour, replace the butter with applesauce, use only 1/2 cup of the brown sugar (dark), and add 1 t. cinnamon. I usually bake it in 3 small loaf pans, and it takes approx. 1 hour before the toothpick comes out clean.  I usually I add walnuts, occasionally also  dates or chocolate chips.

I love it best almost right out of the oven. The top crust is carmelized, and it is sooo delicious, so moist and tasty! Like other reviewers have noted, almost like a pudding. 

I never even liked banana bread before, but was drawn to this one by all the reviews, and I am sure glad I tried it!  Definetely 5+ stars!And it is so good that no apologies are needed for using the more healthful subs!"
905016,25885,2008-07-28,3,I really like banana bread and I have baked 3 different recipes. This was better than one of the others...I added butter and honey. The recipe was very simple and easy to follow. The best Banana bread recipe I found was on Williams-Somona site.
575536,25885,2008-07-30,5,"this is the recipe i have been looking for.. i did what someone suggested and replaced the butter with apple sauce. i also added 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4.. next time i will use even less. i also used some ground flax for goodness sake.

i have never tasted anything finer (it may of helped i put choco chips in it tee hee)"
283834,25885,2008-08-02,5,"Wow, can banana bread have toooooo much banana flavor? This one might come close, but it was wonderful! This is now my new banana bread recipe and I will only be making this one from now on!"
157102,25885,2008-08-07,5,"Used half whole wheat flour and only 1/2 cup sugar, and subbed in some grated Fuji apple for a bit of the banana. Also, I melted the butter instead of softening it (too impatient to wait for it to soften, lol). Anyway, this is superb. Delicious and moist, this will make my banana-loving brothers very happy. I'll make this again."
474993,25885,2008-08-09,5,"Perhaps one of the best banana quick bread recipes that ever existed:D I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of butter (because I used up the rest for cookies), and increased the bananas to 2 1/2 cups. These taste really delicious fresh out of the oven, when they're still piping hot:D Thanks!"
160666,25885,2008-08-09,5,"Wow! My banana tree had lots of bananas that needed to be used, so I made a double batch (1 loaf and 6 muffins) Added a tsp of vanilla. I just tried the muffins (they only took 30 mins.) and I've never tasted better banana bread! My son that doesn't like banana bread, asked for more! Delicious!"
914534,25885,2008-08-10,5,"This banana bread is very moist and good hot out of the oven. If you like a more dense bread, this is the one to make.  I think I would add a bit of vanilla flavor and possibly some nuts next time.  Good stuff!"
64539,25885,2008-08-10,5,"It was great, especially when I threw in a handfull of carob chips!"
360030,25885,2008-08-11,5,"I personally despise banana's, but my husband gave this rave reviews.  He really liked how moist it is and told me to make this recipe again."
513039,25885,2008-08-17,4,"I am giving this 4 stars because we were not thrilled with it, but not sure if that may be because we did not measure our bananas. We did use 5 ripe bananas though. They were black spotted not totally black. We made these into 12 muffins and baked 26 minutes.  I love the texture. We mixed it in a food processor to do it quickly and with less mess. I think the muffins were great except not enough flavor. I was surprised by that, but then I usually add alot of bananas to my banana bread no matter what the recipe. I will try this again but with more bananas and maybe some spices. Lovely muffins that I think have potential. Thanks for the recipe."
177638,25885,2008-08-25,5,Loved it!  Added some nutmet and cinnamon and had to bake it longer than the recipe calls for.  It is great thought.  Saves wonderfully in the freezer.  Taking a piece out as wanted!
855935,25885,2008-08-27,5,I am sad that I only brought one piece to work with me today.  I subbed 1/4 c cocoa for 1/4 c of the flour and added about 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp vanilla.  The smell was tantalizing as it baked and the bread turned out wonderfully.  I am already dreaming up other variations!  Thanks for a great recipe!
437727,25885,2008-08-27,0,"Oh, my! Fantastic recipe! I changed slightly (based on cooking once according to written directions... subbed half whole wheat flour and added 1/4 c to total........... also added fresh ground nutmeg and cinnamon and added 1t good vanilla............dry ingredients w. dry, vanilla w/ egg mix... smelled FANTASTIC cooking, hope to get rave reviews from coworkers tomorrow..............THANKS SO MUCH!!!"
169140,25885,2008-08-28,5,This made wonderful mini muffins for my 4yo he loved them!
186070,25885,2008-08-28,5,"Very good banana bread, made almost as written except I added 2 tsp. of vanilla and did not bother mashing the banana just threw them in as the mixer was whirling and it mushed them up just fine.  Thanks for this great little recipe, one of my sons and husband loved it."
725134,25885,2008-08-29,5,"I have been searching for a new banana bread recipe and I figured how could 484 reviewers who love this be wrong?  They're not!  This is fantastic banana bread - I substituted applesauce for the butter and egg beaters for the eggs to lighten it up. (Others may have done the same thing, but I didn't have time to read through the other reviews.) It turned out so yummy and it will be made often at my house!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
92816,25885,2008-09-01,5,A perfect Banana Bread.I did as one reviewer suggested and used a Bundt Pan so I didn't have to deal with the soggy middle banana bread like I do in a loaf pan.I will do that from now on.It took just 35 minutes to bake in a bundt pan in a convection oven.I also added a tsp of vanilla.
171187,25885,2008-09-02,5,"Like another reviewer, I tried this recipe since there were so many amazing reviews.  And it truly lived up to its reputation!

It turned out SO moist!  And a true banana flavor!  I also added the teaspoon of vanilla, and it took 60 minutes in the oven.

Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!"
573090,25885,2008-09-03,4,"i too made this in a bundt pan and it took 35 mins,, great flavor and i drizzled chocolate frosting over it and made it just that much better... thanks"
950539,25885,2008-09-09,2,"The flavor is good. My family agreed on that, we also agreed that the density and texture was way to overwhelming for us. Everytime I checked the bread for doneness with a breadknife, it came out gooey even up to cooking after 2 hours. I guess that's just the way it is meant to be. I will say though that this bread will never burn."
936998,25885,2008-09-11,5,My husband and toddler daughter loved this. I used 4 large very ripe bananas. I also added in 1 tsp. vanilla and some cinnamon. (I think around 2 tsp.) Thanks for the recipe.
568159,25885,2008-09-21,5,"You have made me into a banana bread cooking freak! I make this recipe at least every other week, my family really loves it. I usually cut the recipe in half and bake on the second shelf from the top for about twenty minutes. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!"
920845,25885,2008-09-21,5,Really good! I use four overripe bananas. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I bake them as muffins for 28 minutes.
797028,25885,2008-09-24,5,Exceptional. I made as muffins. Baked 30 minutes. Added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla. They turned out very moist and lightly brown. A definite keeper. Thanks Shelley.
160981,25885,2008-09-28,5,WOW! Seriously good bread. Very moist and melt in your mouth good. I followed directions exactly. Next time will try to add nutmeg/vanilla. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!
355571,25885,2008-09-28,5,"Really good - perfectly moist. Added 1tsp vanilla extract, dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, 1/4 cup of ground pecans and 1/2 oz of whiskey. :-) Totally sinful treat when toasted and spread with Nutella!"
151271,25885,2008-09-30,3,I think this calls for too many bananas. Thanks though. Some people still liked it.
123897,25885,2008-10-02,5,"This is really nice smelling bread.  The aroma of the batter before baking was incredible. I made it in a bundt pan. Used 5 overripe bananas. Edited: I tried it again the next day and it is really good. Not too sweet, good body and moist.  Keeper."
865653,25885,2008-10-02,5,"Perfect!  Not too sweet.  I halved this recipe, because I had only 2 overripe bananas to use up.  The only change I made was to use olive oil instead of butter--perhaps not as rich, but healthier, and it did not effect the texture.  I made 6 large muffins which baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Will definitely use this recipe again...maybe adding walnuts next time!"
659599,25885,2008-10-02,0,This was light and delicious.  I used muffin tins and cooked it for 30 minutes (to save on energy)
18344,25885,2008-10-05,5,"Wow! fantastic, i added chocolate chips and 1/2c of walnuts. i used whole wheat flour. be sure to use super ripe bananas."
626096,25885,2008-10-14,5,"I made some changes to accommodate my gluten free diet, but this was the best bread I've had in two years! I cut all the ingredients in half to make a small loaf. I used Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose gluten free flour, 1 cup of banana, and 1/4 cup of applesauce. I also sprinkled in a little cinnamon and nutmeg. I baked it for 35 minutes, and it was absolutely to die for. Thank you so much for posting!"
800697,25885,2008-10-19,5,"I made it exactly ! I was really worried when I cut it that maybe it wasn't done , but ended up perfect and definitely very banana-E . Will make this again for sure ."
685621,25885,2008-10-19,5,OMG - this is the best banana bread ever!  Enough said.
340776,25885,2008-10-19,5,"Excellent, moist, delicious, flavorful banana bread - this'll be my go-to recipe from now on. Thank you!"
941935,25885,2008-10-24,5,"One word, Deliciously Moist! The best banana bread ever made. Thank You!"
80998,25885,2008-10-24,5,"Great banana bread. I made some today with some bananas that were browning. I don't usually change recipes, but decided to add the streusal topping from  Recipe #43509. It turned out fantastic.  The bread was moist with a crunchy sweet top."
218427,25885,2008-10-27,5,"This is the BEST banana bread recipe!  I had no idea it would take so many bananas to make 2 1/3 cups, so I used 3 containers of my daughter's baby food, and it still wasn't enough!  It was only 1/3 cup, so I threw in some canola oil and vanilla.  Unlike most banana bread recipes, you can REALLY taste the banana flavor.  I divided it 3 ways:  plain, with chopped walnuts, and with walnuts and chocolate chips.  I used mini loaf pans, and they baked up in about 25 minutes.  If you're having trouble with the middle cooking, I suggest using a smaller pan, because it worked out great.  Thank you so much for sharing!"
654460,25885,2008-10-28,5,"I wished I could have been able to give this 10 stars.   Fantastic recipe.  This is not a bread, but it is a cake!  Just loved it.   I added a handful of golden raisins, fresh nutmeg, few drops of Vanilla extract & butter flavoring.   Made it in Bundt pan, at 350 for 50 min.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this again & again.

Ferryal"
862099,25885,2008-11-01,5,Very good.  I usually like more sugary bannana bread then this but this was a nice change.  I wasnt overwhelmed with sugar so the bannana flavor really came through.  I used nice blackened bannanas.  I also added a tsp of vanilla because i felt so wrong not to.  It is indeed great toasted.  Thank you Shelley!
866747,25885,2008-11-03,5,"This recipe was amazing!!! I had some very ripe bananas and a mood for baking that day. I wanted to make some bread pudding but then changed my mind when I saw this recipe. This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted, not even the banana bread used at my favourite breakfast place to make ""Banana Bread French Toasts"" is as good as this! I did tweak the recipe a little.  I only used half the amount of butter called, and to make up for the missing fat I added a half a cup of unsweetened apple sauce. I also added vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, cranberries, raisins, pine nuts, walnuts, pecans, and some semisweet chocolate chips. Since I only had two medium bananas and it wasnt enough to make it moist, I added some milk(like a Tbsp) also to add the moisture the oats would absorb. I know this sounds like a lot to do, but it was just that i had some extra time and various ingredients in my pantry. I baked it for 55 minutes at 350 degrees F. It came out perfectly brown and crunchy on the outside but I very moist on the inside. My whole family loved it! They even asked for more!(something that my sister rarely does, or my mother who doesn't like chocolate chips!!!) :O. I will deffinitely make this recipe again very soon. I'm probably going to try to bake them in muffin tins as Bogey'sMom suggested. Thank you very much Shelley!!! I loved it."
139306,25885,2008-11-08,5,"My husband said, ""This is the best one yet.""  So, I guess this recipe is a keeper.  I subbed half the butter for applesauce and added a little cinnamon and vanilla.  The bread was really moist - to the point that I was worried that it wasn't cooked all the way, but it was just super moist and yummy in the end.  I found that if you don't have over-ripe bananas, you can mash them up some and then microwave them for a little bit and that helps to get them all mushy and ready for the batter."
279357,25885,2008-11-09,4,good. i added vanilla. i made it in a scone pan. it only took 15-20 min to cook that way.
683666,25885,2008-11-10,5,"Delicious banana bread recipe!  I added vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and chocolate chips and think those additions made a lot of difference in the taste.  I used part of the batter for muffins and I put the rest in a smaller loaf pan and I had no problem with things cooking through, although I did give the loaf an extra ten minutes in the oven."
338515,25885,2008-11-11,5,Beautiful banana read recipe!  There's a simple solution to those wanting to bake it in a loaf pan without the edges burning - simply cover the pan with a small tent of foil (so that the pan is sealed).  Remove it 5 minutes before the end to allow the top to brown up a bit more.  This traps the moisture and prevents the top sides from burning.  I used 1/2 wholemeal / 1/2 plain and the result was a beautiful and evenly cooked cake.  I also double sifted the flour for lightness.
296970,25885,2008-11-17,5,"With so many possitive reviews I would've been shocked had this bread not turned out wonderful. It was great. Moist and buttery, simple ingredients... could baking get any easier?! Loved it."
1023247,25885,2008-11-17,5,"I prepared this recipe using 4 overripe bananas, which came out ot be only 1.5 cups. I added one snack-size apple sauce which brought it up to 2 cups. I lacked the extra 1/3 cup but made no adjustments except to put a tad less than 2 cups flour in. Used a potato masher to mash the bananas, I also added 1 tsp vanilla a good shaking of cinnamon. It made 12 muffins, which I filled almost to the top with batter and baked for 40 minutes. The result was a lightly crisp top and a moist inside. My young kids devoured these and my only regret was that I couldn't have made more to share. I'll be buying extra bananas from now on - some to eat ripe, and some to overripen to make these muffins again."
829870,25885,2008-11-19,5,Great banana bread recipe. Thanks
1028335,25885,2008-11-22,2,I did something wrong because it was very heavy. I used 5 bananas but may have stirred a bit too much : (
525159,25885,2008-11-23,4,"The recipe was good!  Was very moist and flavorable.
Thank you."
114287,25885,2008-11-23,5,"I been making this banana bread for years now and just now I'm getting around to review it.  Its a wonderful easy desert bread, supper easy and fast to put together.  One thing for sure make  sure you have enough bananas.  The amount of bananas gives this bread the wonderful flavor and makes it moist.  Like I said before was making it for years and will continue to make it for years more."
795210,25885,2008-11-26,5,I made this to take over to a friend 'game' night and EVERYONE loved it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
691737,25885,2008-11-26,5,"Soooooo good!  I used the bundt pan and a loaf pan on different occasions. Both delicious!
I also tried the recipe using canned pumpkin in place of the bananna. Added dates & walnuts. Moist rich pumpkiny (word?) bread."
540295,25885,2008-12-05,5,Absolutely FABULOUS!!!
6512,25885,2008-12-07,5,"WOW!!! This was the best banana bread I ever made. DELICIOUS!!!! I had 4 banana's that died on top of the refrigerator, they were so over ripe they were solid black. And this recipe was exactly what I needed. I never measured the banana's after I mashed them, but it must have been the perfect amount as this banana bread had such a strong banana flavor it didn't last 24 hours in our house. I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. Thanks for posting I'll be making this quite often from now on!!!"
495032,25885,2008-12-08,5,Excellent!  Thank you.
690635,25885,2008-12-09,5,"This is my all-time favorite recipe.  I found it on this website a few months ago and have made it many times.  It is a delicious, fast, no-fail way to use up those over-ripe bananas.  With this recipe, I can have a loaf of banana bread in the oven in less than 10 minutes.  It's great!"
888736,25885,2008-12-13,5,I don't know if I can say anything more about this banana bread. It was so moist and delicious. I am sure I will be making this a lot. Thanks
732581,25885,2008-12-16,5,"I have a family recipe I usually use, but the reviews for this one were so outstanding, I had to try- I'm glad I did.  This is officially my new banana bread recipe!  I added some vanilla and baked in mini-pans to put in goodie baskets.  I just ate a whole mini-pan myself!  I did three mini loaves with walnuts and three without.  FANTASTIC!  Thank you!"
374520,25885,2008-12-19,5,I followed the recommendation to bake it in a bundt pan and I also added in about 1/2 a cup of walnuts too.  This was an amazing banana bread and I can't wait to make it into muffins for a morning snack.  Thank you for posting.
420929,25885,2008-12-27,5,I made this as a regular loaf and it was EXCELLENT. I used 4 very large bananas to equal the 2 1/3 cups.  I used the bread to make a Banana Bread Bread Pudding Recipe also on Recipezaar.
315055,25885,2009-04-29,3,It was a little too bland for my tastes.  I added some milk chocolate and peanut butter chips and it helped a little.
30503,25885,2008-12-28,4,"This was pretty good over all. It did take a full 15 minutes longer than listed to cook fully, I even have a mercury thermometer in my oven, so it was definitely at the right temp. I added some chopped pecans, cinnamon and nutmeg for flavor."
360437,25885,2008-12-28,0,Who would have thought that the secret to fabulous banana bread was BANANAS?!?!? I chose this recipe because of the number of reviews and it calls for twice as much banana as most other recipes I've made (I had a lot to use up). Just delicious! I'll make this again for sure!
88732,25885,2009-01-03,5,"I made this wonderful bread in 4 mini loaf pans which took 55 minutes at 350*.  With 532 reviews already under it's belt, my review can hardly add too much but I too chose this recipe because it used so many bananas.
It delivers with texture, flavor and ease of preparation too.
This will be added to my ""Best of Zaar so Far"" cookbook.
Thanks,
KCShell"
439056,25885,2009-01-13,5,"This is the BEST banana bread you will ever eat! OMG! It was so perfect! Way better than the kind you can get at Starbucks or the grocery store! Definitely, you should make this banana bread!!!! :)"
325318,25885,2009-01-14,5,This was a great banana bread.  I only ended up with 2 cups of banana so I added a 1/3 of a cup sour cream to it.  I also added 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon and used I cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour.  Definitely will be making this again!
560694,25885,2009-01-14,5,"This is now my banana bread recipe.  Not only was it fast & easy to make but it baked up beautifully (in the bundt pan, 45 minutes for my oven), is moist without being mushy at all & has the *best* banana flavor, natural flavor, I've tasted in a banana bread in a long time.
My changes:
Subbed 1 cup whole wheat flour, added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp vanilla & sprinkled the top with chopped walnuts.  Took me 6 bananas to get the 2 1/3c & it was well worth it.  Greased the bundt pan using the butter wrapper & it came out w/o any prodding.  Thank SO much for sharing & for all the helpful suggestions posted by other bakers."
662565,25885,2009-01-14,5,I made this today.  I increased the recipe by half and didn't measure the mashed banana - I used about 6 or 7 very ripe ones and just tossed them in the mixer and let my Kitchen Aid mash them.  I used a bundt pan and baked for about 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I also added 2 cups of chopped walnuts.  It came out very moist and lots of flavor!!  Very yummy and will be making again!
377499,25885,2009-01-21,5,Excellent and well received by all! I was a little surprised using 6 bananas but it works. Will add chopped walnuts next time.
1141779,25885,2009-01-24,5,"Thanks for this great recipe. 
I am making this banana bread almost every week. I added 1/2 C chopped walnut and 1/4 C of chocolate, and it tasted even better!"
1054943,25885,2009-01-25,5,"I also made muffins, since I don't have a good pan for bread. They're delicious!"
1049709,25885,2009-01-25,5,I used a combo of wheat and white flour.  I used only 2/4ths c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. honey instead.  I made them into big muffins (20 minutes bake) for my toddler's breakfast.
350750,25885,2009-01-25,5,I love banana bread and loved this recipe. Thanks!
65502,25885,2009-01-25,5,I love finding a recipe for my black freezer bananas! This was really good and had a nice crunchy top when done. Thanks.
645916,25885,2009-01-25,5,I followed the recipe exactly...delicious! Super moist & great banana flavor. It doesn't need any spices.
273358,25885,2009-01-27,1,"sorry, this totally didn't work for me. I thought that with 546 reviews I couldn't go wrong but...
Even though I used a bundt pan and baked for 80 (!!!) minutes, it still weasn't cooked in the middle. I sliced the cake and toasted it in a last ditch attempt to save something, and the result had an odd texture (though I admit the taste was great). I will not be trying this again."
18745,25885,2009-02-06,5,Super easy to make with few ingredients compared to some Banana Bread recipes.  I used a bundt pan to bake and it was so pretty when it came out of the oven.  (picture posted) No problem with sticking and it was done in the middle when baked the recommended time.  Incredibly moist with a excellent banana flavor. It will be my new recipe for banana bread.  Thanks!
412169,25885,2009-02-07,5,"Thanks for the excellent recipe! I used 5 ripe bananas, followed the recipe exactly but did add one tsp of vanilla extract. My loaf pan was just a bit smaller but worked fine. At 60 min baking it wasn't quite done so checked again every 5 min and removed from the oven after 70 min. It was perfect and even better the second day. Very moist and flavourful and a beautiful texture. Will consider adding chopped walnuts next time."
1150294,25885,2009-02-09,4,"It was good!

Maybe next time I'll add more brown sugar!!

overall, great!!!


Thanks!!!"
713272,25885,2009-02-11,5,"Awesome! I'm just another five star review, but I did make a few changes so thought I'd add my two cents. My purpose was a healthy snack for my 3yr old and 1yr old. So I subbed half the flour for whole wheat flour, half the butter for unsweetened applesauce and I added 1/4c ground flax. I made 12 muffins and baked for 30min and they were perfect. This is hands down the best banana bread I have ever had. Thank you!!!"
485151,25885,2009-05-07,4,This made a very dense banana bread- which is just the kind I like! I loved the texture and it baked perfectly in my oven. Next time I will add 1 tsp vanilla & cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to it.
536944,25885,2009-02-18,5,"Very good and easy recipe. I followed the other suggestions of other reviewers and made this in a bundt pan and baked for 40 minutes which was perfect. I also added 1/4 cup ground flax seed, and used 2 cups whole grain spelt flour instead of all-purpose flour. I also added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. I think this would be fantastic with toasted pecans or walnuts added in the batter, maybe some chocolate chips. Yum!"
745944,25885,2009-02-18,0,"OK, I have tried this twice, and sorry to go against so many positive reviews, but it did not turn out great for me.  Both times, it was dense, not sweet at all and just kind of doughy!! not a good flavor at all.  I cooked it properly so that was not the problem.  Sorry to say, I will not use or recomemnd this recipe again."
173314,25885,2009-02-20,5,excellent loaf of banana bread. moist and tasty. it rose up  perfect and had wonderful golden color. thank you
863903,25885,2009-02-20,5,"Best banana bread ever. Seriously. Flavor was perfect, super moist. I made muffins. Didn't last for a day."
105601,25885,2009-02-20,5,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to try this with banana muffins instead of bread.  They were delicious, and healthy too.  I forgot to check the timer so just kept checking them with a toothpick--I think it took somewhere around 25-30 minutes in all.  I got 18 muffins total which makes the calorie count really reasonable. Good recipe!"
1138172,25885,2009-02-21,5,delicious! i had it in the oven for the full 65 minutes and it turned out perfectly!
1156651,25885,2009-02-22,5,"This is a yummy recipe.  I've never made banana bread before so this was a great success for my virgin attempt.

I did only have 4 bananas, which was just shy of 2 cups.  I added some over-thickened homemade kefir to make up the rest.

Since I was planning to share (if it turned out) with my neighbors I did not add nuts, not knowing if they're ""nut"" people.  I did throw in a handful of cranberry ""craisins"" just for a little extra color and texture.

It cooked just fine in a loaf pan for one hour.  Very moist and delicious!

Thanks to Shelley for posting."
289444,25885,2009-02-22,3,I figured with so many good reviews that this would be amazing.  I found it to be just okay and will not make again.  We did not like the texture or flavor.  I subsequently tried a couple other Zaar banana bread recipes and was much happier with them.
739457,25885,2009-02-28,5,"This was great!  It tasted ""just like Mom's.""  However, I had to make a few changes since I was running low on ingredients - I used egg beaters, about half the amount of butter, and added vanilla."
323328,25885,2009-03-05,4,"This was pretty good!  I have to say that I took ""pies and cakes and cookies my!""'s advice and cooked in a loaf pan for 90 minutes at 325 since I was not at home and didn't have a Bundt pan.  I did check after 60 minutes and frequently after that because I was using an oven that I'm not familiar with.  The lower heat allows the bread to get done more consistently.  As many others noted, don't be alarmed by the darkness of it.  I also added a liberal sprinkling of cinnamon."
830826,25885,2009-03-07,5,"Wow!  Great recipe.  I have now made it a few times.  This last time I went to the produce lady (we live in Hungary) and specifically asked for her overripe bananas.  Cook time is longer in my oven- more like 80 mins for the knife to come out clean.   Works really well with dark brown sugar or combo of both white and brown.  Also, if you are serving it for a special event, bake it one day before.  It is great the 1st day but AWESOME the second!"
13625,25885,2009-03-10,5,"Excellent, easy recipe. I made it with whole wheat and a spoonful of cinnamon and it worked out great."
225631,25885,2009-03-11,5,I have made this several times and everyone loves it! I especially like that there are no nuts in it! Thank you!
987558,25885,2009-03-18,5,best banana bread out there last time I added dried cranberries and wallnuts..delish
179757,25885,2009-03-26,5,We like this. We have made it twice already. Even better later in the day.
273722,25885,2009-03-26,5,I've made this several times...it's my favorite banana bread recipe. Always a hit in our house!
533513,25885,2009-04-09,5,"I don't write reviews very often, but I had to for this bread.  It seems every time I make banana bread, it is almost burned on the outside and runny on the inside.  I read through several of the reviews and here's what I did:  Used 5 old bananas, added about 1 t of cinnamon and a couple shakes of nutmeg.  I baked it 350 for 40 minutes in a bundt pan.  I sprayed the pan first, and swished around some sugar (like you would do with flour), to give the outside of the bread a little extra sweet crunch.  It was the best banana bread I've ever had, and my family was duly impressed.  Thanks for this recipe.  It is the only one I will use from now on!!"
710414,25885,2009-04-11,3,"This bread turned out OK for us. It has a great banana taste, but is a little stickier on the inside than we like.  I like how the slices turned out and didn't fall apart. I might make muffins with this recipe and see if it turns out a little drier."
1225715,25885,2009-04-19,5,I just had to write a review after trying another banana bread recipe on this site that was sooo inferior to this recipe.  I cooked the bread in two 3 by 9 loaf pans in my toaster oven for 1 hour and they were toothpick test done.   I didn't have the problem others stated of the mushy interior.  It might be because I use a smaller loaf pan.  Very delicious... I will make again.
440073,25885,2009-04-22,4,"Good, but not the best banana bread I've tried.  Thanks for the recipe!"
416537,25885,2009-05-10,4,Quick easy recipe...I've made this a few times and learned to add some vanilla and a touch of cinnamon to give it a little more flavor.  Cooking time is close to 75-80 minutes in a glass pan.
808587,25885,2009-05-11,3,"The banana flavor was very good but it took much longer than 65 minutes to bake.  I ended up baking for 90 minutes.  Maybe it was because I used a glass breadpan, but it seemed that all the extra banana made the batter very wet.  If I make this again I will deffinately bake it longer."
38281,25885,2009-05-18,3,"We baked this banana bread in a bundt pan.  Our bread was done in 45-50 minutes, my oven may run a little hot.  We added pecans and fresh blueberries that we mashed up and it was delish! Thank you for a great recipe Shelley!"
234727,25885,2009-05-21,5,Delicious version of banana bread.  I did add cinnamon and walnuts and baked in a bundt pan.  Its unbelievably good toasted -- makes the butter come forward.  Great recipe ... we will make again and again.  Thank you!
218535,25885,2009-05-26,2,I found this to be bland. Not much of banana flavor. I may add more sugar and bananas next time. Recipe #9351 is a much better recipe.
843706,25885,2009-05-27,5,"This was the best!!!!Loved it but I did add the extras as recommended by other reviewers like the 1/2 C pecans, 1/2 C sour cream, 1 t vanilla, 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/2 t cardamom. It was perfect and the house filled aroma...WOW"
652568,25885,2009-05-27,5,"Like many who have tried LOTS of banana bread recipes.. I have.. I have had some descent results until today.. I don't have to try a NEW one anymore. this is in my box. I doubled the recipe baked in an angel food cake pan for 1hr and 45 minutes @325. This bread came out awesome. Came out super moist, dark, and the aroma was/is excellent. I did have some extra carmel sauce I made for brownies a few nights ago. When I turned this out on the cake plate. I drizzled that over the bread. Excellent. Thanks Shelly for a recipe that is a tradition keeper."
1064617,25885,2009-05-29,3,"This has a good flavor, but was extremely extremely wet.  Might be better to use the bundt pan, or muffin tins."
494806,25885,2009-06-03,5,Love this bread!
173306,25885,2009-06-28,5,"I made this in muffins very successfully, and folks loved it!"
1052873,25885,2009-06-28,5,"The first time I made this it was really gooey in the middle. This time I followed various suggestions of other posters. Used 1/4 cup salad oil instead of butter, used 5 very ripe bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, about 1/2 cup of walnut halves and pieces. Filled 12 regular size muffin cups to the top, 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Perfect!"
1125541,25885,2009-06-30,5,"Thank you for your wonderful recipe. Made very few changes. I did double the recipe and it worked out great. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla like other reviewers suggested and it came out great. I did not have to bake it any longer then 60 minutes (Maybe it's the Altitude, I like in Montana). I greased my pans with butter and sprinkled it with a touch of salt just for a little contrast to the sweetness. I also used a potato ricer to mash my bananas and I really think it helped make a smooth, creamy batter. I plan on using my second loaf to make banana french toast tomorrow morning!"
1183163,25885,2009-07-13,5,"This is an excellent (and easy!) banana bread. I've made t twice and both times I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. It's excellent toasted with some butter. I'm using it as a base for a birthday cake I'm making this week. The second  time I added about 3/4 C toasted walnuts, and it worked well. I can't recommend it highly enough!"
147076,25885,2009-07-14,4,"Original review:
I have never given a low review, but I thought this was way too gooey for my family.   It seemed like it was undercooked, but I baked it for the 65 min. in a bunt pan like another reviewer suggested (I would not even like to think of what it would have been like in a loaf pan), and the toothpick came out clean, so I am going to say this is what is supposed to be like.  If you want a traditional banana bread, try another recipe.  If you want a banana mush, you would probably like this one.  I guess my family just likes the more traditional bread.  It does have a nice flavor though, just not the right texture  for us.

Gave it another try:

I made this again (I actually did not realize it was the same recipe I had used before).  I replaced 1/2c flour with bran, and added one tsp. vanilla, and some dates that I had on hand.  The texture this time was great!!  The flavor was great!!  This version was gone by the end of the second day."
970667,25885,2009-07-15,5,"The BEST banana bread! I too cooked it in a bundt pan. I added some chopped pecans to the batter. I sprinkled sugar on the top. I cooked it at 325 for  45mins. and it turned out perfect!
This is a keeper!!!"
136369,25885,2009-07-20,5,"No need to look any further for a banana bread recipe because this is fantastic! We have several banana bread lovers in our family and they all gave it a huge thumbs up! My bananas weren't quite ripe, so I placed them in a brown paper bag and folded the top of the bag over to sit for a couple of days. This rippened them nicely. I baked the bread for 1 hour and 25 minutes at 375 degrees (I think my oven is slow). It was perfect! This is my banana bread recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing!"
792255,25885,2009-07-20,5,Wow! This is fantastic. I cooked mine in a bundt pan and added one cup of chocolate chips. It came out very dense and very moist. Tastes amazing!
718620,25885,2009-07-21,5,"so good.  i used 1/2 whole wheat flour, replaced some of the butter with applesauce and some of the brown sugar with honey - in my ever increasing attempts to eat healthier...and, it turned out amazing"
768828,25885,2009-07-21,5,"This was awesome.  Like another writer, I too was looking for a recipe that used more over-ripe bananas as I had 4 1/2.  After reading another writer's review about baking in a bundt pan, that is what I did.  Turned out beautifully in 45 minutes.  I added a cup of pecans - perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe."
227652,25885,2009-07-24,5,"Like this recipe needs another review but what the hey...can't resist! This is for my husband & while it's still cooling, the smell & the beautiful browness are sure to be a winner! I took great advice from others--used half white/whole wheat flour-half butter & applesauce-added vanilla & used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup Splenda. Using up more bananas was a HUGE plus. I also threw in about 1/3 cup mini choc chips. Can't wait to freeze this so he can have a sweet treat anytime!! Thanks so much for sharing this."
775963,25885,2009-07-27,5,"Superb!  I had six over ripe bananas and I didn't want it to come out as pudding, so I added an additional 1/4 cup of flour and they were perfect!  made muffins instead of a loaf.  Also added 1/2 tsp baking powder to give it a little lift.  Excelent!"
738401,25885,2009-07-27,5,"Oh, boy is this good!  I made it a while back and the only change that I made after reading a bunch of reviews is to add a teaspoon of real vanilla extract.  This is so moist and tasty - I love it! Plus, it's easy. What more can I say?  Fantastic and thanks for sharing."
57089,25885,2009-07-28,5,This was the first recipe I added to my main cookbook several years ago.  It's my go-to banana bread recipe.  It's easy & delicious - just doesnt get any better than that!
100856,25885,2009-07-28,5,OMG!!!!!! This is BY FAR the absolute BEST Banana bread I have ever made!!!! My husband LOVES banana bread so I make it ALOT. And this recipe is the BEST! The outside it crunchy and great and the inside is almost like pudding it is SO MOIST!! LOVE IT!
825116,25885,2009-07-29,5,"This is a great recipe, howwever, I did tweak it and I think the latest result came out beautifully. Before I mixed my batter I smushed my bananas and added a few tablespoons white sugar, brown sugar, and honey to them and set them in the fridge until I was ready to mix. I didn't tweak the batter recipe at all except that I did use 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 and I think this bread has the perfect sweetness and texture. AWESOME ! and my husband LOVED IT."
917568,25885,2009-08-02,5,"Mmm, yummy bread.  I made a half batch since there's just the two of us, and I ended up with five big, gorgeous muffin tops.   I used half whole wheat flour and cut out half the butter, because I never like as much butter as any recipe states.  Sprinkled a tiny bit of demerara sugar on the tops, and bingo!  Husb ate two as soon as he walked in the door.  You can't argue with nearly 600 positive reviews, and I believe I have found my regular banana bread recipe.  Thanks, Shelley."
562865,25885,2009-08-07,5,"Great recipe!  I have made it a few times now, and we love it.  I use applesauce instead of butter, egg whites, and do a brown sugar/Splenda blend and it still comes out perfectly! Sometimes I add a little bit of cocoa powder, and/or chocolate chips.  It is also great with toasted pecans chopped up and thrown in.  Thanks for the great recipe Shelley."
731635,25885,2009-08-08,5,Yummy bread with perfect texture!  I did make it healthier by using wholemeal flour and subbing low fat vanilla yoghurt for the butter.  I also used only 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  This may be why it took only 50 mins to cook in my oven.
166294,25885,2009-08-09,5,I have never made banana bread with so many bananas before.  It was really good!
672734,25885,2009-08-18,1,"I subbed nonfat yogurt for the butter and used whole wheat flour. It baked super fast, in about 30 minutes since I only did half the recipe. I was not a fan."
1325653,25885,2009-08-31,5,made the recipe into muffins and topped them with crushed nestle crunch.. yum yum! my husband loved it!
1049724,25885,2009-09-03,4,"I didn't have nutmeg and didn't feel like fumbling through my pantry at 6AM to find the vanilla extract, so I just did 1 teaspoon cinnamon in addition to the recipe's ingredients. It didn't come out as good as I'd hoped - next time I will put the muffins on a higher rack so that it doesn't come out over-browned on the bottom like it did this time.  I had the muffins in for 32 minutes, but perhaps it should've been more like 20-25 minutes."
320114,25885,2009-09-03,4,"Very moist, yummy, I added a little extra sugar the second time I made it and a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and a dash of vanilla....Perfect."
457226,25885,2009-09-03,5,"This came out great in my 9x9.  Due to a shortage of black bananas, I had to make some adjustments, so I added a bit of buttermilk to my 3 mashed bananas.  It came out fantastically delicious!  Everybody really enjoyed it, but I might have to call mine Banana Bread because there is less banana in mine than the original recipe.  Ahhh, there's always next time!"
49918,25885,2009-09-03,5,Delicious!  I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and baked it in a bundt pan.  Thanks for posting!
1376727,25885,2009-09-07,5,"Excellent!!  I did 1/2 all purpose flour, 1/2 bran then added 4 banana's topped up by applesauce to make equivenant and added peanut butter, choc chips and walnuts.   Supper moist and yummy."
159084,25885,2009-09-08,4,"Like this needs another review!!  Very tasty, easy to put together - I liked the fact that it used 2 & 1/3c bananas (I had alot of ripe ones to use up)  I added mini chocolate chips and baked it in a bundt pan for 50 mins."
3111,25885,2009-09-09,5,"Very good. Excellent point...why compromise the banana flavor?!  This takes care of that issue. Love the brown sugar in this, as well as extra bananas.  I had a banana that was still a little firm and the banana ""bits"" from it only added to the end result of the bread!  Thanks."
321866,25885,2009-09-12,5,Very yummy! Threw in a couple handfuls of chocolate chips and some cinnamon. Worked great but probably wasn't necessary. Nice and moist without being mushy.
996290,25885,2009-09-13,4,"Made this in a bundt pan, which I usually do for banana and zucchini breads. This results in a delicious banana pudding cake - I think ""banana bread"" is a misnomer. I would serve this fresh out of the oven with some vanilla bean ice cream for dessert. There is a bit of caramelization that goes on, too, which makes it even yummier - but again, notsomuch banana *bread* as dessert. But definitely a keeper!"
345224,25885,2009-09-17,4,"Very easy and delicious.  I halved all the ingredients as I only had one very very ripe banana to use up.  I then poured the mix into silicone muffin pan and made six yummy muffins.  Perfect and so simple,thank you."
236104,25885,2009-09-18,5,"Best banana bread ever! I didn't have brown sugar so I used the icing sugar+molasses substitution. I added cinnamon to the dry mix and added chopped walnuts to the top after I put the mix into the loaf pan. Mine was done after 45 mins! Thankfully I read the review about the timing.I stuck the loaf pan in the freezer for 10 mins. I had buttered the loaf pan before putting the mix in and it came right out. This recipe took quite a few dishes to prepare everything, but it was worth it =) thanks!"
266032,25885,2009-09-18,5,"So yummy! Don't be fooled if you have a bite once it cools enough to slice a piece because you may not notice the banana flavor. If you have the willpower to wait the next day, the banana flavor really shines! Will def make again!!!

Only had 3 bananas, which worked fine. Used half wheat flour and it's still scrumptious. Also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Lastly, made it without eggs using an egg replacement and it turned out fine."
1010264,25885,2009-09-20,5,Awesome! I used a 12 cup muffin pan and filled the cups almost to the top- I wanted to use all of the batter. They turned out great- like muffins. This was moist and delicious- I'm sending some over to a friend! Now I just need to get some country crock and I'll be straight! BTW- It only took about 50 min for mine to be done!
120554,25885,2009-09-22,5,I have been making this bread for a couple of years now and it is always so good!  I made muffins with the recipe recently and they were a huge hit with my kids!  The recipe made 15 muffins and were done in about 35 minutes.
980012,25885,2009-09-26,5,LOVE IT!!!  I really like how little sugar it uses.  I usually make a sour cream banana bread but this is now my recipe!  I added walnuts and flax seed for a little crunch and extra protein.
4740,25885,2009-09-27,5,"I am updating my review.  I made this again with really ripe bananas, and it came out perfect.  I think that is the key.  The outside does get pretty brown, but the inside is really moist and sweet.

OLD Review from Nov. 2007 - 3 stars - One daughter gave it thumbs up.  The other daughter gave it thumbs down.  It didn't do me.  I'm looking for more sweetness."
277481,25885,2009-09-28,5,"An egg-less adaptation-
To replace the eggs, use 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  Mix together in a little pyrex dish separate from all the other ingredients.  Once it starts bubbling and fizzing, add it to the batter.  This is my all time favorite banana bread.  I was heartbroken when my son became allergic to eggs.  I thought that meant he wouldn't be able to have this perfect treat.  But this adaptation has given us the same results as the recipe with the eggs.  It may be just my oven, but I've had to increase the baking time to 70 minutes.  
Thank you so much for a DELICIOUS recipe!"
305346,25885,2009-10-02,5,"Wow! This was so good. I was so excited to try this from the rave reviews and was disappointed to realize my bananas only added up to 1 1/4 cups, but I decided to halve the recipe (cooked about a half hr) and it came out perfect! I'm going to buy more bananas today so I can try the full recipe. I also added a little cream cheese frosting and it was superb."
961578,25885,2009-10-03,5,"Excellent!  I didn't have quite enough banana so I added some apple sauce to make up the difference.  Needed to bake for about 70 minutes, but was very moist."
1187259,25885,2009-10-09,5,"I just made half of this recipe since I only had enough ingredients for that and added cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg and made muffins and they are amazing!!! So moist and easy and baked it for about 40 minutes. Great Recipe!!!"
1154516,25885,2009-10-10,5,"This banana bread turned out great.  I used five overripe bananas, and though I'm at high altitude (over 6000 ft.), I didn't have to adjust the recipe (e.g. flours, sugars) at all.  Thanks for sharing!"
443633,25885,2009-10-11,5,The second time I made this recipe  I was sure to have the full amount of bananas required and added some vanilla.  The bread is excellent
125512,25885,2009-10-18,5,"I made some healthy changes and it turned out pretty good.  I used 4 bananas (should have used 5), subbed 1 c. whole wheat pastry flour, used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. butter (instead of all butter)."
1133190,25885,2009-10-21,3,"I'm sorry but this wasn't the best banana bread I've ever had. I typically like my banana bread sweeter and I'm not sure I liked using brown sugar vs. white.  The bread was good, just not great."
266891,25885,2009-10-21,3,"I had such high hopes for this recipe but I was disappointed. It was very moist, but the taste lacked sweetness and flavor, even when I added a crumb (butter/sugar/flour) topping. I used 7 small overripe bananas but still wasn't enough. I don't think I'll be making this again."
671156,25885,2009-10-22,5,"The best recipe I've used that doesn't call for sour cream!
I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using marg instead of butter, and it turned out really well. Great flavour, and texture. The only tip I have is that I found the 60-65 minute cooking time to be far too long.  I left it in for 50 minutes, and the bottom is a deep brown and really tough. (I love it like that! But my husband considers it overcooked).  I will definitely make it again, but will only cook it for 40-45 minutes. (I used 2 bread pans).  
Thanks Shelley for an excellent banana bread recipe!! ^.^"
1187622,25885,2009-10-25,5,"Delicious!  I made this recipe into muffins and they did turn a dark brown but crispy on top and so good.   I don't like soggy muffins or bread.  This would be an excellent recipe to make into a loaf then toast it.  I did make a couple changes.  First of all after getting all the dry ing. together I realized I didn't have enough bananas, but they were very ripe added a dash of cinnamon and a couple handsful of oat bran.  (trying to use it up)   Baked about 40 minutes and had no problem with them being pudding like.  Not sure if it was because I didn't have the full banana amount.  Great Recipe for lunch boxes.  Thank you."
137477,25885,2009-10-26,5,Absolutely the best; and simple!  I use this recipe every time I have extra ripe bananas.
1258008,25885,2009-11-02,5,"This banana bread was so soft, moist, and had an amazing flavor.  It does come out a little dark, so if you're really into something that ""looks"" perfect, this may not be it, but it sure tastes perfect!  I guess bananas just bake that way--I will definitely do this one again!  Maybe with a cream cheese frosting type spread..."
1028637,25885,2009-11-05,5,definitely 5 star!!! makes excellent waffles too- for a quick breakfast.
511719,25885,2009-11-15,5,Absolutely delicious! One of the best banana bread recipes I have ever tried! Perfect for my super ripe/rotting bananas that I was tempted to throw away this morning! I will be using this recipe again!
369118,25885,2009-11-17,5,This is the BEST banana bread I have ever had.  It is super moist and absolutely perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing!!!
88717,25885,2009-11-18,5,"Wow! This is the best banana bread I've eaten. It's very moist and really easy to make. I also like the fact that the ingredients are everyday staples I have on hand. I don't use buttermilk or sour cream often, so it's nice to have a recipe that doesn't call for them. I am, however, going to try using applesauce instead of the butter to make it a bit more healthy. Thank you for posting this recipe!"
212558,25885,2009-11-18,3,We wanted to love this as much as the other reviewers but it just didnt happen. Not much banana flavor though it was a moist bread.
208455,25885,2009-11-19,5,"DELISH!  Super moist.  Had all ingred. on hand which I love.  This will replace my mom's recipe - though I won't be telling her that :)  this is very, very good."
1249089,25885,2009-11-21,5,"My husband and kids loved this recipe.  I mistakenly had saved only 3 overripe bananas so it didn't make the whole amount of mashed it called for, so I added a little unsweetened applesauce.  My husband and I actually liked that the banana flavor was not to overwhelming.  I am making again today with the full amount of bananas."
850974,25885,2009-12-04,5,"I used 1C. less banana (I didn't have enough) I was a little worried, but it came out fine. Not as banana-y as I would have liked, but I know it would have been had I had enough bananas. Also, I used half whole wheat pastry flour (and a little less flour total overall, we live at 6500ft.), without any ill side effects and with the bonus of extra fiber and nutrients. And..... to negate any benefits, we put some chocolate chips in the batter as well (helped out with the missing banana sumptuousness....) I would have added vanilla if I had any left.... (good thing I'm making some homemade extract as we speak) All in all: easy, fail-proof, and absolutely tasty!!"
1434290,25885,2009-12-04,5,"WOW  Just finished baking this banana bread and ate a warm slice right out of the oven.  Awesome receipe,  the best banana bread I have ever made and it's soooo easy.  Thank you!!"
9328,25885,2009-12-10,4,"I didn't have a loaf pan so I made ""mini cakes"" with them.  Recommendation to everyone... if you do this don't cook it for the full 60 minutes.  I took it out at 52 minutes and it was overcooked.  It still tastes good but I think I'll try to keep it closer to 40-45 minutes next time.  Also, my bananas were not as overripe as I thought so that may have affected it's ""moistness"" as well.  Overall I am pleased with the recipe as the number of ingredients was what I was looking for and time to bake as well :).  Thanks for sharing."
820822,25885,2009-12-11,5,"This was great!  I did change it a bit.....I doubled the recipe with great success...why make one loaf when you can make 2 in the same amount of time?  Also, I substituted 3/4 cup (of the doubled recipe) of flour for cocoa powder, and added both chocolate and peanut butter chips.  It turned out great and this will be my new bananna bread recipe."
291292,25885,2009-12-17,0,you changed your recipe. It is not the same recipe I made.
733257,25885,2009-12-19,2,"I thought I'd try this for a change from my normal recipe.  I don't know what went wrong, but it was very dry.  I always use plenty of bananas, so I know that wasn't the problem.  The kids liked it, but the husband won't touch it.  Now he wants me to make another batch with the old recipe."
538563,25885,2009-12-24,5,I've been making muffins using this recipe. I also add chopped pecans. It makes approximately 18 muffins and I bake them for 18-20 minutes. My family and I love this recipe and will definately make it again soon!
1282298,25885,2009-12-27,5,"This was awesome!  I made 12 regular muffins (filled almost to the rim with batter- had a good little muffin top) plus 12 mini muffins.  Cooked for 30 minutes and came out nice and golden and completed cooked through.  I used 5 regular sized overripe bananas (was 2 1/2 cups, but didn't want to throw away part of a banana)."
1155918,25885,2009-12-28,5,"Absolutely wonderful! Best banana bread ever! I had no probs with a gooey inside nor too dark outside. I made 6 mini bundts and 1 loaf from this recipe. I used 6 medium sized bananas. ***TIP*** If you will take your very ripe bananas and freeze them, then thaw them out (the skins will turn black) then the banana flavor increases immensely and they mash up very creamy. :)

I had to come back again and add to my post ... do not make the mistake of only making one batch of this yummy treat!  I did and now I have none leftover for tomorrow!  It is great that everyone raved over it .. but ... but .. *sniff*  I wanted some for tomorrow! LOL"
1054349,25885,2010-01-03,5,The best!  I like simple banana bread without nuts or chocolate chips.  This is very moist and has a very good banana flavor.  I used self-rising flour and left out the baking soda and added in 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  My husband liked it so much he packed it up and took it to work because we were going to eat the entire thing!
892498,25885,2010-01-06,5,"Delicious!  Incredibly moist, and it's so nice to know that it's not from oil!  I love this recipe.  Forgot to try adding cinnamon and vanilla, but I don't know that I would anyway."
751791,25885,2010-01-06,4,"I didn't quite have enough bananas for this and they probably could have been blacker despite being rather soft and spotty. That probably attributed to the fact that my batter wasn't as wet as it could have been and the fact that my muffins (cooked at 350 F for 20 mins.) weren't as sweet as it could have been. Next time, I'll wait until my bananas are completely black and use more of them.

I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and about 2/3 cup of chopped pecans. 

The crumb was typical of a banana nut muffin, not cake-like and not particularly moist which was a bit disappointing."
348068,25885,2010-01-07,5,"I made this for the holidays but didn't have time to share my thoughts. Turned out great! Very moist and not too sweet, which I appreciated. I froze some in muffin form and a small loaf. Both thawed nicely and were yummy! Thanks for for the post!"
106931,25885,2010-01-08,4,Delicious!
1482000,25885,2010-01-08,5,"Sooo delicious!!!
Ive made this two times now. Followed the recipe the first time- it was really nice and stayed moist for days! The second time I added a bit more mashed banana and about a cup of walnuts. It tastes so good that I doubt itll last a day in my house. Thank you for this great recipe! Best banana bread ive ever tasted!!"
228297,25885,2010-01-12,5,"I'll say this is outstanding carmarlized on the outside dense and chewy on the inside perfect. At 65 minutes my bread was done. I did however put a foil tent over my bread at the 30 minute mark. I'm having my morning coffee and this banana bread wondering how many banana's I should buy at the grocery!
Update 2010: I now add 1 teaspoon cinnimon and 1/2 cup pecans for my DH still wonderful!"
418179,25885,2010-01-14,5,"This is an excellent banana bread - it is very moist and dense, which I like. If you are looking for a dry, light banana bread, this is not the bread for you. 
I baked it in a bundt pan, and had no problems with it being done in the center; it was done in 45 minutes. The only change I might make is to up the salt a bit, to 1/2 a teaspoon, and I added 1/2 cup of pecans.
Thanks for posting this."
1418334,25885,2010-01-14,0,"This recipe was so easy and so yummy, the only change I made was to add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, I also sprinkled powdered sugar on the top once it cooled, It is really yummy. I might try adding some chocolate chips next time. My Hubby and I ate half to loaf, and it was a big loaf pan!!! Can not wait to try a piece toasted tonight for a snack-It is Really Moist and packed with banana flavor..And best of all it is EASY!!!!Thanks"
844554,25885,2010-01-15,5,"Well, I must agree with everybody else -- very moist and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Will use this one again and again. It's so easy, too."
400411,25885,2010-01-16,4,I'm only giving it 4 stars because I thought it was a little bland.  It really needs cinnamon or vanilla or...something.  It could be stellar if the right thing were added...it was very moist and banana-y.
535633,25885,2010-01-19,5,Very moist.  I enjoyed this very much.  Great flavor.  I am sure I will be baking another loaf of this very soon.  I don't think this will last past tomorrow morning breakfast.  Thanks for the great recipe which is a keeper.  Made for Jan. 2010 I Recommend Tag.
581487,25885,2010-01-21,4,We liked this. Could have been a little more sweet for us. Will make again with a little more sugar. Thanks!
425138,25885,2010-01-24,4,"Followed this recipe wit the tips (nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla). Half my bananas were not overripe so the flavour was not as great as it could have been. Next time I will wait for the bananas to get overripe."
364980,25885,2010-01-28,5,I haven't had banana bread in soooo long!  (since daughter went GF 6 years ago).  She made it clear that she doesn't like bananas and so didn't care if I made it with regular flour.  Yum!  Oh how I've missed thee!
890104,25885,2010-01-30,3,"Great banana bread, not too dry even with the 3 bananas I had - did 50 min. Followed rec. to use 1 tsp. vanilla & dash of cinnamon. Will be even more moist next time with more bananas."
1397246,25885,2010-01-30,5,Was very moist and the crust was caramelized and crunchy. I forgot to add the vanilla and cinnamon so I'm hoping it will be even better next time.
702607,25885,2010-02-06,4,Very good! It came out moist with a dense texture. I think I'll try it next time with some walnuts.
1546662,25885,2010-02-09,0,Good bread! Thank you!
841690,25885,2010-02-11,4,"I prepared this according to directions. I think it could use more baking soda. It was really too moist. I may cut down on the banana to 2 cup. I will tweek this, but it is definately a keeper."
1458120,25885,2010-02-23,5,"So delicious and moist!  I used whole wheat flour, chopped walnuts, and EVOO and unsweetened applesauce instead of butter and it was incredible.  I wasn't sure the recipe would be versatile but it tastes so good and besides the high sugar content it is healthy as far as desserts.  This recipe is a keeper.  And it really is quite easy to make.

Update: Reduced sugar from 3/4 cup to 1/2 and tastes great.  Also made as muffins.  A favorite."
242484,25885,2010-02-25,5,Perfect in every sense of the word!
983307,25885,2010-02-26,5,Perfecto!  Wonderful banana bread.  Thank you for sharing.
670089,25885,2010-02-27,5,"Sooo good!  I only had 1 3/4 cups of bananas, but the bread still came out perfect.  Super moist, smells heavenly and the taste makes your heart melt.  My 10-yr-old helped make this, is on his second slice of the bread and said that this can go into our breakfast repertoire.  I think I'll make another loaf with some walnuts and see if I can freeze it.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you for sharing."
1324240,25885,2010-03-01,5,"Have been saving my black bananas in the freezer for a few months and used them to make this, thank you Shelley this was the softest, moistest, best banana bread ever delish!!"
221351,25885,2010-03-13,5,"I absolutely love this. I didn't have enough banana so I halved all measurments and it worked great still.I used ghee(clarified butter)as i didn't have unsalted butter. I used 1/2 wholemeal flour and 1/2 plain white flour.I also added some chopped walnuts which we love. the result was magical especially eaten warm on cold winter days. thank you so much for this recipe. An update, I tried this again with canola oil and 2T vinegar to replace eggs for a vegan version and it still turned out great."
358905,25885,2010-03-15,5,"this is so good!  i usually modify it quite a bit to be ""healthier,"" but either way we really like it.  my modifications are... doing 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 c butter, 1/3 cup applesauce, 1 large egg and 1 egg white, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 overripe medium banana's mashed, and 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips.  baking soda and sugar stay the same.  it works great to bake it in a bundt pan for 40-45 minutes."
198998,25885,2010-03-18,5,I've been making this now for at least a year and I love it!  I use 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of regular (I don't notice a difference in taste).  I also add some cloves (occasionally chocolate chips and cinnamon too).  Thanks!
848071,25885,2010-03-20,5,"This recipe was Easy and came out perfectly. I had 4 large, very over-ripe bananas that I didn't want to throw out.  I had the ingredients to make this, plus another not so ripe banana, and a large pinch of cinamon.  80 mins in the oven. Definitely deserves 5 stars."
138550,25885,2010-03-21,4,"I get funny looks when I tell people that it's ""Banana Banana Bread,"" but that's exactly what it is!  I used six medium bananas total when I made the bread, half of them from the freezer.  The bread is very, very moist, and the banana-flavor is marvelously pronounced.  It's not a great slicing bread, but I think it'd work well as muffins.  I hope to make again when I collect enough overripe bananas."
346497,25885,2011-02-03,2,"WARNING - DOES NOT FREEZE WELL!<br/>Turns to goo.<br/>Made two, and the one we didn't freeze was alright. Too moist (pudding-ish) for my liking. Then we froze one. Yikes. It was completely gooey in the centre. Even tried to stick in back in the oven for another 1/2 hour and it did nothing.<br/>Will go back to my usual recipe."
1136448,25885,2010-03-22,5,"This was wonderful.  I think I solved the problem of the extended cooking times so many reviewers spoke about.  After all the ingredients were mixed, I allowed the batter to sit for 15 minutes before putting in the pan for baking.  I did this originally to allow the banana flavor time to flow throughout the other ingredients.  The batter seemed to be fluffy and light after this resting period and in fact some gas bubbles were forming.  The end result was a loaf which rose above the pan ledge by a good inch and a half.  It was light, moist and cooked through.  Another hint is to cool the bread laying on its side.
Thanks, Shelley"
1445040,25885,2010-03-23,5,"This turned out very good. I added 2 tsps of cinnamon and a half tsp of clove and nutmeg. I also put the butter, eggs, and bananas in the blender. This is a trick I learned from my grandmother and it saves a lot of banana-mashing time. It also makes it lighter since it adds some air. Leaving it out for 15 minutes before baking also helped alot."
1451572,25885,2010-03-29,1,"I was a little disappointed with this recipe after reading so many raving reviews. I guess maybe I had my expectations a little too high. I followed the recipe exactly and used 5 large black, bananas and cooked for exactly the recommended time but it came out dry and tasteless. I have an amazing recipe that I have used for years and wish i had just stuck to that. I wont be making this again."
456732,25885,2010-04-05,5,Very good recipe...I made batter into muffins.
1576165,25885,2010-04-08,4,"Very easy, very tasty- I added a dash of cinnamon and a bit of pure maple syrup as well. YUM- thanks!"
239618,25885,2010-04-23,5,outstandingly awesome. My family loved these. I added a bag of mini chocolate chips to a batch and another time added a bag of peanut butter and milk chocolate chips. Both times were great. Thank you for a perfect recipe. I will go to this recipe often.
252084,25885,2010-04-25,4,"Marvelous.   I changed nothing except that I made muffins (using paper liners for ease of removal).  Check with toothpick after 18 mins, may take a bit longer."
839492,25885,2010-05-01,5,"Moist and delicious. Made in a bundt pan per recommendations, came out beautifully! I also added 2t. of cinnamon, 1/2 t.nutmeg and 1 1/2 t. vanilla extract as I enjoy spiced quick breads. I agree, it's very sweet, all that ripe banana combined with the 3/4c. brown sugar contributes to its sweetness. Update: I made this into muffins, they're so moist & delicious."
1604143,25885,2010-05-01,4,"Very moist and tasty! I left it in for 55 minutes and it was done.  If made again, I'd reduce or replace some of the butter - it's a little too oily for my taste."
100811,25885,2010-05-11,5,Made for the lunch room tomorrow. Added about 1/4 cup shredded coconut and 1 teaspoon of rum extract.
839719,25885,2010-05-13,5,"This is the best tasting banana bread I have ever had (sorry Mom!) I had an extra third cup of mashed banana, so that went in too, so the loaf is a little shorter and more dense than its probably supposed to be, but it tastes like banana heaven. I am soooo satisfied."
333017,25885,2010-05-16,5,This was a very nice tasting banana bread.  I had used frozen bananas that were collecting in my freezer...so that was a bonus.  I used this recipe in Sweet Jezebel's Recipe #409805 and it was devine!!  I would truly recommend both recipes.  Thanks for the posting!!!
510824,25885,2010-05-25,4,"This recipe was very simple, but very delicious! It was easy to make from scratch, beats making the box stuff any day."
64295,25885,2010-05-30,5,"The riper the bananas, the better these are. After making this several times, I measured carefully, so I can report the ingredients called for make a loaf as described AND about 8 muffins to boot. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to the banana-egg mixture before adding to the dry ingredients. Fill the loaf pan (muffin cups) about 3/4 of the way. This is incredible stuff."
491095,25885,2010-06-01,5,"Delish. I did take a reviewers advice and baked mine in a bundt and added cinnamon, turned out perfect. It still had a pudding like texture even after over 50 minutes of baking but I really enjoyed the recipe overall. Thanks!"
38025,25885,2010-06-13,5,"For a really extra special treat, once you pour the dough/mix into the pans, sprinkle some brown sugar and/or chopped nuts on top. It's personal preference which decides how much you add. I guarantee you'll NOT be sorry."
1029096,25885,2010-06-13,4,"This was good made in the bundt pan and topped with some vanilla buttercream frosting.  I added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to the recipe as suggested by other reviewers.  The bread (cake) was more dense than I anticipated."
1609335,25885,2010-06-30,5,"This was very moist. I made it in a bundt pan and cooked it for 40 minutes. I added the 2t of cinnamon, 1/2t of nutmeg, 1t of vanilla, and sprinked the top with brown sugar and chopped pecans as others suggested. I will make this again."
1345244,25885,2010-07-14,5,I added walnuts and a bit of cinnamon to the mixture which I doubled.  I had it on the top rack and took them out after about 55 minutes.  It came out perfectly.  Very yummy and moist.
1527940,25885,2010-07-16,5,"I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe. I found your posting back in May, we love this recipe.Easy to make and full of flavor. Thanks for posting."
1508658,25885,2011-02-12,4,"Really good, not too sweet like some other banana breads. Watch your cooking time as the middle sometimes is not done all the way."
1381618,25885,2010-07-17,1,"I have my own banana bread recipe that I always make, but I decided to do something different and found this recipe... I read all the reviews and thought it'd come out better than my other recipe, but my husband and I aren't liking this one too much. It's not... the right texture that we like, and the flavor is a little different. Could be the butter or brown sugar (my other recipe calls for oil and granulated sugar), who knows, but others love this recipe, so it could also just be us. I do know that I love baking the brown sugar on top, that I'll add to my other recipe for sure. Thanks for sharing."
594755,25885,2010-07-20,5,Easy and comes out great. Thank you for posting!!
1657681,25885,2010-07-31,3,"Texture-wise and colour-wise, this was awesome.  It has a lot of banana flavour, which of course is desired.  My only complaint is that it is noticeably missing the flavours other than banana.  Next time I will add about 2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg.  Nevertheless, it was very tasty and definitely won't go uneaten in my house!  Thank you."
282079,25885,2010-09-13,0,This is a great recipe!  I used only 3 bananas which made is less flavorful...but the texture was awesome.  I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cups walnuts!  nice and rich and a little chocolate and nuts never hurt anyone!  next time I would definitely add more bananas for a real banana flavor!
51931,25885,2010-09-18,5,"This was a super easy recipe. Prep time was a cinch, as was clean-up.  I added some vanilla extract per one of the reviews.  I normally add walnuts to my bread, but b/c of a tree nut allergy in the house, I had to come up with something else to add.  I added about a cup of fresh blueberries and some dried cranberries to the batter.  What a wonderful addition. Next time I'll add more blueberries as I loved the flavor it added. I used 5 very ripe banana's and the bread was super moist.  I had enough batter left over to make 6 muffins in addition to the loaf.  I'd like to reduce the butter next time also and replace it wtih applesauce and add some chopped up apples to the batter as well. This is a keeper.  Thanks!"
376704,25885,2010-09-21,3,"I'm pretty confused, because EVERYONE says how moist this is. Mine was dry - I followed the recipte to the letter....I made a double batch & put walnuts & chocolate chips in one loaf. Regardless, I'll probably go on back to you normal recipe."
558979,25885,2010-09-23,5,"Decided to try this one instead of my usual recipe (my mom's), LOVED it!  The brown sugar is what makes it so yummy in my mind, kind of a sticky, caramel-y crust on top.  The kids and my husband all loved it too and they don't usually eat the other recipe.  I didn't think I would ever replace the old stand-by recipe but this might just do it : )"
1725569,25885,2010-11-09,1,"Followed instructuions, too heavy and it is lacking flavor.  Needs vanilla and a int of cinnamon.<br/>No one cared for it."
1710138,25885,2010-11-09,1,"felt like a 7 lb loaf.  Was wet in the center and the ouyter edges were burnt.<br/>I won't make this again,"
242578,25885,2010-11-30,5,Absolutely great tasting Banana Bread!!! I ended up using up to 5 ripe bananas. I have a feeling I am going to purposefully ripe the bananas instead of eating them so I can make this bread again & again! Toasted slice tastes amazing! Next time may be I will add walnuts. Thank you so much for sharing :)
383346,25885,2010-12-02,5,This is a great bread.  I used margarine instead of butter.  I added 20 minutes to the cooking time.  Thanks Shelley :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
1764470,25885,2010-12-19,5,This has been my standby banana bread recipe for years - just love it!
378702,25885,2010-12-23,5,I made these for my husband and children since I do not eat banana bread. They love it and it's very moist/well put together. I'm baking challenged but this loaf came out perfect. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and used all whole wheat flour. Thanks!
104082,25885,2010-12-27,0,"I was very impressed with this banana bread!....I was just a bit shy of the required amount of mashed banana ( I had only 2 cups) ,but it turned out great anyway!....My kids loved it and couldn't get enough and ended up arguing over who was going to get the last piece...I won*lol*.....Very moist and flavourful!!"
106608,25885,2011-01-21,5,This recipe turns out moist banana bread. I do add walnut halves to the batter. Thanks for a great recipe!
622153,25885,2011-01-24,5,"Yummy!! Best banana bread recipe I have ever made, I`m not usually a fan of banana bread but make it for the kids and this hands down made me a fan of banana bread. It rose so nice, it had an awesome crust (which is my faveorite part), and moist and flavourful. I did add some vanilla and cinnamon, but would taste great without also I`m sure."
1587113,25885,2011-01-25,5,"I made this as a cake, and sandwiched it with butterscotch sauce and whipped cream... and it was fabulous! I took other reviews' advice and added some cinnamon and vanilla and it was great!"
234979,25885,2011-02-01,5,"I've been making this for years now.  I bought a bundt pan just for this recipe.  A double recipe will fill a bundt pan and a loaf pan. It's wonderfully flexible.  You can dress it up or dress it down.  Make it healthy with whole wheat flour, coconut oil and pumpkin seeds.  Or add blueberries or chocolate chips.  Make a sugar glaze to drizzle over top.  No matter what you do It never fails.  It's hands down the best banana bread ever.  Wish I could give it 10 stars."
1260683,25885,2011-03-01,5,"delicious!  i made one loaf and saved some batter to make a dozen cupcakes as well.  fantastic flavor, and easy to make.  i also added pecans and a few chocolate chips.  my hubby and 2 kids love love love them!!"
632718,25885,2011-03-21,5,"This banana bread was fantastic. I waited until the bananas were brown. I didn't have brown sugar so I substituted white sugar and molasses, frickin fantastic. Best banana bread recipe ever."
268061,25885,2011-03-23,5,great banana bread wonderful flavor very moist thanks i will be making this again
1173570,25885,2011-04-08,0,Delicious moist and not too sweet!   Thanks!
1882865,25885,2011-04-19,2,My bread tasted strongly of baking soda. You might want to use less than the recipe calls for.
709700,25885,2011-04-30,0,This was great!  Easy to make and moist.
264012,25885,2011-05-07,5,"I'm am suprised at myself that I have never rated this recipe! This is the only banana bread recipe that I have used for at least 2 years. I love it! I love to make it into muffins or just bread. I sometimes use coursely chopped nuts which make it even more wonderful, but it is wonderful as is. Thanks so much for posting. I love this bread."
547187,25885,2011-05-15,1,"I never like giving negative feedback, but I wanted to rate if for those (like me) who would flock to it based on the number of reviews. This is next to horrible. Banana bread is a staple in our house; I buy bananas just so they will over ripen and I can bake it, and am always looking for a new reicipe to try. I followed the recipe to the T. Dry, very flat in flavor. Everyone was disappointed. I would pass on this one."
1918218,25885,2011-05-27,5,"Made this last night and it was lovely, although I did add chocolate chips"
91392,25885,2011-05-27,5,"Very good, very easy and almost identical to my grandmother's recipe."
133174,25885,2011-06-07,5,This was made as  per recipe.  With all the bananass the bread was super mosit and even right out of the oven the bread was very flavorful.  I did add in some chopped pecans.  Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe.
1242099,25885,2011-06-20,4,Very good recipe... actually this is the first time I made banana bread.  I used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  It tasted great and is a fairly healthy snack for kids.  I'll try all whole wheat next time.  We used 5 bananas which was about exactly 2 1/3 cups.  I'll try adding nuts or chocolate chips for my kids.
41790,25885,2011-07-09,5,"So, as always...1.  I can never leave anything alone, and 2.  I always start cooking thinking that I have what I need and then realize halfway through that I don't.  So.....I added a 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tbsp. cinnamon, and 1 tsp. ginger to the wet mixture.  Then realizing I only had half the volume of bananas I needed, I chopped up som peaches that I had that were going soft.  Ridiculous.  Amazing.  I love it when that happens and it turns out great, but would not have been able to get there without you!"
1670868,25885,2011-07-12,0,Wonderful recipe! I added a tsp of vanilla and one of nutmeg and cinnamon as well as half a cup of chopped walnuts. The outside was dark brown but the inside was soft and chewy with the nuts. Perfect!
953796,25885,2011-07-15,1,i baked it for half the time and was still very dry and bland.. definatly wouldnt make this reciepe again.. sorry :(
960396,25885,2011-07-22,4,Simple but delicious! I only used four bananas because that's what I had and I added some cinnamon. Yummy. I will try again with five.
313943,25885,2011-08-02,5,"Moist, delicious, perfect!"
369284,25885,2011-08-06,5,Chiming in to say that this is the recipe I keep coming back to for banana bread. :) Love it. Occasionally add one tsp. vanilla. ;)
212460,25885,2011-08-06,5,"My first banana bread recipe. It came out absolutely perfect.  I used whole wheat flour, dark unrefined muscovado sugar, and my 5 freezer-ripened bananas came to around 2cups. Baked for 50mins.  Will use this recipe again for sure."
1400280,25885,2011-09-12,5,"I made this recipe as muffins last week and brought them to my art students in a local juvenile detention centre.  They have named the muffins:  Heart Mender Muffins.  As in....""Those muffins mended every hole in my heart"".  If I could give more than 5 stars as muffins, I would."
1917446,25885,2011-09-13,4,"Amazing! I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Made a topping with 2 tsp butter, 1 tbs brown sugar and 1/3 c. pecans crunched up together and put it on before baking. It turns out more like banana cake but so effing good!"
960625,25885,2011-09-17,5,"Prepared with a couple additions. I HAVE to have cinnamon in my banana bread so I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I was making this for our church snack with coffee between Sunday school and church services, so instead of a loaf I make mini muffins. It made 42 muffins and I baked them for 20 minutes. They came out perfect. I had 5 requests for the recipe even before church services started."
242846,25885,2011-09-17,5,very yummy...........  thanks for posting.  will deffinately make this again
657197,25885,2011-09-20,4,"this was really good. I made them into muffins since I didn't have my loaf pan.  they were done in 15-20 min.  It made 12 muffins.  They were very banana-y, and not too sweet.  I would like to try again with some cinnamon to give it a little more flavor.  Great recipe- and really simple.  It's a keeper. thanks!"
689797,25885,2011-09-22,0,"I made it using Bread Flour, then followed the recipe to the T-ee.<br/>Best Banana bread I've ever made."
28604,25885,2011-09-24,5,Fabulous! Thanks for posting!
267853,25885,2011-10-31,5,Excellent recipe!  I used 3 very overripe bananas and also threw in about 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  My only complaint was all the dishes that the recipe uses!
857854,25885,2011-11-11,5,"Very good recipe!  I did use wheat flour and added some chopped almonds.  <br/><br/>I see some complaints about the 3 bowls - I only used one bowl.  I tilted the bowl of mashed bananas and creamed the butter into the sugar on the side, then tilted again to the other side to crack in the eggs and beat them before stirring them into the banana... I poured the flour on top of the wet mixture and mixed in the baking soda and salt before stirring it into the wet stuff.  Still turned out great!"
460705,25885,2011-11-21,5,"This is very close to the recipe Ive used for years. I have a few tips. I use one bowl only.  I store any over-ripe bananas in the freezer, so I always have a generous supply, and when they thaw they are almost liquid (no mashing needed) and FULL of intense banana flavor. I use 4 medium bananas and add them to the creamed butter and sugar. I also add a 1/2 tsp of baking powder. After pouring batter into loaf pan I sprinkle the top with course sugar and bake. The course sugar gives the top a great crunch. Great recipe!!"
1652999,25885,2011-11-25,5,"Wonderfully moist. Took suggestions and added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg & baking powder. I used 2 bananas in a small loaf pan. Went over great with my friends!"
2038463,25885,2011-11-30,0,"This was great! I have made this twice in one week, the first time I stuck to the recipe. The second time I followed the reviews and added 1 tsp of vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 cup chopped walnuts, and sprinkled brown sugar and chopped walnuts on the top of the loaf too. I had better luck with even cooking in my glass loaf pan, and I had to cook it for an hour and a half but it is well worth the wait."
1716736,25885,2011-12-19,0,Great banana bread! It smelled wonderful cooking. It even tempted my husband who is not a banana bread fan.
1223283,25885,2011-12-28,5,Best banana bread ever! I put chocolate chips on top for mine and filled it with walnuts for a friend's favorite version! Works perfectly everytime. I throw my bananas in the freezer and then they come out of their skin so easily once defrosted!
1402571,25885,2012-01-08,5,"These are incredible! They%u2019re super moist and full of flavor. On a whim, I added 1/2 c. chocolate chips and baked in mini muffin tin 20 minutes. I guessed at 5 bananas and it worked perfectly. Using the brown sugar instead of white is an excellent idea! I will most certainly bake these again!!"
1147148,25885,2012-01-14,0,super amazing!!!
2150630,25885,2012-01-17,5,"I don't bake...ever.  Unless it comes from a box.  However, I had an excess of bananas and thought I would give it a go.  I am so glad that I did.  Super moist, tasty and the banana flavor is superb.  I have saved this recipe on my paprika app and will make this in the future....again and again and again and again and again.  So very happy to have found this recipe."
265956,25885,2012-01-18,5,I have been using your recipe for years and just noticed I haven't reviewed it until now. This is my go to recipe and my WHOLE family loves it! I sometimes mix it up and add a cup of oatmeal and a tsp of cinnamon to make a breakfast muffin. I have a batch in the oven right now and my house smells heavenly.
1762279,25885,2012-02-18,5,My family loved these!  I made them into muffins and mini muffins for lunches and added mini chocolate chips :)  I always have very ripe bananas that no one will eat and it seemed 5 were the perfect amount for this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!
148490,25885,2012-02-20,5,The best banana bread recipe I have ever found. So moist and full of banana flavor - perfect for buying that huge bag of over ripe bananas at the store. I made muffins with this recipe and baked about 18 minutes at 350. PERFECT!!!
637765,25885,2012-02-23,5,"For serious banana lovers, for sure!"
132764,25885,2012-03-11,4,"This was really good! I added a tsp of baking powder, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will make this again."
184986,25885,2012-03-11,5,"Very moist, delicious bread."
707337,25885,2012-04-07,4,"This bread was okay.  It wasn't as sweet as we like, and well, it was just okay.  I'm sorry, I know everyone else raved about this recipe, but I found it lacked some sweetness...also, I didn't realize until after I had it in the oven that it didn't even call for vanilla.  I think if I were to make this recipe again, I would use 1 c. white sugar and add 1 tsp. of vanilla.  HOWEVER, thank you very much for posting your recipe!"
1677099,25885,2012-05-05,5,"Made 7 of these for a bake sale using pans that equal about 2 - 2.5 regular size muffins.  I added Cinnamon and ginger.  Replaced butter with canola.  The outside forms a bit of a ""crust"" and the inside are moist and lovely."
137302,25885,2012-05-09,0,"I used this recipe to teach my 10 yr old DGD how to bake.  She did all the mixing, measuring, and baking.  I just stood by and gave her specific instructions for each step given.  She did a wonderful job and I am proud of her.  This banana bread was very good.  I personally look like the bread if it were a little bit sweeter since I enjoy banana bread that way the best.  Next time I will increase the brown sugar to 1 cup instead of the 3/4 cup listed.  I'm not penalizing the chef for my desire to have it be sweeter since that is a personal choice...especially since everything else about the recipe is perfect."
1298077,25885,2012-10-06,3,"I liked this banana bread okay, but it wasn't exceptional.  I had 4 ripe bananas.  It was moist inside with a crunchy crust.  I honestly think my disappointment is somehow in using all brown sugar instead of a mix or all-white.  Good bread, just not for my taste to make again."
527016,25885,2012-05-12,5,"I thawed frozen, over-ripe bananas today (other days I've used a combo of frozen and regular, microwaved a bit) In the past, I've used 1/2 reg. and 1/2 whole wheat flour; after today's trial I think I like that better.  I added 1t of vanilla, some cinnamon and nutmeg and I might increase that a bit next time.  I don't ever remember a chunk of the loaf sticking to the pan like it did for me tonight :( I think I must have had a mis-step along the way...but it didn't affect the yummy flavor!"
1581225,25885,2012-06-14,5,Delicious. I've made this several times. It's my favourite recipe to use up over-ripe bananas. Thanks!
261646,25885,2012-06-18,5,"Love it love it love it!!!!!!!! have made this many times (just getting around to reviewing it), and my family thinks its great! have halved and doubled it, with great results.I have averaged 6 bananas for the 2 & 1/3 cups called for, and the recipe is beautifully moist.<br/> The *only* problem that i have had is that when I have cook it in a traditional loaf pan, 60-65 mins isn't done. I have gotten around that by dropping the temperature to 325,so the top doesn't burn and leaving it in for approximately another 30 mins ( average 90 mins total ).. <br/> But my preferance is to just use my mini-loaf pans :) A full recipe fits 6 mini loafs just right, and they are all cooked through and beautifully golden brown in about 50-60 mins ( depends on how often our 12 y/o opens the door, lol ). Muffin tins work well.. i think i had 20 muffins, last time i did that.<br/> Oh, and the poster was absolutly right - it is GREAT toasted...especially with peanut butter. <br/>Thanks for posting!<br/>ETA: five years later, *still* the best banana bread recipe that I have found, and I keep trying new ones."
1221917,25885,2012-06-23,5,"This is a fabulous recipe! I baked mine in muffin tins at a slightly lower temperature, and they did not even last 24 hours before everyone in my family had gobbled them up! They are so incredibly moist and flavorful, and so easy to prepare!"
59199,25885,2012-07-01,4,Very moist and tasty! It could probably be a little more sweet for my taste but it was still very good. My guests ate nearly the entire thing over the course of the day! I only needed to bake about 30 min.
321172,25885,2012-07-02,5,"I've made this several times now and it always comes out perfect. <br/>Let me start by telling you -- I am a former banana bread hater. The consistancy was just not for me. I'm one of those people that will eat to be polite, so I've tried a few BB in my time, all of which did not do it for me. That is UNTIL I made this for my family. I needed to do something with bananas-gone-ripe and my hubby loves banana bread. I tasted it and lo and behold LOVED IT!!! Yes, it's moist, but not gooey. I don't know what's so different about how this is prepared, it's the only recipe I've personally prepared, but the bananas blend seamlessly into the mixture and you just don't get those gooey bites other recipes tend to leave. <br/>This gets 5 stars for converting me!"
84364,25885,2012-07-22,5,"Wonderful and oh so easy!  Have made this several times and it's always wonderful1  Made exactly as the recipe says but sprinkled brown sugar on top of batter before baking.  Sometimes I add pecans because I like em and other times no nuts because hubby does not like them, same thing with raisins!  If we want a sweeter bread, while it's still hot, I poke holes in the top with a fork and drizzle a powdered sugar/milk glaze.  Have taken it to work many times to share for breakfast and it is gone in a flash!  This is definitely a keeper in my recipe file!"
545970,25885,2012-08-09,4,A really good banana bread.  I would use this recipe again but next time I would cook for 65 minutes (did only 60 this time) and add some walnuts for a contrasting texture.  5 bananas worked for me!
157167,25885,2012-08-18,5,I had 2 bananas so I made a half batch - delicious!  It baked a little quicker as it was only half as big.
2007679,25885,2012-08-19,5,"Awesome awesome awesome.  I'm making this for the second time this week.  <br/><br/>As some others suggested, I added a little bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, and used half whole wheat flour as well."
97579,25885,2012-08-27,5,Just took this out of the oven and it is delicious!  I did lay foil over it to prevent it from browning as my oven does have a tendency to do that.  It took about 50 minutes to cook.  Excellent!!!
1517744,25885,2012-08-28,5,"Our family loves banana bread and this is our new go-to recipe.  I add about 1 tsp of cinnamon, but otherwise make as directed.  Love it!"
1968112,25885,2012-09-05,5,"Wonderful!I had 1 cup less bananas,so I made up with some milk.Very tasty,moist,not too sweet..I made it a couple of hours ago, and three quarters of it is gone already!I used some overripe bananas that I had frozen ."
482376,25885,2012-09-23,4,"Very good banana bread. The banana is definitely the star here, as it should be! I loved that it was so easy to put together. I checked mine after 55 minutes and it was just staring to get too well done. It probably could have been pulled out after 50 minutes. Thanks for posting this yummy, easy recipe! Made for the I Recommend Tag in the Cooking Tag Games forums."
1904848,25885,2012-09-24,5,"Awesome recipe, I only put in 2 cups of bananas because that is all I had, Next time I will for sure use the whole amount, Very easy to make as well, First time I have baked from scratch and I will be making this more often for sure. Thank you for a go to banana bread recipe :)"
42413,25885,2012-09-30,4,"Very dense and delicious!  I added some vanilla and mini chocolate chips (as per my daughter's request), but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!"
2444273,25885,2012-10-10,5,"A great ""basic"" recipe that is easy to make additions. I've done this several times adding a bag of mini chocolate chips - always excellent. I've also tried adding 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a half bag of peanut butter chips - also came out excellent! There's really no way you can go wrong with this one."
1560358,25885,2012-10-14,5,"This is one of the best recipes involving baking that I've ever seen.  I didn't want a ton of banana bread, just enough for one person, so I halved the recipe.  Sometimes when you do that, things don't turn out quite right.  However, with this one, I felt like nothing could go wrong.  Like another reviewer did, I added a bit of cinnamon in the batter.  I don't even think that it needs vanilla.  Unfortunately, there wasn't enough brown sugar in my cupboard.  I added a bit more white sugar.  That didn't take anything away from the wonderful flavor.<br/><br/>For those who are concerned about their bananas being ""overly ripe,"" I would just make sure to mash the bananas well so that they really mix into the batter.  If the batter is nice and gooey, the bread should come out moist.  <br/><br/>I left it in for about an hour, so that time worked well for me.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again soon!"
529949,25885,2012-10-26,5,"I followed the recipe exactly, except I added chopped walnuts. I left it in the oven for 65 minutes, and it turned out perfect. It was moist on the inside, and crunchy on the outside. I let it cool, and it sliced perfectly. Packed it in plastic bags and took it camping. Yummy."
14327,25885,2012-10-31,5,WOW!!! This is one of the best banana bread recipes ever! I adjusted the cooking time down to 45-50 min and it came out perfect. Thanks for sharing! I will be using this recipe for years to come.
1974537,25885,2012-11-04,5,"Thanks a lot!!!! I now have to make this every week or my family gets mad!  This is over the top easy and oh, so good.  I always add chocolate chips.  Thanks for a ridiculously awesome recipe :)"
857805,25885,2012-11-07,5,"Delicious! I added a little vanilla & didn't really measure the bananas, just used 4. Chewy outside, moist center!"
1403127,25885,2012-12-04,5,"I can see why this recipe got so many strong reviews with 5 stars.  This is so moist and good.  I will add the vanilla next time, per the suggestion of another baker on this site.  As it stands this is my new favorite banana bread recipe!  Thanks for sharing!"
1794330,25885,2012-12-05,4,"If you want the most moist banana bread ever - this is the recipe for you! The bread is so moist you can literally hear a spongy sound as you bite into it! The flavor is good and I liked how it had a decent rise on it instead of being heavy like some banana bread recipes do when there's lots of banana. I actually might enjoy this just a tad drier, however. I personally don't like my bread to get too mushy in my mouth before I'm done chewing it! I will have to try toasting it!"
251626,25885,2012-12-30,4,Good
411647,25885,2013-02-03,4,Turned out really well.  I embellished with some cinnamon and chocolate chips for fun.  Moist and stayed moist through the week.
2476736,25885,2013-02-14,4,"This is very good, I mix the ingredients in a bowl starting with the dry ingredients and then poured it into my bread maker set it on basic bread and left. When I got home it was cooked to perfection! 
I think next time I will oven roast some pecans (400 degrees for 10 minutes or so) and add cinnamon and nutmeg. I will definitely make this again."
1734160,25885,2013-02-27,1,"Mine didn't come out moist, it came out kind of hard and tasteless...not sure what I did wrong, I followed all the directions. :("
1249396,25885,2013-02-28,4,"Made this exactly as written but added dark chocolate chips and I'm glad I did! I'm funny when it comes to bananas. I like green bananas and banana bread but not banana pudding so much. I cooked this as directed, the toothpick came out clean, the crust was beautifully browned and I love hot banana bread. I sliced it and when I went to pull it out of the pan the batter was still oozing a lot. I put it back in the oven covered with foil for 15 more minutes. This time it was still Very moist but delicious. I don't think I would like this as much without the chocolate chips though."
448004,25885,2013-03-28,5,"This is nice and moist, I put it in a cupcake pan for nice individual sizes.  I will make this again! Edited: I have made this more times than I can think of, it turns out GREAT every time!! LOVE this banana bread!"
1663799,25885,2013-04-12,5,OMG this was the best banana bread recipe ever!! the only thing was I added walnuts and chocolate chips because they were on hand..like others who reviewed i thought i burnt it because the top was darker brown..but NO it came out so perfect.. moist and delish.. and best yet DH who hates all things banana is eating this bread as I am typing this.. who know that this one simple recipe would bring a non sweet eater back for more!!!.. cant wait to toast it in the morning slathered in butter.. I will have happy dreams tonight&lt;br/&gt;thank you Shelley for posting this recipe!!
94996,25885,2013-04-14,5,"I finally found it! This will be MY banana bread recipe. So moist and yummy. I had about six bananas in my freezer, but it wasn&#039;t enough. Really glad someone suggested using pumpkin to make up the difference. It does not change the taste."
1390136,25885,2013-04-18,0,Yuck! NO flavor at all. Tender and moist but is wallpaper paste.
195727,25885,2013-04-19,4,"This was good banana bread :) It was extremely moist. I would suggest really &quot;beating&quot; the eggs as we had a couple eggy bites but i just stirred the eggs up with a fork. The other thing was if you dont like chunks of banana, really smash it up good too...no dime sized pieces. Mine was ready in 55 minutes.*2nd time I added vanilla"
2805696,25885,2013-04-29,5,This was my first time making banana bread. I did add some cinnamon and vanilla. I also used brown and white sugar. I made 14 mini loaves. It took about 20 minutes to bake. It came out soooooooo good!!!! Will make this recipe again. Oh yeah I forgot to thank my little helper Meleana.
328467,25885,2013-04-30,5,"Perfection.  Dense, moist, no cracks on the top, super banana-y flavor.  I added cinnamon and vanilla, and I used 1/2 cup plain yogurt instead of butter.  I mixed everything together in one bowl.  Even my picky boyfriend gobbled this up. I&#039;ll be making this again and again.  TIP:  For intense banana flavor let bananas blacken on the counter top then freeze them (don&#039;t peel them).  Even if you don&#039;t let them blacken, be sure to freeze them.  Once defrosted they have intense banana flavor."
64642,25885,2013-05-27,5,"Terrific banana bread recipe...no frills, just great banana flavor.  I&#039;ve made this recipe several times.  Sometimes as written, sometimes with half whole wheat/half AP flour, sometimes all whole wheat.  It&#039;s good all kinds of ways!  :-)"
2824208,25885,2013-06-19,5,"Very easy recipe yet tasty bread. It&#039;s moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside and I love my breads that way. I&#039;ve always been a fan of Banana Bread since a kid but never got the chance to make one. Now that I&#039;ve finally learned on how to, I&#039;ve been making at least one loaf a week :P Thanks for the wonderful recipe! xxx"
2864101,25885,2013-06-23,5,"This was a very simple easy recipe !! I let it cook for about 55 minutes , so moist one of the best recipes yet hands down."
2788931,25885,2013-07-09,5,Its the BEST banana bread ever. I didn&#039;t like banana bread until I tried this one. Now I love it. I make it all the time. My fiance loves it. If I don&#039;t watch him he would eat the whole loaf of bread by himself lol.... I made only one chance in this recipe. I add 1table spoon of cinnamon. I just love cinnamon and it taste amazing in this banana bread ....
566255,25885,2013-07-27,5,Quick and easy!  I&#039;ll be making this on a regular now! &lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing! = )
2936504,25885,2013-08-08,5,This is the first time making this recipe.  It was very tasty but I had to bake it for approximately 80 minutes for the center to be done.  Still a moist bread.  The center did puff up and split a lot.  Did not make any substitutions.  Used a 9 X5X4 thick glass baking dish.
41817282,25885,2013-08-31,4,Followed recipe exactly. This was a moist and a very good banana bread. It was simply with much flavor
300721,25885,2013-09-22,5,"Have chosen this as our go-to Banana Bread.  I have made what must be hundreds of different recipes over the years, and my Banana Bread loving son has named this the best.  Of course I put much more banana than the recipe calls for, and it is delicious!!&lt;br/&gt;Helpful hint:  This may be a no-brainer and what everyone does, but as bananas get over-ripe at my house I put them in the freezer.  This way any time I feel like making banana bread, I usually have enough.  Just thaw, or defrost in the micro, and go!"
293757,25885,2013-10-10,5,"Excellent recipe, forgot to add my rating on last review, so had to give credit where credit is due.  THe best banana bread recipe I have found thus far.  Thanks again for the yummy post"
1451716,25885,2013-10-31,2,Definitely not my style of banana bread.  It was more of a bread pudding consistency.
725130,25885,2013-11-09,5,"Wonderful banana bread! My kids love it, especially when I put some chocolate chips in it :)"
2499969,25885,2013-11-10,5,Quick cheap and easy.  The first one my husband actually loved :)
1169750,25885,2013-11-20,3,"This was just OK.  Definitely not sweet enough.  Fortunately, I put some broken-up chocolate baking bar and that saved it."
1076345,25885,2013-12-03,4,This banana bread was very tasty. It was definitely more the consistency of a bread pudding and I normally like my banana bread to have a more cake like texture. It was almost too moist for my preference. All that said I still enjoyed it with a glass of cold milk!
2000067660,25885,2015-07-12,5,I have been using this recipe for along time. Never had a bad loaf. I didnt change a thing. Everyone loves it.
1800284404,25885,2013-12-17,5,The BEST EVER!!!! This will now be the official recipe in my home for Banana Bread. This is the first time that I have made banana bread and the center was fully cooked. Followed the recipe ( omitted salt because I used salted butter) and it turned out great. My husband knew this was a recipe I that I could not make and he rushed thru dinner so that he could sample the banana bread. He can&#039;t stop eating it. This is a winner in my home!!!!
481092,25885,2014-01-03,5,Good. I added vanilla and used four bananas.
1800063750,25885,2014-01-28,4,This banana bread has a good flavor. My bread came out a little darker than I would like but I will try this recipe again.
13796,25885,2014-03-09,5,"Very delicious bread. I am making a third time today and have decided to add nuts, vanilla and a little spice to it."
1802545903,25885,2014-03-12,4,Moist n yummy!
704166,25885,2014-03-16,5,"So good, I had to hunt it down again!  I added a ts of vanilla, and a dash of nutmeg.  I also browned my bananas in the oven - 300 for an hour."
1662114,25885,2014-05-18,5,Love this recipe!  Fairly simple and so delicious.  I&#039;ve made it three times now. Big hit with my young son.
300600,25885,2014-05-29,5,"This recipe is out of this world, fantastic! I added chopped walnuts. Substituted Splenda brown sugar for my diabetic spouse. At the 40 min. mark I put a tented piece of foil on the top to keep it from getting too brown. At the 55 min. mark I removed the foil. At the 60 min. mark, the bread was done and perfect!"
42904871,25885,2014-06-09,5,Made this to use up old bananas that were over ripened. I cut the recipe in half and it was excellent!
341344,25885,2014-06-16,4,"It came out alright.  The top carmelized to the point of near-burnt at 55 minutes.  Pick that off, it tastes better.  I was worried that if I took it out any sooner, the inside would be goo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moist enough, but lacking in spices in my opinion.  I dusted the top with cinnamon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;d modify, next time.  Add a generous amount of cardamom to the batter as it pairs quite well with banana.  I&#039;d also add nuts of some sort."
1809221,25885,2014-10-12,4,"Great bread!! I actually made them into small muffins, and added a banana slice with peanut butter on the top."
540346,25885,2014-10-27,5,AMAZING!  MOIST!  DELICIOUS!  I used coconut oil in place of butter and I added some mini chocolate chips.  Wonderful!
1802694935,25885,2014-11-11,5,Very Good!!!!!!   I did increase the brown sugar to 1 cup.  Watch your baking time closely.  It`s ease to go over time and burn this.
1955655,25885,2014-12-07,5,My new favorite banana bread recipe.
336145,25885,2014-12-31,5,"I&#039;ve used this recipe many times, often adding a little of this or that.  This time, I added a cup of frozen cranberries, roughly chopped, and a teaspoon of vanilla and one of cinnamon.  Delicious, as always!  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe.  Update:  If anyone is using the mini loaf pans by USA Pans, the cooking time is 30 - 35 minutes for four pans.  This recipe is also on their website."
527182,25885,2015-01-14,2,"Too moist and pudding like.  Looks and tastes undercooked despite how long you cook it.  It worked well in mini pan, not in bread pan size."
2000009553,25885,2015-02-20,1,"I&#039;m sorry, but this was awful! It was very dry and not much flavor. This was actually the worst recipe for banana bread I have ever made. 50 minutes cooking time would have probably been better for the dryness."
126104,25885,2015-03-09,5,"It&#039;s a pretty good darn sign when a recipe receives 860 ratings, and most are positive, that this is a keeper.  This one is no exception.  I had to &quot;bake&quot; the bananas I had, because they were not ripe enough.  This made them squishy and perfect.  I could not wait for the recipe to cool, and I don&#039;t think I gave it enough time, but the first slice was heaven!!!  I put it back in the oven for an extra 10 min. (inside was &quot;oozy&quot;) and that was perfect.  This was dinner last nite, and breakfast this morning.  An absolutely keeper."
2000207136,25885,2015-05-16,5,this is the first time I&#039;ve tried this recipe because of the five star rating on so many people I was optimistic about it. I made it for my fiance and he loves it it is very moist and light and I love it too I will definitely try this recipe again
1628152,25885,2015-08-22,5,"With over 800 reviews,  I doubt mine will make much of a differnce, but here goes: Really good! Best banana bread ever, even with allergy subs: GF Flour, Applesauce (eggs), Coconut oil (butter) and soymilk (milk).  I doubted the recipe  for not adding cinnamon, vanilla or nutmeg but it was SO GOOD without them! Thank you!"
2000445882,25885,2015-09-01,5,"This was a hit!! I made 2 different loafs, one with chocolate chips and one without! Everyone loved it!!??"
876385,25885,2015-09-23,5,"Like others, I need to give this moist and tasty treat its due.   I used 4 bananas (as that is all I had) and didn&#039;t really measure them noting another reviewer said it took 5 bananas to reach the required measurement.     No bad effects with 4.  Taking advice from those who tried it before me, I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a good shake of cinnamon.  This is a moist, dense bread, and I enjoyed the first slice still slightly warm."
2000519559,25885,2015-10-18,5,Just made this and its so AMAZING!! I added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract and chocolate chips. Besides that I followed the recipe exactly. The banana bread didn&#039;t even have a chance to cool down all the way before it was gone. Thanks for this recipe!! :)
2000958545,25885,2016-04-05,5,"Love this recipe! I made a mistake with the ingredients, and hence had to make a few adjustments. I thought I read 4 eggs, or at least that what was I remembered. The good news is, I ended up with more banana bread!

Changes I made:
1 c. Brown Sugar (up from 3/4 c.)
1/2 c. Butter (same as recipe)
4 eggs (the mistake! Up from 2)
1/2 cup milk (addition, since I didn&#039;t have any more bananas)
5 bananas (2 2/3 c, same as recipe)
1 tsp vanilla (addition)
2 3/4 c. Flour (up from 2 c)
1 tbls baking soda
1/2 tsp salt. 

Baked at 350 degrees, in a 7x10 casserole dish, for 70 minutes. 

So, this started out as a mistake, but it turned out perfect!!"
2001095691,25885,2016-07-20,5,I have been making this recipe for my family and friends for the last 4 years. Every time it comes out of the oven I am their hero all over again.
2001090377,25885,2016-08-06,3,Quick and easy but too sweet for me. I will go back to my usual recipe which only has 1/4 cup sugar.
2001345377,25885,2017-01-10,5,Absutely delicious!!! Added 1c chocolate chips. All gone same day!!!
2000501801,25885,2017-01-21,1,Looks Great smells good but don't try to eat it very dry while making it i re checked the recipe a couple of times to make sure that i wasn't missing any thing because the batter seamed dry but there was nothing that i had missed after i pulled it out of the oven i had hope for it as it looked good and smelled really good after it cooled i cut a slice and i think it was the dryest banana bread i have ever had
2001407126,25885,2017-02-26,4,"I have a favorite recipe for banana bread that uses white sugar. Today I wanted to try out a brown sugar recipe. I made this recipe using only 3 bananas. I also made muffins versus a loaf. They came out the perfect color, texture, and moistness. I honestly believe using more than 3 bananas would have compromised those qualities. Overall its a good recipe but I still favor mine better in terms of taste."
474366,25885,2017-06-24,5,"I have been making this banana bread for years, and it is perfect every time. It has come to the point when if we have bananas with a tiny bit of brown on them, my daughter will point them out and say, &quot;time for banana bread!&quot; Amazing, simple, fail-safe recipe."
2001650937,25885,2017-07-31,4,Very moist! But the outside was overdone. Needed a little more depth of flavor. I'm going to add some vanilla next time and maybe a touch of nutmeg and more sugar. Also might have to adjust temp/bake time so the outside not so brown.
2001729340,25885,2017-09-25,0,"An excellent recipe. I have also adapted it for making in 'dutch ovens'. We make 2 to 4 kilos at one time and it t freezes well Generally I put chopped cherry, raisins and candy peel in the mix. I am extreme in my measurements and this only leaves the variation with the banana type to chance. Here in Indonesia we have dozens if not hundreds of banana types and not all are suitable for cooking. One last comment. The world has been metric for over 40 years, solids are in grams, liquids are millilitres, but I just weigh everything. It makes life easy."
1179225,25885,2017-10-31,5,Perfect! I had to bake mine an additional 15 mins.
10365742,25885,2018-04-27,5,"I added a dash of cinnamon and few drops of vanilla. Really gave it added flavor, to make a non banana bread eater like myself."
2002189764,25885,2018-09-12,5,I added cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla extract It was very easy to make!
928171,25885,2018-11-03,5,"Very good! I only had two cups of bananas, and I added in peanut butter chips. I made muffins with them, and baked them for about 30 minutes. 2018- 9 years later this is still delicious! I still add peanut butter chips and pecans. I do end up having to bake it a bit longer than stated, but it's worth it!"
2002330086,25885,2018-12-14,5,"I too added vanilla, cinnamon, and baking powder. Very moist and delish!!"
229832,130815,2005-07-25,3,I made this in the little foil disposable pans. I only got 7 out of the recipe. The texture is good but I think it needs more flavor.. I might try it again and add choc chips. Thanks... 
235198,130815,2007-06-25,5,"Absolutely wonderful, thanks for sharing."
526654,130815,2007-07-07,3,"turned out real good
gilcamp4"
540523,130815,2007-07-19,3,I liked the texture but it needed more flavor I added more cinn. and choc chips and made cream cheese icing. It was good Thanks!!!
164182,130815,2007-09-05,5,"Very nice.  I didn't in anyway thing this lacked flavor.  Perhaps the I hate zucchini fooled them into thinking it would taste like chocolate cake.  I was surprise that only a teaspoon of soda made it rise so nicely, but it did.  I used oil because I was sure it would be the easiest to stir, and it was very easy to stir by hand.  I am going to attempt to health it up a bit the next time and go half apple sauce in place of the oil.

I did add a little flax seed in place of nuts."
458927,130815,2007-11-30,5,fabulous! i used a touch more zucchini and  about 1/2 cup sugar.  I also used olive oil and you could not taste it.  Super good.
409584,130815,2008-07-17,5,Delicious! I made 3 loaves last night and by this afternoon only one is left! :)
611548,130815,2008-08-08,5,Yummy.  I used whole wheat flour and a little extra baking soda.  The recipe adapted well.
838679,130815,2008-08-16,5,This was very good.  I also added 8 oz. of crushed (drained) pineapple.  That sure made it moist and yummy!
262962,130815,2009-06-21,5,Loved this recipe!  Will make over and over again =)
925024,130815,2009-07-16,5,"Excellent!  I definately would use an extra egg to add moisture.  It was wonderful.

:)"
441981,293262,2008-07-16,5,"i haven't made this, but i have had the one at Art's and yummy! we have a house on glen lake and my son is wearing an Art's t-shirt right this very moment :)"
566447,293262,2009-03-25,4,yummy - i used ciabatta and did not use the butter b/c i grilled in a sandwich maker... i like the peppers and the swiss - very tasty... shall try again soon with my regular wheat bread.
485915,293262,2009-10-20,5,So great!  Grilled Cheese's Big Brother.  I loved the freshness of the tomatoes and addition of the banana peppers.  I'm not a big fan of traditional grilled cheese but I could eat these all the time.
37449,293262,2008-04-17,5,"Yummy! At the last minute I found out my swiss cheese had gone bad, so subbed with Monterey Jack cheese. I enjoyed the banana pepper in there too! Thanks!"
398275,293262,2008-04-29,5,"I made these today for lunch and served them to my mom and her neighbor.  We loved them!  The addition of swiss cheese was wonderful and the peppers gave the sandwich a nice kick.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, vitalev!  **Made for Spring PAC 2008**  Edit to add:  Considering I've made these at least once a week since my first review, they definitely deserve 5 stars!!!  My weekly grocery list always includes the ingredients to make this delicious sandwich. :)"
400708,293262,2011-12-08,5,"What a great grilled cheese, made this for dinner last night and DH declared it the best we've had.  I also made recipe#246097 and added that to it.  YUMMY to the max.  I was so pleased and know we'll be having it again.  I did take a photo but my darn computer is acting up so will have to post that later.  Made for Let's PARTY 2011"
356062,260531,2007-11-12,5,"This past week I have been on an asparagus kick it seems, and this is one of my favortie asparagus recipes so far. I used low sodium broth and scaled it down to serve two. The sauce is lovely, and much more healthy than the regular cream sauce too! I plan on trying this with other veggies soon."
133842,260531,2008-03-05,4,Made and enjoyed for Photo swap....I really liked this dish.  I will be using this sauce for more than just asparagas...YUMMMY
869184,260531,2011-05-14,5,This is absolutely delicious and definitely worthy of company and for holiday family dinners. We used low sodium chicken broth and would next time add a tad of salt to bring out the flavours more and perhaps add a dash of lemon juice as well. But really - these are very minor recommendations - the dish is fantastic just the way it is. We used raw whole almonds and did not blanch them which added a tad more almond flavour as well. It is one of the recipes that somehow are more than the sum of their parts.
6357,86362,2004-03-12,5,"This was delicious, easy to make and so good in every way! We had it for dessert this afternoon. It got over before I realised it;-) Thank you so much for sharing!"
133703,86362,2004-03-18,5,"Delicious!  I did make a couple of changes (sustituting brown sugar for white, and 1/2 cup wholewheat flour for 1/2 cup white), and I added all the optional items.  The mix is very stiff before it goes into the tin, but with all the apple it comes out very moist - almost like a pudding rather than cake.  Hot or cold it's awesome.  It keeps well in the fridge."
50948,86362,2004-03-29,5,I've followed stocksy's suggestions for I need fiber in my diet. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you Katherine for posting this sensational dessert. ;D
258080,86362,2006-09-16,5,Very simple and very good!  I used all whole wheat instead of white.  Next time I want to try with raisins and nuts.
294000,75911,2006-05-27,5,"I give this 5 stars on behalf of my 14 month old daughter who couldn't get enough...she ate the whole thing! 
I've been looking for healthy recipes for her and this fits the bill perfectly.  I cut the cooking time down by microwaving a small red potato and throwing a small chicken breast on the George Foreman.  I also added some no-salt added peas, which she loves.  Thanks again...can't wait to try some of your other baby food recipes."
740247,75911,2008-05-30,5,"I made this for my 22 month old and she loved it.  She isn't much of a meat eater so I put 1/8 C. of chicken, boiled and cubed potatoes, 1/8 C. peas, a pinch of garlic powder and onion powder and I threw in some colby cheese.  I tried it too, it was very good!  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!"
467341,75911,2009-01-01,5,My daughter loves it and makes mmm... sounds when eating it..lol!  Thanks for a great recipe.
524733,118667,2007-09-02,5,I have this recipe in my recipe book at home already and it is outstanding. I baked mine in a bundt pan however and ommitted the topping and it was perfectly delicious without it. From a person who is not a big fan of rhubarb-this cake converted me!
125388,99222,2007-07-07,5,"Very good; very garlicky.  We ate one roll as described, cut into small pieces as an appetizer.  The other roll I ate the next day for lunch as a wrap sandwich."
140132,99222,2008-01-16,5,These are sooo good.  I used the turkey and tripled the recipe.  I sliced them for appies and took to sons wrestling meet for hospitality room.  HUGE HIT.  I will be making them again for us at home.  DD couldn't grab the ends fast enough when I was slicing them....LOL.  Thank you for this yummy new appy....Stephanie
95743,20505,2005-09-07,5,"Naturally sweet and creamy smooth dessert or salad.  I've been trying to cut back on sugar so I only used half the honey and butter spray rather than butter,to no ill effect.  Delightful, Dancer."
369566,20505,2007-10-02,5,"This was an incredible combination of some of my favorite flavors!  I served it with biscuits, spreading the goat cheese on them and it was delicious!  It would also be wonderful over mixed greens.  Oh, and I used agave nectar in place of honey because it's what I had on hand."
53932,20505,2011-11-14,5,"This is divine!  The flavors are so good--sweet,tangy and delicious"
2511088,490283,2012-11-19,0,I made these for a church potluck over the weekend and they were a big hit.  I did add a little balsamic vinegar to the brown sugar/soy sauce mixture because I thought it needed a little acidity but otherwise made as directed.<br/>(not sure why these were called Arkansas green beans but they were good nonetheless :)<br/>I'm from Arkansas!
835727,490283,2012-12-06,5,"I made this for my daughter, she has extremely sensitive taste buds, so finding something tasty, easy to prepare and economical to make is a joy. I made it as directed and it was a winner."
1579905,490283,2012-12-08,5,Made these tonight.  Will make again!  Thank you for sharing.
88099,490283,2013-11-29,5,A huge hit at our Thanksgiving Dinner last night.  Like other I cut the sugar in half and doubled the sauce because I used 8 cans of green beans.  I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes and they turned out so good.  You wanted to lick the sauce right out of the pan.  I was hesitant to add the soy sauce but did and am glad I did.  Just a perfect blend of flavors to liven plain old green beans.  Thanks so much for sharing.
305531,490283,2014-03-16,5,Great green beans. I only made 2 servings and they were a real hit. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for I Recommend Tag.
199848,141780,2008-06-29,5,"Wow!  What a quick little treat to whip up!  The cinnamon, cayenne and paprika worked so well together.  I love avocados and I'm happy to have a new exciting way to enjoy them  Thanx!"
197023,141780,2005-10-22,5,"I was drawn to this recipe because I LOVE avocado!  But I don’t like things hot and spicy, so I reduced – well, in effect, removed – the heat by using sweet paprika and by using black pepper rather than cayenne.  I also used cashews rather than peanuts because I prefer them, and always have some on hand.  A delicious blend of flavours and textures, so simple to make, and such a simple concept but it’s certainly not something that’s ever occurred to me or that I‘ve ever come across before!  A great memento of Africa (I’ve made this for the 2005 Zaar World Tour), that I’ll be making again, and often, and which I’m looking forward to sharing with others.  This is going to be a great dish to take to work during summer.  Even the name is evocative!  Thank you so much for posting this, Kate!"
168921,141780,2005-10-23,5,Simple and good! (No heat for me!)
169969,141780,2005-10-27,5,I loved the flavors in this simple avocado salad! This is well worth the try! I put the peanuts and spices in a bag and crushed them together - they were a wonderful complement to the lemon and avocado.
203467,141780,2006-01-21,5,Great recipe! We are avocado fans and it disappeared quickly. I love the cinnamon flavor. 
222564,141780,2006-06-01,5,"Very good, new flavor combination and simple as anything! I did as ncmysteryshopper with great results!"
145352,141780,2006-06-20,5,Easy and good!
296809,141780,2006-06-21,5,"This was great for my lunch today. I do so love avocado & opted for the sweeter version (this time) by using sweet paprika w/the cinnamon I pleasantly found a nice touch & had never used b4 w/avocado. Like another reviewer, I also used cashews that I always have on hand & love for their richer flavour. I also love using chives w/avocado & confess to using more than most would consider a garnish. This is so versatile & easy to fix. I liked it a lot, Kate. Thx for posting!"
121690,141780,2007-08-05,5,Loved this very unique treat!
385678,141780,2008-06-21,5,My whole family was so impressed with how yummy this strange avocado treat was!  My DD that normally doesn't like avocados actually ate this right up!  Made for ZWT4 - Los Jefes de la Cocina.
223854,141780,2008-06-23,5,"Yummy, I ate this for lunch and I really enjoyed the it. The spice, and peanuts really complimented the avocado. I have now become a huge fan of African cruise.  Thank you Chef Kate *Made for Zaar World Tour 4*"
590105,141780,2008-06-23,4,Interesting and tasty!  I ate about half of it before deciding to add salt (now I see it's part of the recipe. huh-huh.) and it brought out the other flavors.  I think this would be great with cumin instead of  paprika/cinnamon.  Though probably not as authentic.  Reviewed for ZWT4.
337963,141780,2008-06-25,4,"LOVED IT!  Kate, I'd never tried peanuts with avocados before, DELICIOUS!  I made this for hubby and was instantly jealous...but it was okay 'cause he shared :)  I chose this recipe for the ZWT Spice it Up challenge, meaning that I got to play with the spices.  I reduced the paprika and cinnamon to half their amounts and added equal amounts of curry and tumeric.  I substituted ground dried chilis and freshly ground black pepper for the cayenne.  Thank you for posting Kate!  Made for ZWT, please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
80353,141780,2008-06-29,5,"Very different and delicious.  The peanuts added both flavour and a great textural contrast to the butter-smooth avocado.  I wasn't expecting the cinnamon to work, but it was great!"
324390,141780,2008-07-01,5,This is what I love about ZWT... being introduced to flavor combinations that are new to me. This made a nice afternoon snack. Thank you Chef Kate.
376986,141780,2011-06-25,2,Edible but not great.  Maybe I didn't have good ingredients or didn't do something right.
58104,67203,2003-08-29,5,Very good I used lavender honey yummy comfort food.I precooked the acorn in the microwave till half done then mixed the rest of the ingredients (adding cinnamon)filled the acorn and finished it on the grill.
213939,67203,2007-03-20,5,I made this for my family who is very picky. They all loved it.
1601033,67203,2010-04-20,5,"I was looking for something to make with the first ribs of the season on the grill and found this recipe. I used a little molasses instead of honey and allspice instead of nutmeg, and it was delicious! Very simple and a great alternative to the usual corn on the cob with grilling!"
2579483,67203,2013-05-03,0,"I only had one squash to use and not a huge amount of time so I peeled and diced my squash, precooked it for a few minutes in the microwave then followed the remainder of the recipe as written.  It was VERY VERY good, not too sweet or overly spiced which let you still taste the squash not not feel like you&#039;re eating a pie!  It was wonderful, will most definitely make this again."
47892,363791,2012-06-15,5,"This is my usual go to homemade ranch dressing recipe: Recipe #41602 which I used to make your recipe. Fresh local honey and the hubby liked this especially. It reminded me of cole slaw dressing (which I love!) Be sure to prepare the dressing several hours ahead for best flavor. Served with a simple tossed salad of butter lettuce, cucumber, tomato and carrots. Will make again! Reviewed for NA*ME tag/June."
169430,363791,2012-08-09,5,I made a half recipe for DH and went ahead with using the honey. No fresh parsley so I added a small amount of dried. Takes no time at all to make (I made it last night) and Hubby loved it as a dip for lunch time chicken nuggets. :D
37449,412656,2010-02-19,5,"I used almond milk and strawberry yogurt(it's what I had on hand) and this was yummy! A great way to start out the day!

Made for Newest Zaar Tag."
383346,398589,2012-03-19,5,The taste of these burgers are so good.  I used dried parsley.  Thanks Drunk Chef :)  Made for PAC Spring 2012
153067,398589,2010-02-28,5,"Yup, amazing they are!  I LOVE the idea of making a dense log and cutting them...how INGENIOUS!  I needed a cerrated knife though to cut.  I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  This makes the most perfect flavorful burger ever!  A keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing such a fabulous recipe!  XO LA :-)"
498271,398589,2010-04-11,5,Wow - great burgers!  I minced the onion and garlic very small and they gave a great flavor throughout the meat.  Juicy and tasty burgers on the grill - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring PAC 2010
614389,398589,2011-03-17,4,My Husband and I loved these burgers. The flavor was delicious. Thank you for the recipe.
449482,398589,2011-09-26,5,These were wonderful!!!!!  I cut the butter a little and added some Worcestershire sauce and these were amazing.
286566,298638,2010-06-20,3,"Overall in the end they turned out great.  I did peel my potatoes (my lot would not enjoy them with it on - a curse I think) but followed recipe through but came to a bit of problem what to do with the butter - in the end I melted in the microwave with the oil (scaled back as I only used 4 potatoes) and though I had put the fresh herbs in I drizzled some of the melted mix between slices and the rest over the potatoes but then we struck a little disaster in that the roast beef was taking longer to cook than expeccted so I had to turn the temperature down to make sure the potatoes did not burn but we ended up with potatoes with a crispy outside but not as flavoursome as I would have liked.  Would suggest if you are supposed to mix olive oil and butter together maybe put the thyme leaves in as well infuse the flavour.  Thank you *Aria* for a recipe that as great protential for us, made for Heathly Choices ABC."
452940,459273,2011-07-05,4,"What better way to celebrate the 4th and summertime than with fresh fruit. I placed rows of strawberries and banana slices rather than top the bananas with them. Although I didn't get 13 stripes, but it was still festive and delectable. :)"
1269015,421603,2010-06-05,4,"The flavor was pretty good, though I did add in some vanilla and used sugar instead of syrup. However, the bread fell apart on the griddle in spite of using oil and it being nonstick to begin with. The consequence of not using eggs, I suppose. I'd make this again, but I'll look for other eggless hopefully-will-hold-together-better recipes first."
182713,338907,2009-01-02,5,This stuffing is definitely AMAZING!  I love how the seasonings are baked into the bread and the flavor is absolutely wonderful. I froze it ahead of time as you suggested and it worked out great!
1802813911,530683,2017-03-19,5,Love the combination of these flavors! Amazing on a toasted Asiago or Everything bagel as well.
1699397,213144,2010-10-21,4,"I used this for my first tofu sandwich. The marinade was good. I'm going to have to get used to the tofu on my sandwich, though."
13063,29835,2002-09-28,5,"These are some dangerous little muffins, Miss Annie!  I toasted the pecans before adding them to the mix.  My husband, who is not very big on pastries, had three of these as soon as they came out of the oven.  I won't tell you how many I ate, except to say that shortly thereafter we went on a muffin-ing mission to our families' houses to get these things out of our own!  Like little pieces of pecan pie, these are... I've already been requested to make another batch to bring them to a family gathering tomorrow evening, but I have the feeling that I'll need to make two.  These things disappear quickly.  Wow, thank you, these are *wonderful*!!!"
118163,29835,2004-04-16,5,"Wow...All I can say is, ""Wow"". I just love these little guys! I made them for a party that I was throwing for my bosses birthday, but they never made it out the door. My father, mother, sister, dogs, rats, and I just ate them all up. Thank you for a wonderful recipe Annie!"
45999,29835,2004-04-25,5,"These are wonderful little morsels.  I used walnuts like stated in the recipe but will certainly try pecans next time.  I highly recommend these.  Also, I would check after 20 minutes in the oven."
64583,29835,2004-04-27,5,"Delicious muffins!  So easy to make, very rich and moist, and the kitchen smelled great while they were baking.  I got 21 mini muffins and they baked for exactly 25 minutes.  I know I'll use this recipe over and over.  

"
182624,29835,2005-01-15,5,"These are really good.  Great walnut taste.  Even my picky husband liked them...we joked about the ""mouse"" that kept getting into them and eating them all.  Definitely check them after 20 minutes, and if you grease and flour your pan they pop out beautifully."
95743,29835,2008-03-21,5,"Can't believe something this easy tastes so good.  A great excuse to buy a can of oil/flour cooking spray.  Worked perfectly.  I got 22 flat-topped muffins that I need protection from.  I used whole wheat flour and even so they were delectable.  A cookie scoop will help assure evenly sized muffins and less mess.  They baked 12 minutes, I turned them front to back and baked them another 13 minutes.   Perfect.   I'm testing the ""freezes well"" theory tonight."
242484,29835,2008-03-27,4,"A lovely, delicately sweet muffin that is super easy to put together in a snap!"
167349,29835,2010-01-16,5,"These are delicious!  My mom tried batch #1 exactly as written (except used pecans instead of walnuts).  They tasted good, but were quite a bit more cakey than the once at the ACC.  She doubled the butter for the second batch, and while still tasty, not really the right consistency.

I couldn't stand it so I tried a third batch with her suggestions: increase flour to 3/4 cup and increase butter to 1 stick (the recipe was looking more like a blondie recipe!).  I think that made all the difference!  They are moist and brownie-like and absolutely addicting!  I'm so glad I can make these at home and don't have to wait for a visit to Abilene to get them!"
866963,29835,2010-03-03,5,"I made these as written with the exception of using pecans instead of walnuts (I was out of walnuts) and they came out very good.  They came together very quickly and filled the ""I want something sweet"" craving this morning."
659079,29835,2013-01-13,0,"Sorry, I had trouble with the muffins.  I used a Wilton mini-muffin pan that is not teflon but used Baker's Joy in each muffin round.   Had trouble with them sticking.   Do you pack the brown sugar??  I did and maybe that is too much brown sugar?"
1800034832,173337,2013-08-27,5,Muffins that have such a limited serving of sugar...sure to be a staple in my kid&#039;s lunch box this year!
38218,177191,2006-10-13,5,This turned out great.  I used a chocolate cake mix and added a big (Iguess 12 oz) pkg of butterscotch chips and a stick of margerine.  So easy. Perfect for DD no measuring.  This made a nicer cookie than the other cake mix cookies that call for oil.
592110,177191,2007-09-19,5,"I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and 3/4 cup of Crisco.  I got a very fudgy flavored cookie.  Also, great tip.  After you roll in ball and press flat in crystal sugar.  Gives nice sheen to cookie.  Also would problably work for holiday cookies using a white cake mix and add color to it or use colored sugar."
245017,177191,2008-02-29,5,"This was fantastic. I used a Strawberry cake mix, 1/2 cup of butter and I baked them for 12 minutes. I also used my cookie scoop so they were all perfectly round and the same size. I think I got about 28 cookies. Oh I also chilled the dough for about an hour. I think this made it easier to work with."
36525,177191,2008-07-03,0,"I tried this w/ yellow cake mix, used butter and a spash of vanilla extract, I also rolled them in a sugar and cinnamon mix after they were finish baking. I threw most of them in the trash, they left a terrible taste in my mouth.  I'm sorry, I wanted to like them."
628779,177191,2008-07-04,5,My daughter has been making these since she was 7. So easy and tastey too.
851405,177191,2008-12-21,5,"These are really awesome.  My kids loved them.  We used the funfetti cake mix and we have used a white cake mix.  Both turned out great.  The lemon supreme cookies were my favorite.   Just a note,  if you are going to change the recipe I really don't think its fair to give a negative review....."
411833,177191,2009-12-09,5,I was looking for a simple cookie recipe.  I only had a yellow cake mix but I added a small box of sugar-free strawberry jello.  It added a nice flavor and pretty color.  The dough is very easy to handle.  I will definitely use this recipie again.
1557425,177191,2010-02-22,5,"REALLY yummy, beautiful cookies! I used Betty Crocker's Super Moist Spice Cake, and then followed the recipe, and got super yummy spice cookies. I had my first bite of them after they had sat on the baking pan for 4 hours---didn't have time to move them to the cooling rack---and they were soft and delicious. Great recipe!"
56003,177191,2010-06-19,5,"Holy cow, Rachel!  There'll never be a reason not to have cookies in the house, as I always take advantage of the cake mix sales!  For my first batch, I used my cherry chip mix.  Delicious.  Can hardly wait to try the other flavors.  Thnx for sharing your recipe.  Made for the Voracious Vagabonds of ZWT 6."
6836,177191,2011-10-03,5,"Excellent cookies!  I used a caramel cake mix, and added chopped walnuts and milk chocolate covered Heath bits -- yummy!  I found that leaving the cookie dough in mounds made a softer cookie, which I liked better than the flattened ones.  Can't wait to try other cake mix flavors -- thanks for posting!  -M =D"
1651233,177191,2013-12-14,5,"I admit, I was skeptical. I tried these with a butter pecan cake mix and pressed them down with a half pecan piece. Yum! Really moist and sooo easy! What more can you ask for?"
1802626893,177191,2015-02-07,5,My  sons 8 year old daughter is spending the weekend with me.  Thank you for a great easy recipe.  I love doing things with her.  She likes experimenting.  This recipe turned out perfect. It is definitely a keeper and number one on out &quot;cooking with grandma list&quot;.
2000523082,177191,2015-11-05,5,"This is an awesome recipe! Exactly what I was looking for, though much easier than I thought. Thank you for a simple but great recipe. Made a sort of snickledoodle type cookie. Whike cake eeith cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. 
I agree with the other person who said saying something negative about a recipe that isnt what you posted is not fair. Just know, this recipe is perfect as posted."
2000257118,177191,2015-12-04,5,"Super easy, tasty cookies!  I used white cake and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them.  They were a big hit!"
131674,418544,2010-05-17,5,Great dip!  I added a few more dill pickle pieces than it called for because we love the taste.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Photo Tag.
428885,418544,2010-12-04,5,"Pickles are my favorite and there is nothing better then a pickle in a dip! Oh this is the best dip - I should be better and have not eaten so much. I could barely stand it until it got cold - (the dip) and I had cucumbers? and beloved pickle chips dipping in this dip faster then you can say, ""pickle"". Very easy to put together - and so good - you can't go wrong with this!"
2626552,267703,2013-01-10,0,Soooo easy and so good.  I didn't have any pesto so I made it without it.  I just added a little sea salt.  I'll never use canned tomato soup again! This is easier and way better than canned. ;)
59064,23500,2003-01-14,5,"Well, my 21 month old has just wandered into the room with Banana Orange shake all around her mouth, down her arms and her top, glass in hand going ""More, more"".

43083,23500,2005-04-10,4,Hey Bev! I bought a large container of plain yogurt and have been looking for things to use it for. This was the quick pick me up I needed this afternoon! I liked the yogurt and next time might use vanilla:) Thanks again!
197023,23500,2006-05-06,5,"Loved the blend of orange and lime in this shake! I made mine with Greek yoghurt, simply because it's what I always use. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

160974,23500,2007-03-04,5,"I made this for my breakfast, using lemon juice. This was creamy, frosty, and satisfying. Thanks Bev, for posting.

422893,23500,2007-12-18,4,"I made this for toddler DD minus the sugar, she thought it was a great after swimming snack, even let me have a try, yum. Thanks Bev!"
534623,23500,2008-05-19,5,Great recipe! The lime juice added something special. Thanks for sharing!
56463,190686,2006-10-26,5,"Delicious! I used two cans of apple pie filling and omitted the lemon juice, sugar and flour. We loved the pecan topping, but since I love nuts I think I will double the amount of nuts on the bottom and in the topping next time. Almost like candies apples. Thanks, Carole in Orlando"
171790,259154,2008-09-24,3,This is good but we found the seasonings to be a bit too strong for our tastes. If future I would try reducing the amount of ginger and soy sauce. We really enjoyed the almonds with the asparagus. Made for PAC Fall '08
542159,393579,2009-10-14,5,Very yummy. Will defiantly be making again. DH created a few hiccups in the making of this recipe as he bought boneless thighs and large red potatoes. The solution cut the potatoes into quarters and cut the cook time on the chicken by 25 minutes. But despite that this came together beautifully and tasted great. Thanks so much for the post.
52448,119632,2005-05-26,5,This was very good and easy to put together. I added some finely chopped red pepper after it was cooked since I still had that in the fridge and it was nice with that. I served it with herbed toast
80353,141881,2006-02-25,5,Absolutely delicious!  I didn't add the chives as I didn't want the carrots to have an oniony flavour.  We loved these.
189616,141881,2006-04-09,4,"Interesting flavor, I did expect them too be sweeter though. I used red balsamic vinegar, which did not make the dish terribly attractive. I would believe the white/clear balsamic vinegar would be a much better choice-but our Supermarkets do not carry that type. Didn't have any chives so used green onions.
Thanks Lvs2Cook!"
60992,141881,2006-04-13,5,My husband is not a huge cooked carrrot fan....he asked what I did to make the carrots SO good this time!!! I used only 2 t. of sugar and just a tad less than half a cup as I don't like my carrots too sweet. Theese went together exactly as the directions said and they turned out perfect. I KNOW these will be a repeat in our home.
560491,373454,2011-06-07,5,"This is a very flavorful marinade!  I used it on 2 large pork steaks and let it marinate it for 4 days.  I didn't add the jalapeno since we do not eat a lot of spicy foods, but next time I made add a little...Made for ZWT 7-THE HOT PINK LADIES."

186979,274637,2010-02-07,5,"I've wanted to make authentic beaten biscuits for ages but just never took the time. It was a perfect, snowy day at the cottage which provided me the time and patience to try these antique biscuits. As Molly says, these are NOT the biscuits that you get at KFC or Pillsbury; they taste like Carr's Water Biscuits but are slightly softer and puffier. I made two batches: the 1st batch the true ""beaten"" way: mixed everything in a bowl, kneaded it, then placed the dough on the counter and beat it with a wooden ladle for 25 minutes. Never having made these before, I had no idea what the dough should look or feel like, but it felt ""correct"", so I cut them out and baked them for the 30 minutes at 350. They turned out flawlessly: a pale ivory colour and perfect texture--a soft cracker. The 2nd batch that I made, I thought like a ""modern"" person and made the batch in my food processor: I added the dry ingredients and butter in the bowl and whirled it around for 5 minutes. After that time, I slowly poured the milk into the bowl, and 1 tablespoon more, and it formed a ball instantly. Stopped machine, took out the dough and it felt identical to the hand beaten version: soft, velvety and pliable. I used a 2"" biscuit cutter; this recipe doesn't list what size to use (original recipe never listed it in the book). I am so glad that I made these both ways and will continue to make them in the future as they were so tasty and fun to create. I can see why they are a Kentucky tradition!"
1531249,274637,2011-06-24,5,"I made this recipe with my kids as part of a homeschool project, and it was a real hit (no pun intended!).  We took a hybrid approach to the beating- 15 minutes by hand and a few minutes in the food processor.  The finished product was tasty and unusual.  I suspect my family will be asking to make this recipe again.  Thanks so much."
135566,377082,2009-10-11,5,"I've never tried a BLT with avocado and it's a great addition.  I lightly salted the avocado and tomato slices and didn't measure out the mayo, just slathered it on the toast until it looked right to me.  Made for Fall 2009 Pick A Chef Adoptions."
131126,377082,2009-10-11,0,"I made this for a quick lunch. I used black pepper smoked bacon.  I enjoyed the contrast of the creaminess in the avocado against the spicy bacon.  Crisp romaine lettuce leaves, a slice of beef steak tomato, and a multigrain sandwich thin bun rounded out the sandwich.  I used fat free mayo & a sweet hot mustard. Made for Fall 09 Pick A Chef."
174096,377082,2009-10-13,5,Wonderful addition to a BLT!  I used a low-fat avocado and fat-free mayonnaise and omitted the optional mustard.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PAC Orphanage Fall 09.
475484,378142,2011-02-16,5,The easiest most delicious Icecream! I cant believe how creamy it turned out just one tip make sure you have great tasting banana's cause the quality will really show through Ty Wild Thyme Flour
58038,64846,2004-04-20,5,"Easy, make ahead recipe with tasty dressing.  The bright contrasting colors look great on the table too.  Wasn't sure about the combination of asparagus and strawberry but it works.  This did make a lot of dressing.  I added it just to coat (we don't like things swimming in dressing) and saved the rest for extra strawberries or another salad.  I didn't use the blue cheese since we don't like it."
66008,64846,2004-04-24,5,"We are in the middle of strawberry and asparagus season in CA and I had both in my refrigerator when I came across this recipe, so I decided to try it. This was a delightful salad, even though I was a little leary of the combination. I did not have or use the blue cheese. We ate this with sweet and sour pork chops (using fresh pineapple.) The tastes couldn't have been better together!! Thanks for the new recipe! Can't wait to introduce it to friends."
298625,64846,2006-03-03,5,"This dish was such a hit that my discerning girlfriend, when she went back home to New Orleans, made it for her mother."
141293,64846,2007-03-27,5,"This salad dressing is outstanding!  As for the salad, I like a little more substance, so I added baby romaine and chopped spiced pecans.  A wonderful combination that I will make again.  Blue cheese was a wonderful addition."
145352,64846,2007-06-12,5,Sooo pretty!!!! My husband loved it!!!
319738,64846,2007-06-16,5,"My DH is very anit-strawberries in salads, so I made this using halved grape tomatoes instead--and it was still great!!!  Wonderful dressing and great flavor combination!  (My other substitute was to use a couple of dashes of onion powder in place of the grated onion.)  This is definitely a keeper and would be great for a potluck!  Thank you!!!"
37449,64846,2008-04-06,5,A very pretty salad with such different flavors! I reduced this down for 1 person and enjoyed it! Thank you Nimz!
133174,64846,2008-04-09,5,"This is a wonderful salad.  The sweetness of the poppy seed dressing  and fresh berries really makes a winning combination.  The ingredients were prepared and chilled in the refrigerator while the rest of dinner was cooking.  Not having the blue cheese, I substituted feta with great success.  This would be a wonderful salad for summer cookouts."
6258,40854,2002-12-07,5,"Terrific!  A nice change for breakfast.  It was filling, and easy to prepare.  Handed it to MrB on his way out the door, and he reported that he enjoyed it.  You could even add jam or preserves to the cream cheese if you didn't have bananas on hand.  Thanks, Inez! :-)"
125636,40854,2005-08-02,4,This was very quick and easy to make. I thought it was very creamy and tasty. Next time I would like to add some cinnamon to spice it up a little bit. On a busy morning this would be a great breakfast.
17803,40854,2005-11-16,5,"I agree this is very creamy. Keystone what a great idea, the cinnamon would be a fine addition to this recipe we'll have to try it the next time. I was glad to see my daughter make this as she has a bad habit of not eat breakfast in the morning. Nezz, thanks for a easy and fast recipe for breakfast and snack.  PS.  I have to tell you what we did with the leftover mixture.  At snack time I dipped NABISO Nilla (vanilla) Wafers in it the kids loved it!"
118685,40854,2006-12-14,3,"Was quick and easy.  I liked it, but kids were not asking for more.  May try it again sometime."
498271,371783,2013-03-19,5,"Great easy drink, perfect for a breakfast or midday snack!  I like the tang from the buttermilk with the banana.  I couldn&#039;t resist adding a sprinkle of cinnamon on top ;)  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2013"

518581,312254,2008-09-03,5,"I love this recipe!  Simple, easy and delicious.  I went with the classic ham and spinach.  I used Trader Joe's puff pastry for the crust and it took about 55 minutes to cook.  I've never put cheese at the bottom of a dish... I like it!  Thanks for a great base recipe.  I'm looking forward to making many varieties."
840701,312254,2009-10-29,5,"What a wonderful recipe this is! We have made MANY variations, and really...you can't go wrong! It's just so good!! I've used Trader Joe's puff pastry and their pie crust. It's delicious both ways. This is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Put your favorites on top of the cheese layer, and then add the egg mixture on top of everything. SO GOOD! It also took around 50-55 minutes to bake (like Motivated Mama). This is definitely one of our families ""go to"" meals...and it's a winner for all ages!"
323186,370748,2009-06-09,5,"An excellent dish, which I prepared to accompany recipe#271624 for a marvellous midweek supper. Easily put together, I prepared everything in advance, and the actual cooking goes very quickly with the minimum of fuss.  I subbed a vegetarian garlic and herb broth, rather than the chicken broth, in this way this becomes an excellent vegetarian main or side dish.
Wonderful flavour, this cooked perfectly and was very much enjoyed by all.

Made for Zingo! ZWT 5"
953275,370748,2009-06-09,5,"Made for ZWT 5 Zingo also.  This was a tasty rice dish, thanks!  I was a little confused with the directions as to when to stop putting things in the blender, but once I got cooking it made sense.  A few subs, I also used veg broth, and I used brown short grain rice.  I didn't find the need to add any more liquid with the brown rice.  Unfortunately didn't have zucchini or green beans so I used asparagus instead.  I think you could use any veg and it would work out well.  Kids loved it too - thanks!"
527886,370748,2009-06-10,4,"A tasty one-dish meal for summer produce. I made this all out of the garden (except the rice and olive oil). I went ahead and finished cooking the rice on the stovetop, instead of heating the oven. The grains were a little soft, but the dish is flavorful enough that we gobbled it down. I, too, found the order of the instructions quite difficult. I think it would be clearer to give the steps for making the sauce, then the vegetable/rice saute, then the assembly and final cooking. It's easy to make you've worked out the steps."
424680,370748,2009-06-12,5,"I went vegetarian with this recipe & used vegetable instead of chicken broth, but other than that I included everything as indicated & had a very satisfying dinner & even get a keeper of a recipe, too! Many thanks! [Tagged, made & reviewed during the ZINGO part of ZWT5]"
204024,370748,2009-06-13,5,"After seeing Magpie's picture I want to try this with asparagus!  DH is also intrigued with using some of the dried hot Mexican peppers in place of the sweet red one. This time, though, I made it exactly to the recipe and it came out great.  It was just one piece of a terrific ZWT supper, but DD16 commented that it was the rice that tied it all together, because it went so well with each other item on the plate.

179133,449891,2011-10-28,5,Yummy! I wasn't sure how many apples to buy for 4 cups so went with 4 large but only ended up needing 3 (about 1 3/4 lb) to fill the pan (and still have room for the topping!) I used 2 granny smith and 1 golden delicious. There was a lot of topping (which I loved!) I did have to bake a little longer for the apples to get tender (about 15 minutes extra). Thanks for sharing!
383346,449891,2011-11-22,5,This recipe is so yummy.  I used Empire apples.  I omitted the salt.  But other than that followed the recipe.  Thanks BarbaraAnn :)  Made for Cookbook tag game
476326,272337,2009-12-24,5,"Ultra sweet but my family can take it.  :)  Very good flavor, but it will puff up considerably so take note.  It made enough for 2 frozen pie shells.  I had made my own pie crust and used a 2 inch deep round biscuit pan.  In the end, it filled the biscuit pan and had enough left for a small pyrex bowl (a cook's bonus!)."

222478,21610,2006-08-24,5,"Wow, the bacon and peanuts were a wonderful combination! Rather than use shredded cabbage I used a pre-packaged coleslaw vegetable mix that contained both varieties along with some corn and carrot."

227652,137860,2006-06-21,5,"Delicious! I've been wanting a homemade marinara sauce to serve with chicken parmesan & I've finally found it! No more store bought spaghetti sauce-this is easier, more economical & tastier. I accidently used 1 tsp oregano & 1/4 tsp basil, which worked fine. I would suggest simmering the sauce for around 30 min-it thickens the sauce & blends the flavors better that way. I also used 1 tsp dried minced garlic from a jar, which worked fine as well; gave it a great garlicky flavor. Thanks, Dicewoman! "
577368,137860,2007-09-02,4,"This was good, but I used 8 oz of tomato sauce and 8 oz of petite diced tomatoes.  I also simmered for 30 min to let the flavors blend.  I didn't have rosemary or an onion (I did used dried chopped onions, though) and it was still excellent!"
697421,137860,2008-03-07,5,"This was great, fast and easy. I loved it."
126435,137860,2008-06-05,5,"I was in the middle of a OAMC spree, and had everything planned out that I was making. Well, I forgot and dumped all my jarred sauce into my cooked ground meat. I needed pasta sauce to spoon on top of recipe#204682. So I whipped this up in a flash. My only change to the recipe was to add 1/2 teaspoon of beef bouillion. It made the sauce taste like it had been simmering all day without allow it to sit at all! Veggie bouillion would probably do the same! Thanks for a WONDERFUL go to recipe!"
586291,137860,2008-06-12,5,"Yummy! I needed an easy Marinara sauce that doesn't use tomatoes, and here it is! My roommates gobbled it up. Thanks for the recipe!"
1021712,137860,2008-12-14,5,"Absolutely awesome! Just got through with dinner...I made canelloni and topped them with this sauce and my hubby looooooved the sauce! he says its better than the normal marinara sauce we usually buy. Only made one small change....instead of canned tomato sauce, I used 5 oven roasted tomatos (I just put 5 Roma tomatos in a cookie sheet in the oven and then pureed them). Grrrrrrreat!"
540346,137860,2009-04-07,5,"This was so easy and had an excellent flavor.  I used 3 cloves of minced garlic and added a can of whole tomatoes (in addition to the can of tomato sauce).  I omitted the sugar and olive oil.  I used the sauce on top of whole wheat rotini and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  It was fantastic.  I will definitely make again.  Oh, the kids like it, too!"
1328942,137860,2010-07-22,0,"Wow! This is absolutely delicious! To make it more chunky, simply throw everything in the food processor or blender. Update: I have been making this ever since I found the recipe. I use it as a dipping sauce and as my main spaghetti sauce as well. It is soo good and very easy. I love this recipe :)"
1939710,137860,2013-01-14,0,Delicious and easy to make.
2001248572,137860,2016-11-16,5,Yum-O!! I absolutely loved this quick and easy recipe which i used as a dipping sauce for my baked panko parmesan chicken fingers. Two thumbs up!! Thanks.
2001635972,137860,2017-07-21,5,"I added a little chopped garlic. I goofed and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. It was wonderful! I needed 1/2 cup of marinara sauce as part of a sauce for fish, and this was fabulous!!! A real keeper Thank you"
1242099,137860,2017-10-16,5,Super yummy. I think I about doubled the garlic. I used 8 oz tomato sauce and a 14 oz can of finely chopped tomatoes (Mutti... an italian imported brand I bought on sale at World Market). I think it would have also been fine with diced tomatoes mashed up a little. Very flavorful and would be a great dipping sauce. Was a perfect addition to angel hair pasta and breaded eggplant from Trader Joes. Thank you!
2001830683,137860,2017-11-29,5,I needed to make spaghetti and didn't have my usual ingredients. I googled recipes with a can of tomato sauce and found this terrific recipe. I was in a big hurry so I used granulated garlic and dehydrated onions. The only real change I made was to add a half teaspoon of chili powder to make the flavor less&quot;bright.&quot; I like this recipe much better than my own!
2002151592,137860,2018-05-13,5,"This was easy, and turned out delicious! We didn't cut the onions as small I would of liked, so I will make sure to dice mine smaller in the future."
95960,137860,2018-10-02,5,"I cut this recipe in half...it is perfect for the recipes I cook for just the two of us. After saut&eacute;ing the onions and garlic, I deglaze with a touch of red or white wine, add 1/2 Tbs of tomato paste and brown the paste a bit, then proceed with the recipe. Fantastic!"
2002325845,137860,2018-11-09,5,Fast and easy! Used onion powder instead of chopping onions and added at the time of oregano.
674022,389717,2009-09-16,5,This was a great dip. Gotta love Southern Living! I made it cold and had it at room temp per the instructions and it was yummy.The freshly made bacon and the creamy blue cheese were flavorful and the dip clung to crackers well.  I will post a picture soon.Thanks SarahBeth for posting. (Made for NEWEST ZAAR TAG-September 2009)
284180,389717,2009-11-15,5,"Delicious! I made it hot for the cold weather. :)  Put it all in the microwave for 1 minute, stirred it, and then another minute.  Nice and hot and flavorful served w/tortilla chips (also tried triscuits but didn't like it as well with them).  Next time I think I'll leave out the onion and then top w/ sliced green onion instead, for some visual interest."
869184,389717,2009-11-29,5,This dip got rave reviews; I really don't like blue cheese so I did not try it. My husband thought it was absolutely amazing. I made as written without any substitutions. I served it cold. Made for Went to the Market tag

We used it on some oven fries,and they were SO delicious...a perfect amount of heat!!
This will get well used in my house,as it's so versatile and can be quickly whipped up from store cupboard ingredients.

841895,187210,2009-06-10,5,"I used this to make pork chops a few days ago. While the chops didn't come out all that great, the seasoning tasted really good. I will be keeping this around and looking for a better pork chop recipe to use it in. Thanks!"
678366,187210,2010-04-15,5,This is the perfect seasoning for French Fries! Ingredients always on hand and anyway this is not available in the stores so one more reason to be so happy for finding it. Thanks for sharing this.
463435,187210,2010-05-25,5,Great seasoning blend...wonderful flavor without one spice overpowering the other. It is one my family will enjoy as it doesn't add to much heat. Another plus is it is made with spices and herbs I always have on hand. Thanks for posting Elmotoo. Made and reviewed for the 40th AUS/NZ Recipe Swap.
383346,187210,2011-03-06,5,I made it without salt.  This is really good.  Tonight we tried it on french fries.  Thanks Elmotoo :)  Made for PAC spring 2011
870705,187210,2013-11-30,5,Great Cajun seasoning blend.  Not too spicy.  Like you did I tried it out on Redneck Epicurean&#039;s recipe#146464 and it turned out wonderfully!  Made for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap.
174096,41722,2008-10-22,4,"A nice, simple to make soup.  I used skim milk and 2% cheese and stir fried the asparagus in non-stick cooking spray before adding it to the pot.  Thanks for sharing!"
424680,382265,2009-09-24,5,"This recipe makes for A GREAT TASTING PUDDING ~ We enjoyed the flavor combo of apricot & coconut, & another time I might just add a little bit of shredded coconut to the mix!

767712,166813,2010-02-14,5,I had this recipe from a magazine and I made it a few nights ago.  OH MY GOSH it is amazing.  by far the best ice cream cake i've ever had in my life....and I love love LOVE ice cream cake!  Thanks for posting.
1085428,382309,2009-07-24,5,"These were so easy to make and absolutely delicious! Quite the different take on nachos but still yummy. The baked beans add a great touch, too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
285039,382309,2009-08-28,5,My Dad loves Famous Dave's...so I made him a whole Famous Dave's meal including this.  These are quick and easy and tasted fabulous!
174096,382309,2011-01-19,5,"We've never been to Famous Dave's, but we sure enjoyed these!  I used homemade baked beans (Recipe #407334) - what a fun way to use up leftover baked beans.  Thanks for sharing!"
2284525,382309,2012-06-04,5,These were awesome...I actually used chili beans instead of baked beans and they were awesome!
28177,370976,2009-05-17,5,"As soon as I saw this cake I knew I had to make it!  I just had to wait til the bananas were ready.  I followed the instructions exactly, except where it said to add 1/2 cup of baking soda.  I think it's just a typo & I had excellent results using only 1/2 teaspoon of soda.  The end result was a deliciously moist, single-layer cake with an exciting combination of flavors.  How can you go wrong with banana cake or the lime & coconut combo?  So why NOT put them all together!  Much less guilt this way!  ;)  This is a must try for anyone that likes banana bread, as that is the prominent flavor.  The citrus is a little added kick & the coconut keeps the cake moist & adds a nice texture.  I think I would consider flavoring the cream cheese frosting next time, with lime zest maybe.  This time I added a few drops of neon green food coloring, just for fun.  :)  We'll be making this cake again & again!  Thanks for posting it, Syd!  Made & enjoyed for Zaar World Tour 5 - Ali Baba's Babes."
1155210,370976,2009-05-20,5,"Very good!! I really like the banana in it, it keeps it so moist and soft. I love the lime too, even added some zest to the batter and also some juice and zest to the icing. Thanks for posting this Sydney! Made for ZWT5"
394085,370976,2009-08-24,5,"Utterly scrumptious!  Moist,  slightly chewy from the coconut, sweet and tart from the lime frosting.  I would have been happy with it without the frosting--it is plenty moist--as more of a coffeecake, but the frosting put it way over the top!  I garnished with both the toasted coconut and a second lime's grated peel.  Also, I mixed the rest of the first lime's juice (about 2 T) into the frosting so it was nicely tart and flavorful.  I can't recommend this highly enough!"
424680,430060,2012-04-07,5,"My other half is always trying to get me to use more sun-dried tomatoes, so your recipe was just what I needed when I made 2 pizzas using your pizza base recipe! The pizzas had a combo of cheeses along with Canadian Bacon, pineapple & some ripe olives! Pairing all that with your sauce, & was were in pizza heaven! Many thanks! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this Spring's round of Pick A Chef]"
444132,370976,2011-01-14,5,"So delicious!  The lime, coconut, and banana all assert themselves in this cake, and the cream cheese frosting provides a delicious tart/sweet as well.  It's so pretty, too!  My springform pan doesn't have a hole, so I ended up baking it an extra 15 minutes to cook through the middle.  Also, when I combined the butter mixture and the banana/milk mixture, it curdled, but it didn't affect the finished product at all.  I did add the juice and zest of one key lime to the frosting, which was fantastic.  I just can't get over how moist this cake is!!  It's so delicious, that my parrot, Merlin, and I were fighting over the scraps on the edges of the pan!  Thanks for posting, Syd!  Made for PRMR Tag."
860079,370976,2011-07-22,5,"This was a MARVELOUS cake! I made as directed, using gluten-free flour and neufchatel cheese. I did add 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice to the frosting and used the toasted coconut. I think I'll add more lime juice to the cake batter next time, as I couldn't really taste it - the banana flavor was most prominent. I made this for a lady at work for her birthday and everyone loved it - not overly sweet but with exotic flavors. My husband got a small piece of it and really loved it so I'll have to make him his own cake. I definitely like this recipe - it was easy to make and the flavor is outstanding and so different from most cakes. Thanks for posting Syd - we loved it.

1677099,370976,2011-11-21,5,"VERY moist, almost like pudding.  Tasty.  As I had no plain flour, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 rice flour.  Used white vinegar to generate my buttermilk.  Since I accidentally put all the coconut in the cake and used  another 1/3 cup for top.  Added lime zest and juice to icing....and another cup of powdered sugar.  I like the extra coconut in the cake.  Next time I might try zest of 2 limes in the cake.  Adding the zest and juice to the icing really served this cake well."
595403,254360,2007-09-23,2,"it took way too long to bake more then 2hours. but the honey and butter tasted pretty good ,my mom in law loved it . thanks"
225722,254360,2008-07-28,5,"Excellent recipe.  Yummy and sweet.  I had no problem with the cooking time.  It was done at the end of the 45 minutes, but I put it in an extra 10 min for extra softness.  I appreciate the use of honey instead of sugar.  thanks"
47559,170336,2006-06-07,5,"I found a new cookie for my favorites cookie cookbook.  These are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and pack a wonderful spice flavor.  Very pretty and sparkly from the sugar crystals.  I don't really care for the taste of molasses, and tried Louisiana ribbon cane syrup instead.  It has the same color and texture, and a taste that is similar to the thick Dutch syrup I remember.  It worked beautifully in this cookie.  Thanks so much for posting this winner that will be made again and again."
145352,170336,2006-06-12,5,"SOOOOOOOOOO excellent!!!!! Thanks CIH!!!! But I have no idea how you got so many cookies! I ended up with 28....maybe I made them too big, but we loved them. A definite keeper!"
175492,170336,2006-06-16,5,"Ditto to Charmie's comments.  These are soooo darned good, and even make the house smell good while baking.  I used Black Strap Molasses, we really like molasses here, and these were the best.  Will be adding these to my cookies for gift making too as I am certain everyone will appreciate a box of these.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  The Dirty Pan Gang RULES!!!"
63335,170336,2007-01-14,5,"I loved these!  I had to make them last minute, and i didn't have any ground cloves...but they turned out great!  I will make these again!"
457690,170336,2007-05-26,5,"LOVED these. I only made half a recipe so the dough was very wet seeing that I couldn't really ""half"" an egg hehehe. I didn't have any molasses so I used pure maple syurp and they still tasted soooo good. I also sprinkled in a little cayenne pepper to give it an extra kick. 

Because the dough was so wet they spread like crazy so the cookies were super thin but I still thought they were excellent! I will for sure make these again!"
548608,170336,2007-08-23,5,"I have looked for years for the cookies my best friend's Mom made when we were kids ... Spicy Crinkles they were called.  These cookies are exactly what I have been looking for.  I made them thin and crispy and I, and my whole family LOVED them.  They didn't last long!"
44420,170336,2007-09-16,4,"Great cookie!  I added some ground cloves and ground mace because I was in the mood for them.  The cookie has nice texture - crisp outside, soft inside."
61525,170336,2007-12-09,5,"These cookies came out delicious!  Mine came out very chewy because I accidently added the whole 1 1/2 cups of sugar to the cookie mixture instead of reserving the 1/2 cup for rolling balls in...yumm......!  I'll make these again and again!

Thanks for posting!  :)

868673,170336,2008-08-22,5,"My DH took these to work every day for over a week and he asked me to make them again.  For him to tell me he likes something is unusual, so I knew he must have REALLY liked them a lot!  I made following the recipe exactly and the result was a crispy on the outside, chewy inside delicious cookie that we both really liked!  I can see why they won 1st place!  Roni"
31316,170336,2008-12-07,5,These are awesome cookies!  I added a bit of mace and allspice to mine and they are excellent.  Thank you very much for sharing your recipe.
426156,170336,2008-12-30,5,"This is an excellent spice cookie - crispy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.  I added a little allspice, and will also try some cardamom next time.  I just gave these a light roll through colored sugar (making some red and some green for Christmas) instead of coating them with regular sugar.  Because colored sugar is usually more coarse than granulated sugar, I find it leaves a gritty texture if the cookie is completely coated in it.  Thanks for a very good recipe."
1800179196,501408,2013-11-02,1,"This was a fail for me!  Maybe because I used a handmixer, but I ended up with something very much resembling scrambled eggs and looking absolutely nothing like a pancake!"
2766292,501408,2013-07-16,5,"Try it , won&#039;t regret it!!!"
341486,501408,2013-07-20,1,"Sorry, this was not for me at all.  Tasted like a thin banana omelette. After I&#039;d made a few and the family all pulled faces I added flour, baking powder and milk to the remaining batter and made pancakes out of that.  They said the first ones had no &quot;bite&quot; to them."
2941555,501408,2013-08-12,5,"These are great, the kids love them! Mom and dad too!"
2958004,501408,2013-08-24,5,Very nice :)
1800042747,501408,2013-09-02,3,After reading some other reviews I thought what the heck. I added 1/2tsp of vanilla. The first few bites were interesting but soon after knew it was a banana omelette!! LOL Still worth a try just to say you did!! :)
1800044428,501408,2013-09-03,3,"I thought these were very good, for what they are.  I did add vanilla extract, just to give them a nicer flavor.  Will definitely be making these again."
1800258076,501408,2013-11-16,3,"Try adding only one egg and use yellow banana. Not overripe. You will have thin eggy pancakes with a too sweet banana flavor. Also, use minimal spray or oil as these can easily become too greasy. If they are too thin, a tbsp of flour will help."
1801221164,501408,2013-12-24,5,I put 1/2 tsp of Vanilla Extract
1802411092,501408,2014-01-25,5,"love! added vanilla. blended in bullet quick. very thin, cooked in butter. awesome! i don&#039;t mind the &#039;eggy&#039; flavor. needs no sweetener."
1802423641,501408,2014-01-28,5,So yummy...need to add cinnamon though!
1802430546,501408,2014-01-29,5,Turned out better than I expected. Definitely making again.
1802527471,501408,2014-02-25,4,"Added vanilla essence as per other reviews, also (on a second run) added 1 1/2 tsp of unsweetened cocoa. The result was pleasingly chocolatey, though it did need a little bit of extra sweetness added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There&#039;s probably a disconnect between US and UK pancakes here - UK (though not Scottish) pancakes are usually quite thin, closer to crepes, US pancakes tend to be thicker. These will turn out thinner, like a UK pancake."
1384367,501408,2014-03-05,4,"I make these &quot;pancakes&quot; for my babies and they love them. (And these are the babies who throw scrambled eggs on the floor and drive their mother crazy by not eating protein.) They are thin and a bit eggy, though, so I&#039;ve got to go with four stars because they aren&#039;t really like pancakes. If you&#039;re looking for traditional pancakes, go elsewhere. Overall, these were a success! I recommend them for anyone with toddlers."
1802653462,501408,2014-04-08,1,This was very earthy to me; it need sugar or something.
42462903,501408,2014-06-20,5,"My daughter, who does not like eggs and never opts for protein, loved these.  They did not need extra sugar as you are going to put syrup anyway.  I would next time as per other reviewers try some cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla or banana extract.  But just as is was great for my 5 year old."
11395289,501408,2014-09-09,5,"This is a go to recipe for our house!  My toddler loves these and she typically doesn&#039;t like eggs!  We add 1/2 tsp of vanilla, sprinkle of cinnamon and a tsp of Sunflower Butter  (peanut butter).  We make in the morning and my husband and I take them in the car and eat on way to work, our daughter eats them with jam or sometimes syrup.  We made this with a potato masher... plus it was fun for our daughter to help."
1803298711,501408,2014-11-03,4,"For these pancakes I ended up blending the two ingredients making a very smooth and fluffy batter. Then continuing to add cinnamon, Salt and vanilla extract. Personally these worked very well considering I have a gluten-free diet they were fast and easy and very yummy. Don&#039;t make these pancakes thinking that they&#039;ll taste like wheat pancakes. With these pancakes I added peanut butter which pair nicely with the bananas."
11800120,501408,2014-12-02,3,Wait. I wrote an earlier review but forgot to say that I did one to one ratio.  One banana to one egg.  It was perfect.
1803680891,501408,2015-01-19,5,"This is a super quick, super easy, super healthy recipe that helps satisfy my pancake craving. Yes these are very thin a lot more similar to crepes so don&#039;t make these expecting your typical fluffy buttermilk pancakes. To enhance the flavor I also add a little vanilla extract and cinnamon to the mix. To help with the texture whip the eggs well before incorporating with the bananas and also add a little baking powder. This will make it a little fluffier. Finally I throw in a tsp of chia seeds to up the health factor and serve with a little maple syrup. Yummm."
1803739347,501408,2015-02-02,5,Excellant. Taste really good &amp; gave me my pancake fix without blowing my carbs for the whole day. They are best cooked slow &amp; watch for burning. Second side cooks very quickly.
2000085148,501408,2015-03-24,5,"Quick. Healthy. Delicious. Packed with protein and energy! As a student, this is an enrichment in my morning routine."
2000111149,501408,2015-04-03,1,Tastes like a banana omelette.
2000113837,501408,2015-04-04,5,"Loved this. Tasty with just the right amount of sweetness. I doubled the recipe and took away one egg, so I used two bananas and two eggs and it was perfect. Added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of ground up flax seeds to up the health content. Delicious!"
2000119862,501408,2015-04-05,1,"Well this was just disappointing. I don&#039;t know what I really expected but it tasted like banana and egg. Like another review said banana omelet, so just imagine adding bananas to your omelet which no one would and you have an idea of how this tastes. To be honest just cook the eggs and have the banana on the side much better and quicker! I don&#039;t eat pancakes often and this is a poor substitute. I&#039;d rather eat real fluffy thick pancakes smothered with butter and syrup once a year than make this again. People who gave this good reviews have obviously not had real pancakes in sometime."
2000134188,501408,2015-04-12,5,"delicious!!! they weren&#039;t too thick and i could finish the whole plate and i was full, not miserable, afterwards. i added a pinch of brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract by default, b/c that&#039;s what i do out of habit whenever i make pancakes. so yummy!"
2000187002,501408,2015-05-05,0,"Love this recipe! I also add vanilla paste or essence, cinnamon and berries at the end on top as well of youghut. I am on a health kick and this is the perfect, quick easy and yummy breakfast"
2000214796,501408,2015-05-20,4,"I found the one banana, two eggs was too runny. So I added another banana, and it was great! I also added a splash of cinnamon. Keep the pancakes small and they cook better too."
2000215790,501408,2015-05-21,4,"This is so delicious! I must agree that it is a little flat, but in all honesty it&#039;s healthiness outweighs it&#039;s appearance. Lactose &amp; gluten free! Will definitely be recommending it to all of my food intolerant friends :)"
2000222870,501408,2015-05-24,5,Loved these! Tasted just like normal pancakes which surprised me and my sister. I made a raspberry coulis to go with them and they were so good! Will definitely make these a lot more. Plus they&#039;re a much healthier alternative! Thanks!
2000226627,501408,2015-05-25,5,Very easy to make tasted just like a pancake. I used a food processor to blend smooth and also added some organic raw honey. Very nice recipe. Thanks.
2000260587,501408,2015-06-10,3,Doesn&#039;t taste bad! Especially if you add some vanilla extract and cinnamon but the texture.... Mine turned out looking like scrambled eggs. If you can ignore the looks and focus on the taste then it&#039;s for u!
2000261110,501408,2015-06-10,3,"I&#039;m not sure why would any one call this a &quot;pancake&quot;; I agree this is more like a sweet banana omelette or a banana crepe. It&#039;s not terrible, a bit plain in my opinion. It needs some fruit, honey, nutella,peanut butter  or nuts (or what ever you like) to enhace its flavor, otherwise it tastes as a banana omelette. I agree with other review I read earlier, who ever called them &quot;pancakes&quot; has not eaten real pancakes in a while. Still not bad, but I preffer to make mine like a crepe with something inside next time."
2000280265,501408,2015-06-19,5,"Mine turned out amazing!
I tweaked it a bit.. 
2 eggs
1 banana
Tbsp of weight control maple brown syrup oatmeal (Quaker)

Topped it with strawberries and a tsp of maple syrup"
2000287799,501408,2015-06-22,4,"Overall, I love these pancakes! They are healthy and easy, not to mention they taste great. The only things I can say about them is that they are super hard to flip, but once you get the hang of it, it&#039;s magic!
Also, I recommend using a blender instead of hand-mixing the ingredients and using honey and fruit to top it for a healthier alternative to maple syrup. And instead of using PAM, use coconut oil to rub across the pan.
I am about to make them right now again and I am going to put some cinnamon in it for extra flavor.
Have a nice day!"
2000340556,501408,2015-07-15,5,Absolutely love these pancakes. My family eats them up and asks for more.
2000383049,501408,2015-08-04,1,"It works sure, and if banana and egg is your thing then it will be great for you!
But for me it was a weird combination and the spongy omelette consistency was far from &#039;crepe like&#039;. 
Perhaps my egg to banana ratio was off?"
2000420418,501408,2015-08-22,5,Great way to get rid of overripe bananas. Classic breakfast in my home :)
368043,501408,2015-08-31,4,"I have made these a few times and really enjoy them.   Although I did alter the recipe a bit.  First, I only use one egg for one banana.  And then I add a tablespoon of flour for just a little bulk.  They taste like pancakes to me with these two changes."
2000449728,501408,2015-09-02,4,This recipe is great if you are trying to loose weight as a healthy and low calorie snack. However 2 eggs make it taste to eggy. One egg to one large/medium banana is just fine. Especially if you want to keep the sweet taste of the banana.
1801553725,501408,2015-09-12,1,"Terrible texture, terrible taste.  Worse with syrup.  Don&#039;t waste your ingredients.  This will never pass as a pancake."
2000474827,501408,2015-09-14,5,"I Love these pancakes -- I originally saw the recipe on Pinterest but that one added cinnamon to the mix and I really think that makes a difference. It gives it more flavor and the pancakes come out a little more brownish and looking like regular pancakes. Anyway, they are light, delicious and the kids and I love them. One piece of advice would be to be sure they are firmed up before trying to flip them or it will fall apart and not look so nice. So cook it mostly on the one side, the flip and cook for just 20-30 seconds on the other side."
2000526525,501408,2015-10-05,5,"I added Cinnamon and Vanilla to the mix, cooked them well on the griddle and they tasted very good. I topped with a bit of peanut butter and honey. Perfect for a light breakfast! My son loves them. He&#039;s 8 months and literally inhaled them."
2000540454,501408,2015-10-09,1,"I am sorry, but this didn&#039;t work for me at all. It looked like banana scrambled eggs. To not waste the ingredients I threw half of the banana/egg mix to some complete buttermilk pancake mix I had home and added some water to soften the mix. I ended with a fairly good pancake. It was a bit too fluffy because I added baking powder to the banana/egg mix but at least it was edible."
2000431901,501408,2015-10-30,5,"These were great! We whipped the eggs really well first, then added the banana and used the blender to make it totally smooth. Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. They were similar enough to real pancakes, a wonderful grain free substitute. So sweet from the banana that they didn&#039;t need syrup, we just topped them with chopped kiwi and strawberries. My two year old actually did all the work except the cooking, and gobbled three of them down."
2000648966,501408,2015-11-07,4,Adding a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder helps make them more of the consistency of a regular pancake. I also add a little vanilla and cinnamon. You can even throw in some choc chips tho that obviously detracts a bit from the healthiness. :)
2000688081,501408,2015-11-17,4,"A ratio of one egg to one banana is definitely the way to go. Delicious banana flavor, no need for syrup. I had trouble flipping them, they tend to fall apart. Cook over lower heat and use a lid."
2001061706,501408,2016-06-24,1,"If you like scrambled eggs with bananas mixed right in, this recipe is for you. The egg to banana ratio is too high."
2001102034,501408,2016-07-25,3,"It tastes really great but I found the batter really thin, so when it came to flipping the pancakes they just fell apart - it would work better for pancake bites than full sized pancakes :)"
2001084886,501408,2016-09-13,5,I make these pancakes all of the time. They are great and low calorie. We top with fresh sliced strawberries and a dot of cool whip.
1801189345,501408,2016-10-24,5,"Made these this morning and I was pleasantly surprised. Didn't know what to expect. Used recipe, as is, with no additions. My husband loved them, too. What is easier than two eggs and a banana on a griddle? Healthy, quick, and no mess."
2001354586,501408,2017-01-16,0,"Was ok, even one egg and one banana was still too runny, added some pancake mix to it. First pancake was ok, 2nd and third from the mix were better. Next time I will try 3 bananas and 2 eggs. 1.5 banana to 1 egg seems like a better ratio."
2001362345,501408,2017-01-22,4,"We didn't have any of the problems others are listing here when made as the recipe directed. We made sure the griddle was nice and hot, and we used about 2 Tablespoons of &quot;batter&quot; per pancake -- no problems flipping. Worked great, tasted great. Added a little maple syrup to a few of them, but the blend of banana and maple flavors was weird to my palate, and it didn't need it. I tweaked the next batch to a 1:1 ratio and added cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla. I liked the consistency better on the 2nd batch."
2001364700,501408,2017-01-24,4,I adjusted the recipe: - 1 ripe banana - 1 egg - 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract - 3 tablespoons flour Topped with crunchy peanut butter and/or syrup. Very tasty and easy!
2001368868,501408,2017-01-28,4,This was amazing!!!!! I didn't whisk the eggs enough though :( My bad.... lol
2001377865,501408,2017-02-04,4,"I am a big fan of these. I stay away from refined sugar, but that doesn't mean I don't still crave it. I used a bit of vanilla, a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and a tablespoon of powdered peanut butter with added protein. They taste like Peanut butter cup pancakes. My five year old requests them and will eat four or five in a sitting, so I call it a win with the added ingredients."
2001381315,501408,2017-02-06,3,"I did the 1 egg to 1 banana ratio. I added vanilla, milk, and some nuts to the batter. Made it into a roll and added peanut butter. Tasted great."
2001391802,501408,2017-02-14,5,I don't even like eggs and I loved this!! I did the one banana and two eggs ratio and I added fruit on top and drizzled a little honey on top.... It was amazing!!!
2001396405,501408,2017-02-18,2,"It tasted like a weird french toast with banana instead of bread. The egg to banana ratio was definitely off. Also, the texture did not resemble a pancake."
2001399441,501408,2017-02-20,0,I use a mixer and 1/8 tsp baking powder... makes a big difference in texture!
1790123,501408,2017-02-23,5,"Best pancakes ever! So sweet, addictive, and easy. I added a dash of salt, cinnamon, and vanilla."
1803589550,501408,2017-03-02,5,I made these but added a teaspoon of plain flour for texture. I also added raisins as they were cooking.
2001436774,501408,2017-03-15,5,I eat these every few days. I add cinnamon to the mix and then add honey on top when done. I love these. A few blueberries or sliced banana goes a long way too! Everyone I make these for loves them and such a good breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!
2001437598,501408,2017-03-15,5,"Tastes awesome! Used 1 egg 1 banana, pinch of baking powder and cinnamon sugar. Blended in a smoothie mixer. Touch of maple syrup on top! Didn't taste eggy at all :)"
2001443744,501408,2017-03-18,0,"I love this recipe. It's not as dry as a pancake, more like you said, a pudding, therefore I don't need to add any syrup of any sort. My husband has type 2 diabetes, so this is about as close as we can come to a bread, which we can't have on our Kenogeyics diet. It's delicious!"
2001467861,501408,2017-04-02,5,"we were looking for something sweet and decided to make these odd pancakes,they were to thin, so we put oatmeal in it,but it all turned out as mush!"
2001476275,501408,2017-04-07,2,The picture CANNOT be from these 'pancakes'. I agree with the banana omelette stories. It got two stars for creativity.
2001484054,501408,2017-04-12,5,omg i love these... i added about a teaspoon and a half of baking powder and made a little larger pancakes... also did not flip them just put them under the broiler to finish them off... i have made these about a hundred times since finding the recipe and they are fabulous... i wouldnt thank you for original pancakes now :)
2001488417,501408,2017-04-14,5,"Love these little gems. Quick, easy and tasty"
2001516589,501408,2017-05-01,3,"The first time I tried this, I ended up with something similar to scrambled banana eggs. The second time, I used a firm banana and whipped the egg whites. Perfection! The recipe as stands uses a ripe or mushy banana. When you use a firmer one and whip the whites, your pancake is similar to a pancake and holds together well"
2001523517,501408,2017-05-06,4,It is a quick and easy healthy breakfast good for kids. Toppings are optional but the sweetness from the bannana is good enough. One little thing sometimes adding flour can help
2001539151,501408,2017-05-15,0,I love these. If you add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder they puff up like real pancakes. Does anyone know what you can substitute the banana with for a savory option?
2001600960,501408,2017-06-26,5,"Not to be dramatic, but this banana pancake recipe changed my life. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon but besides that, this recipe was perfect! If you whisk the eggs thoroughly before adding the mashed banana, the finished product is super light and fluffy. You'll need a lot of cooking spray, however, because they're harder to flip than regular pancakes."
2001604614,501408,2017-06-29,5,"The recipe is great! The pancakes take much much less time than regular pancakes, and the final product feels much 'lighter' - it's more similar to thin pancakes than the English fluffy pancakes. Tastes great. Small tweaks/advice: - I used 1 egg, 1 banana + a bit of baking powder as seen in the comments. I also used a hand-held mixer to get an even consistency. I got two small pancakes out of that. They can be hard to flip as the top does not set, so making your pancakes smaller and flipping them quickly will avoid spillage. They really do need only about 30sec per side, but if you leave them on a bit too long you can't taste the difference, even if they look very dark on the surface."
2001604721,501408,2017-06-29,1,I know everyone is different but these were not what I expected
2001606241,501408,2017-06-30,0,"well, I tried it with the one egg and cinnamon but it didn't fry up nice into a pancake. I added the other egg and made it into banana scrambled eggs. Not bad, even good and low cal. Thumbs up!!"
2001606295,501408,2017-06-30,5,These were fluffy and delish! I would say the trick is to smash the banana but not to whip them with a blender or anything. I left a little texture and the were very good and fluffy.
2001607225,501408,2017-07-01,4,Great idea and overall outcome nothing like pancakes burning enjoyed it great for after training
2001542623,501408,2017-07-24,5,"I read all of the comments, and decided to use 1/2 banana and 1 egg. I added 3/4 tsp of baking powder and 2 good shakes of cinnamon. I ate 1/2 of the banana. I whipped the egg, then mashed the other 1/2 of the banana into the egg. Let it sit for a few minutes! I tried making smaller pancakes, but they ran into each other, so I made a lunch plate sized pancake. I was not interested in a banana omelet, so I flipped it, twice. I enjoyed this with some sugar free maple syrup. Now considering making more, and refrigerating it to make pancakes for tomorrow...so many bananas, so many recipes to try."
2001827830,501408,2017-11-27,5,"This is a great GF recipe, and what I loved was it did not have too much of a banana taste. If you've processed the bananas instead of mashing then you will not have the correct consistency. I've added touches of cinnamon when I want it to be a bit more of a French Toast taste; peanut butter to add a bit of fun, etc. Love this recipe &amp; so glad I found it!"
2001878400,501408,2017-12-22,5,"These are amazing! my little man loved them! he ate them and was asking for more. I also had them. yummy! i added a little cinnamon to the batter and made fresh whipped cream instead of using syrup. huge hit in my house and can't wait to make them again! i did learn that spraying the pan, even though its a Gothic non-stick pan, is very important. After that, they were easier to flip. I had to leave them in the pan on medium heat for a little more than a minute to get them cooked enough to flip, instead of 30 sec like the recipe said. again, we loved them and can't wait to make them again!!"
2001953175,501408,2018-01-25,2,Wouldn't stay together impossible to flip...this one is disappointing
2001985409,501408,2018-02-11,1,An inedible mess and a ruined pan.
2002029045,501408,2018-03-04,1,Tasted like a banana omelette....
2000040925,501408,2018-03-08,5,"As I read the title of this recipe, I must admit I was skeptical about it really resembling/tasting like “pancakes”. I read through each review, tweak, and decided to try it first with just the banana and egg, and the next time with a bit of cinnamon and baking powder added. Both were yummy, hit that crave for a pancake! I do enjoy the “tweaked” version better. (Fluffier). They are sweet enough to forego syrup, sweeteners. This is perfect for the crowd looking for gluten free, low point alternative (zero freestyle point/weight watcher) pancake. If you are accustomed to eating pancakes made with flour, it should be no shock that these would be different. Move on people."
2002151096,501408,2018-05-13,0,"I have Ulcerative Colitis and strictly follow the SCD lifestyle, which is completely grain and refined sugar free. I'm always looking for ways to meet my caloric intake for the day and these are amazing. I used an immersion blender to whisk the eggs until they were slightly frothy, added the banana and a few tablespoons of finely shredded coconut, then continued to blend until smooth. Turned out great and I didn't need any additional syrups or sweeteners!"
2002084634,501408,2018-05-16,0,Have been making it for quite some time now. Grandchildren love it - so do the rest of the family!
2001091055,501408,2018-07-16,2,"I really wanted to like these. The consistency is too wet and I only used a 1:1 ratio instead of 2 eggs like the written recipe. I ended up adding milk, baking powder, and flour (sparingly) and they couldn't be saved. :("
2002221438,501408,2018-07-17,1,That was the grossest thing I’ve ever made. It tasted like sweet eggs. ??
2002269212,501408,2018-09-08,0,My sister gave me this idea and I decided to try it today. It is quick and easy and the result is very good. I added some uncooked oatmeal to the banana and egg mixture and let it sit for a few minutes before proceeding to cook the small pancakes. I used ONE egg and ONE medium banana.
636338,427714,2010-07-07,5,I made this to go with some oven baked chicken I was making.  It was a great change from stuffing and we really liked it!  I left out the almonds.
1800796404,427714,2013-12-15,5,It was good even without the onions ( i didn&#039;t have any).  I will be making it again
746803,403149,2010-04-05,5,I had friends over for brunch today and made this with freshly picked (yesterday) field mushrooms.  I preprepared the mushrooms the night before and then heated them and melted the cheese just before serving them. Still tasted fantastic. I made them for PAC Spring 2010
224622,403149,2011-06-06,5,Just made this for lunch and it was awesome.  My youngest begged for more and she doesn't even really like mushrooms!
452940,246688,2008-06-16,5,"This is a wonderful, wonderful jam! I reduced the amount using 4 apricots (1 cup) and 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 lemon (we love lemons)! This would have yeilded about 1/2 cup (read on). I was tasting each time I stirred after the first 20 minutes. Unfortunately, I didn't get a photo as other things had needed urgency, so I turned it down to low, but it wound up over-cooked to something that resembled caramel but the color of molasses. I am so glad I tasted it as I went along, it is very, very yummy, and nothing beats homemade! I look forward to making this again (and not over-cooking) as it started out so perfectly yummy for us. A final note; since this is so simple to make such a small amount at a time, unless gift giving or storing for when apricots are out of season, you can just whip this up the day before serving. :)"
1082902,246688,2008-12-18,5,this is delicious!!! it has a nice tang to it which I think most apricot jams lack.  I used 2nd grade apricots and made a small batch first and am now making a big batch as it turned out so nice.
1450361,406507,2010-01-21,5,"OMG, what a recipe! Thanks for sharing. My husband is a big fan of pecans. Delicious. Going to try mixing in walnuts for me, I'm not really a fan of pecans."
424680,406507,2010-02-05,5,"With just one exception, I followed this recipe right on down, though I used not quite as much of the Tabasco sauce as indicated! Still, they were not enough for us & next time I'd like to double or triple the recipe & include them on the next finger food counter I set up for a monthly group that I host ~ They'd love 'em, too! [Made & reviewed in New Kids on the Block tag]"
1543878,406507,2010-02-06,1,"If I could give half a star, I would. Way too greasy, cut butter in half. Way too salty. Don't add any extra. Soy sauce? Try teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce instead. Add a sprinkle of garlic powder. Pecans are so naturally sweet and delicately flavored, why bury them in a greasy, salty mess? I'm from Arkansas and we'd never abuse a pecan like this."
720912,330290,2014-03-19,5,"Thanks so much for posting- I didn&#039;t know how to cook the Kale which I bought, and this recipe did the trick. The Kale came out delicious."
263275,140486,2005-12-24,5,"This is a great recipe. Simple and easy to make. Works great on hot, freh baked cinnamon rolls!  I just used it for that tonight"
278218,140486,2006-03-25,5,Very easy! I made it with Oreo Pound cake recipe #153343 and it worked fabulous! I melted it in the microwave so it was pourable. Thanks!
206616,140486,2006-07-29,4,"This was an easy frosting that worked well on cupcakes. If you want a smooth finish, try this: After spreading the somewhat stiff frosting evenly on the cake or cupcakes, smooth it out with a metal frosting spreader. Periodically rinse the spreader under hot running water (without drying it off), allowing the moisture on the speader to work it's magic. If you want a delicious tasting frosting, there are much better recipes out there. But, if you are just searching for something to ice a cake, cupcakes, cinnamon rolls* or oatmeal cookies*, this one works well.  I sparingly frosted 18 cupcakes with one batch of this recipe.
*Add extra milk to the mix, one drop at a time, to make it thin enough for this purpose."
328030,140486,2006-08-17,2,"for some reason when we made this frosting, it was very runny. we follwed the directions, so i'm not sure what went wrong"
224566,140486,2006-11-02,5,This icing is wonderful! It worked great to frost some brownies I made!
304419,140486,2007-01-01,5,I made this tonight for my strawberry cake and it was so easy to do. I added the frosting while the cake was still warm so it would drizzle down the sides.
423241,140486,2007-01-05,5,"Very easy,and tast's great!"
467615,140486,2007-03-18,4,"great recipe, but the does the age of the vanilla affect the quality of the frosting?:)"
572038,140486,2007-08-27,3,"Okay- first of all- the amount was tiny!! so i made two, but i mixed it into the same bowl, and it turned out very thin. but, for the taste, it was excellent. i would definitely make it again."
696844,140486,2008-06-28,0,Perfect and exactly the right amount! I usually just eye it but this was much easier!
230258,140486,2009-11-08,5,"This was exactly what i was looking for as i used it for Cookies 'n Creme Cake - Super Easy
Recipe #200993. I had to add a little more milk to get the consistency that i wanted, but that is understandable! Thanks for the simple icing recipe!"
487909,281316,2008-02-28,5,Love-Love-Love IT!!! So tasty and sweet!!  Thanks!!
613381,281316,2008-12-10,4,"The only olive oil I had was extra virgin which seemed overpowering in this so I ended up skimming quite a bit from the dressing as it cooled.  This tells me it could be made with less oil and still be delicious.  Served with a simple salad of shredded romaine, green onion, celery, and sesame seeds."
195750,281316,2009-11-11,5,"Used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and didn't have enough red wine vinegar, so I used mostly rice wine vinegar.  Overall, it's the best Asian dressing that I've made so far.  The family really liked it, too!"
1342431,140486,2010-02-04,5,"Yummy!  This is so delicious.  The perfect frosting for any use.  Just notice that it makes 1 cup of frosting, which is just what I needed.  But you may need to double the recipe to frost a whole cake."
1550020,140486,2010-02-12,2,"Yuck..
This frosting is too thick too sweet."
226066,140486,2010-02-28,5,Delicious!! Easy and all ingredients I had on hand! Used to frost recipe #411186. Thanks Delish!
1603669,140486,2010-04-24,1,TERRIBLE dosen't work or spread properly dont make it!
1637616,140486,2010-06-20,5,"Thank you, thank you for keeping it so simple!  A really tasty recipe that i improvised upon by adding a little cocoa powder to for a quick and easy chocolate frosting!  Thanks again, we loved it!"
1764015,140486,2010-12-17,0,"Amazing!! I had all the ingredients here at home and it was quick and easy! To the people who didn't like it and said it was too thick, try adding a little more milk and mixing more!"
1884489,140486,2011-04-15,5,This recipe is perfect for an 8x8 pan of brownies. I added some melted chocolate chips and a teaspoon of peppermint extract and it is so good. My sister thought it was a new store bought frosting. It's really smooth and creamy.
2212312,140486,2012-03-15,5,"thank you so very much for this recipe. o.k., i just have one thing to say, this frosting was simply superb. very easy and quick to make. and tasty too.  now why would some people say it was to sweet.not true at all. it was perfect for us. the second time i made it, i did add 1 more tbsp of milk to thin it out...made like a glaze. yum!"
2244887,140486,2012-04-21,1,"I tried this with my friend, did everything preoperly and it was gross. It tasted almost like nothing and made me want to puke. We tried adding more of each ingrediant after our initial trial and it made it a bit better but still gross. It was the grossest thing in the world. I hope yours worked. But this tasted  gross."
2261116,140486,2012-05-10,5,wow great i goes great with lemon cupcakes and i would totally make it again simple and easy and donn't forget delicious!!!
2285809,140486,2012-06-06,3,"This is a decent recipe for the time and ingredients required.<br/>  Those who are complaining about the thickness must not have used an electric mixer, which is a necessity for light and fluffy confections.  It was still a bit thick and powdery, and did not yield enough for my 2-layer cake, so I quadrupled the recipe, and then added a splash more of milk (about 1-2 tbs more) to the mix.  It was still a bit powdery, but it worked well with my strawberry cake.  For those of you using this on drier cakes, try adding even more milk to the mix."
2291220,140486,2012-06-11,4,simple easy recipe. Decent considering time spent and simple ingredients
2324490,140486,2012-07-10,3,Nice and simple. But also VERY powdered sugary-ie needed a little more butter. And Cream Cheese to make it perfect.
2328687,140486,2012-07-14,5,love it
2404919,140486,2012-09-16,3,"I tried this recipe he other day and right away I knew that there was WAY to much powdered sugar in it. So when I made this frosting, I cut the sugar in half and added a few drops of almond extract to give it a little flavor. Everyone loved it after I added the extract and I will probably use it again."
2445425,140486,2012-10-11,0,it was great but a little crunchy and we needed to add more taste so we added 2 table spoons of whiped topping 6 onces of mix whipped cream and a stick more of butter
2772340,140486,2013-04-06,5,"Many people how found this recipe to be too thick and I agree but for an easy fix, just add more milk. There has been many complaints about this recipe and I think that is unfair. The recipe was fine and delicious especially for a frosting at a beginner standard! The recipe said simple in the tidal so that it would be good to eat and easy to make. For something this great most people have been giving it a very hard time! Easy is not made to be the best thing you ever tasted and you wanted something easy. If you don&#039;t like it, then it&#039;s your fault for choosing it!"
2777967,140486,2013-04-11,4,"For a powdered sugar recipe, I really wasn&#039;t expecting much. I couldn&#039;t drive to the store, so I figured it was worth a shot. I normally don&#039;t add the butter or margarine variation though, so this was a thrilling experiment. I was pleasantly surprised by the texture and flavor of this frosting. It had a nice medium-paint-thick consistency (definitely not in the glaze category as most powdered sugar icings are). It was smooth as ironed sheets and had a nice sugary-vanilla flavor. I refrigerated the leftover frosting, and I think I liked it better cold for breakfast this morning. The color was a little off due to the vanilla extract, but food coloring could fix that if you are all fancy and stuff. I paired this frosting with an easy cupcake recipe, found here: http://www.food.com/recipe/simple-white-cupcakes-172550"
1975315,140486,2013-05-06,5,It was perfect!  I needed a fast easy straight forward recipe that I could do before school for the kids one day - This saved me a trip to the market!  The texture was good and the taste was perfect!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;YEAH!
2849097,140486,2013-06-02,0,"I made this with all the ingredients and it tasted like pure powder sugar! I did everything it said! (Not much! :p) I had to throw it away though! The weird thing is, I made this recipe with my cousin last night and it tasted delicious! I did the same thing as last night! I don&#039;t know what went wrong!"
1431296,140486,2013-06-06,2,"Might be fine to drizzle on donuts but not all the cake frosting i was looking for. Added extra vanilla and half a package of cream cheese trying to cover up the starchy flavor of the powdered sugar. Did not work at all. I finally gave up, froze it for another use and bought frosting in a can. So much for homemade."
2927095,140486,2013-08-01,0,My Mom and I have used this recipe for at least 50 years...never had a  problem
2928276,140486,2013-08-02,3,I loved this frosting because it was so easy to make and very yummy! However I&#039;m not sure if I did something wrong with mine or its just the type of frosting but mines began to melt fairly quickly. I also live in Hawaii and it&#039;s about 80 degrees in my house..besides the melting problem this is a great go to frosting! A little too sweet for my grandmother but I love it!
1800061001,140486,2013-09-15,4,"This recipe was really easy to make when I was in a pinch. All the ingredients were readily available. I didn&#039;t measure that great, so at first it was a little thin, but I just slowly added more icing sugar until it hung onto the beating paddle longer, a good way to test your &quot;clingability&quot;.  I think I&#039;ll also try this substituting a little peppermint for the vanilla when frosting chocolate. Thanks for sharing. It was great for cupcakes."
1800066885,140486,2013-09-19,3,This frosting is super duper sweet so I recommend you add about three heaping dollops of sour cream. It is much nicer then. I like the simplicity of it though.
1800075313,140486,2013-09-24,0,I would not recommend this frosting. I followed the directions and it turned out to be very runny. Put it in the freezer to see if it would thicken up some; still didn&#039;t work. I was very disappointed in it. I would not try this again!
1800079824,140486,2013-10-03,5,"This frosting is actually very good.  The consistency is just right for the cake i wanted to frost.  I had all the ingredients, but not enough to make a full batch.  I changed the serving size and used the converted measurements, it worked out great."
1800144176,140486,2013-10-22,4,Yummy yummy I needed to add extra sugar because it was way too runny. It came out like cinnamon roll glaze but with the added sugar it was perfect.
2471961,140486,2013-11-01,4,"Extremely sweet, but after all, there are 2 cups of powdered sugar in this. If you like the sweet frostings, you&#039;ll like this. I, myself, like a less sweet frosting, but needed a frosting and had all the required ingredients for this. I can&#039;t give 5 stars b/c the frosting didn&#039;t act like a frosting at all. It was very crumbly until I added extra milk. I added about another tablespoon and used my electric mixer to mix until everything stiffened up. Overall, it is a good recipe, but the milk certainly needs increased. *side note* make sure to use an electric mixer for this. Mixing by hand will not give the desired consistency."
1800297810,140486,2013-11-23,0,THIS IS TERRIBLE NEVER TRY IT !!!!!!!!! it made my icing hard as rock it was not even near being fluffy and it was like popcorn I don&#039;t know how this worked for anybody so take my advice and don&#039;t do it your wasting your own time!!!
1800395306,140486,2013-12-03,5,This is more of an ICING not a frosting. Ice your gingerbread men in this... Absolutely perfect.
1800749124,140486,2013-12-14,5,Very yummy I frosted 20 cupcakes and my hole family liked it. It had the right consistency but I little to sweet. I only put 1 1/2 cups of powder sugar because it is really sweet. This frosting is the best on chocolate cupcakes
1802488208,140486,2014-02-13,3,"Very easy, lovely texture. Little sugar headache just from licking the beaters though! I&#039;m a fan of a cream cheese frosting, but will come back to this in a pinch when the stores are closed for an ice storm- like today!"
1802545181,140486,2014-03-02,3,"Good foundation. Basic and useful BUT I changed/added a lot to this: 2 tablespoons of butter for each cup of powdered sugar. I made a lot of icing today, probably used 10 cups of powdered sugar, 2 and 1/2 sticks of butter, 6 dollops of sour cream and 8 oz of cream cheese. It is DELICIOUS. added vanilla to my liking."
8102398,140486,2014-03-20,5,I made this within 2 minutes!!! It was a lifesaver as I did not have any icings in the house. I just added 1 extra tablespoon of milk and it iced a 2 layer cake. Next time I will add root beer flavoring to make a vanilla root beer cake.You can use any flavoring you like.
1802616765,140486,2014-03-25,5,"Kid approved! Easy recipe, and my kids loved it. I used whipping cream instead of milk and that seemed to make all the difference. Added a little more cream then called for to make a thinner consistency. Overall great recipe!!"
1802727211,140486,2014-05-08,0,This was an excellent frosting. I only used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and added 1/2 cup of cream cheese and put in fridge to chill for 2 hours. It was delicious for my 24 chocolate cupcakes!
2000863592,140486,2016-02-07,5,WE LOVED THIS.We had no icing at home so we used this website it WORKED. DONT LISTEN TO THE HATERS THIS IS AWESOME AND EASY TRY IT AT HOME!!!!! WOW LOVE IT!
1802802887,140486,2014-06-12,0,"This formula is perfectly fine. It you can write a review, then you&#039;re smart enough to know that you can heat a simple frosting -like this up- to thin it out. I did 4 increments of 6 seconds on the gas stove and it was the perfect consistency. Completely fine."
1803158926,140486,2014-09-28,5,"This was easy and so good. It was a huge hit in my house to go on my homemade white cake. The flavor was good and it wasn&#039;t too sweet. I will say that I did add another tablespoon of milk because I didn&#039;t want it as thick. Otherwise, great as written"
1803486517,140486,2015-01-29,5,Thank You!!! i loved this it was so simple and just sweet enough i was making this for my sisters birthday recipe!
2000062346,140486,2015-03-14,1,"tasted like nasty powered sugar, if I wanted to eat powdered sugar icing don&#039;t you think I would of searched for it !
thanks a lot Martha !"
2000079263,140486,2015-03-22,0,I made this tonight it was amazing. Needed a smidge more milk other than that it was amazing.
2000168292,140486,2015-04-26,0,This is not a frosting!!! This is an icing. Way too thin. I followed the directions to a t. It would be good on cinn rolls. Will not make again for a cake
2000181918,140486,2015-05-16,5,"Yum yum yum! But I also have a suggestion too. I put my frosting in the fridge for about 2 hours and it turned out better. Also, the first time I tried to make it it worked. But the second time I tried to make it it turned out to be stuffs like applesauce. But the flavor is still the same. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong with it. Can someone please tell me? Thx"
2000260269,140486,2015-06-10,0,"Actually, i was out of vanilla and so i made it without vanilla and it still tasted soo good! I love this recipe it is perfect!!"
2000268458,140486,2015-06-14,5,This is the best frosting recipe I&#039;ve found on line so far!
1657272,140486,2015-06-25,4,"I am going to give this a four based on simplicity of ingredients and ease of coming together. However, this does make a very sweet vanilla frosting, be forewarned! Also, as far as the amounts listed I had to add another two tablespoons of milk to get a nice consistency as well as another half teaspoon of vanilla for a smoother taste."
2000344777,140486,2015-07-17,3,I loved it! It was good. Try adding coconut to it and it&#039;s delish!!!!
2000384998,140486,2015-08-05,0,I ended up making it taste like cornbread. Though it is a very good corn muffin recipe. :)
2000385103,140486,2015-08-05,5,Great!
2000398472,140486,2015-08-12,5,So easy and so delicious!
2000420157,140486,2015-08-22,5,"Easy, I had everything on hand.  
Super light and easy to spread on my vegan, gluten free chocolate almond cake!"
2000449400,140486,2015-09-02,5,Tastes good and is great with food colouring
2000490679,140486,2015-09-22,5,"Wonderful recipe! Quick, simple and tasty ?"
2000547354,140486,2015-10-11,0,"I despise this recipe. It is so sugary that I had to completed restart my icing. Two cups of sugar in relation to the amount of other ingredients is a baking disgrace. As a baking guru myself, I wanted something quick and easy so that my 10 and 13 year old kids could make when I&#039;m not there, but all that this recipe has done is make my daughter feel sick and my son afraid to bake alone. I don&#039;t like this and would definitely NOT recommend."
2000595836,140486,2015-10-23,5,"This took no time at all. I was making a tiny cake, so I used half the recipe in a normal kitchen bowl. Didn&#039;t even need an electric mixer, just a quick whisking and it was ready."
2000702496,140486,2015-11-22,4,"great, simple recipe. nothing fancy or creative but still delicious. i made mine with almond milk and i used about 1/2 a cup of milk. 2 tbsp is way too little."
2000650039,140486,2015-12-16,5,worked really well and it was really nice and squishy
2000766705,140486,2015-12-23,5,I love this simple recipe. I added 3 packets of  hot cocoa mix then blended til smooth.
2000772049,140486,2015-12-24,5,"I really loved it! Be careful of putting in too much vanilla extract, though. I put in lemon juice for a lemon icing and it was delicious!"
2000791366,140486,2016-01-01,1,It was horibble!
2000831621,140486,2016-01-22,5,"I love this super simple recipe! I had a persistent sweet tooth that would not subside, so I made a half-portion of this to go with 2 croissants that I threw in the toaster oven with butter, cinnamon, and sugar. It was easy and delicious =)"
2000837212,140486,2016-01-24,5,"This is a great recipe as is. 
Or, substitute/add 1/4 - 1/2 tsp almond extract. vanilla paste, orange extract, mint extract, 2T cocoa . . .  The possibilities are endless. Start with a small amount of flavor and increase to taste. This is what your pinky finger is for, or spoon if someone is watching ;]"
2000909165,140486,2016-03-07,5,"Love love love. I had doubled the amount and substituted almond milk, found that I needed a bit more milk to get the consistency I needed but that is probably just my preference or due to the changes I made. Was a very delicious addition to my carrot cake for those of us who don&#039;t go for the typical cream cheese frosting."
2000924954,140486,2016-03-17,4,"Sub par, I did not enjoy this recipe."
2000947610,140486,2016-04-11,3,"This icing was just OK. I won&#039;t make it again. The taste was off, and I had to add more using sugar because it was too watery."
2000983916,140486,2016-04-23,1,"this frosting was revolting in my opinion. It tasted like powdered sugar and nothing else. And worst of all when I made it it wasn&#039;t fluff, it was a big hard rock, with the consistency of glue. I&#039;m sorry I had my hopes up but I was disappointed."
2459090,140486,2016-06-24,5,"I had some cake mix cookies that needed some extra sweetness. I googled &quot;easy icing&quot; and came up with this recipe. I made 1/2 the recipe using 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp soft butter, 1 Tbsp milk, a few drops vanilla and 1 Tbsp cacao powder. I blended it up with a whisk and it came out smooth and light and gave my cookies just enough sweetness!"
2000936170,140486,2016-06-27,5,Yummy and easy for my daughter to make she is a first time cook.
2001156417,140486,2016-09-05,0,Tasty! I did use almond instead of vanilla for something different:)
2001212763,140486,2016-10-19,5,I made this recipe just as it is and it is great! Super easy to make which was super important since I have never made frosting before and tastes awesome. I know my daughter who is 9 could easily make this on her own is she wanted to make it for something. I did make a second batch with maple extract and it was just as good. I love how you can make easy changes and it stays great. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
2001287420,140486,2016-12-08,5,It was great you guys aren't making it right if your Downing it.....its a great frosting recipe....no baking.....smh Ive put it on cookies cake cupcakes and other pastries
2001289659,140486,2016-12-09,5,We made cupcakes spontaneously today because one of the littles asked if we could. We didn't find any frosting in the pantry to go with it. I was excited to find this easy recipe for frosting. I dont care for naked cupcakes. Unfortunately I only had enough ingredients to make half a batch. The only thing that I think I didn't like was it was Almost to buttery. Almost.
2001294397,140486,2016-12-12,0,it takes a really long time to mix
2001312658,140486,2016-12-22,5,I don't have money to.buy presents for my family so I am making the a bunch of sugar cookies and wanted frosting and I have 5 people and I am making 2 batches of 12 cookies I hope they like it btw it's for.Christmas
2001331503,140486,2017-01-01,5,It was literally the best ever! Thanks for the recipe! It was very simple and delightful! I hope everyone else enjoyed it as much as I did!
2001365304,140486,2017-01-24,1,Okay so I just finished making this recipe and I wasn't very impressed. It was too thick and too sweet and I had to add about 3 tsp of vanilla and probaly 5 tbsp of milk and even then was it too sweet. I like frostings that won't melt into the cake and taste like something else besides sugar.
2000633014,140486,2017-02-06,2,"It turned out runny and taste like wet powdered sugar. There is no vanilla taste to it. I followed the recipe to the letter. I had to put the cake in the refrigerator immediately to keep it from running off the plate. I think it would have been better with the cream cheese, to give it some stiffness and taste."
2001391968,140486,2017-02-14,0,Excellent recipe. Substituted almond extract in place of vanilla. You will not be disappointed.
2001428638,140486,2017-03-11,3,It was good but had to add three tbs of milk because it was to thick but still good!!!
2001450905,140486,2017-03-22,0,Look so good
2001454789,140486,2017-03-25,0,TERRIBLE !!! It does not work at all ! The worst recipe I have ever tried !
2001495133,140486,2017-04-17,0,This was terrible. It was way to sweet but I managed to save it by adding cream cheese to it and then it was delicious. It also works if you add peanut butter. By itself this recipe is nasty but it is a good base for other flavored frosting.
2001530959,140486,2017-05-10,5,This recipe is great! If you're sad and lonely like me and are making half of this to eat by yourself I would suggest adding just a little bit more butter
2001534285,140486,2017-05-13,0,"Little too sweet, and thick. Added more milk and added extra butter, shaved a bit off the powdered sugar. With a little doctoring up this is a good east recipe."
2001550426,140486,2017-05-23,4,"This icing was extremely sweet even for a sweet tooth, however you can make it just right by changing the amount of icing sugar added to the recipe. I traded half a cup of the sugar for another full teaspoon of vanilla extract. This turns the icing into a smooth and rich coating perfect for cupcakes."
2001578788,140486,2017-06-11,3,"i love how simple this recipe was. Thanks! it can be easily tweak to ones taste but it is the foundation of a great recipe. i added a little extra milk and it made it runny so I had some extra soften white chocolate from making my kids candy treats, so I added the left over soften white chocolate and it was absolutely the best! This is going to be a recipe that I pass down. Thanks and don't mind the negativity. Some people are just ignorant. they can't help it poor little Tim Tims lol."
2001600076,140486,2017-06-25,0,We made 50% more then added another 1/2 icing to get our preferred thickness. 2 drops of red Food colouring for 1/5 of the icing made this nice pink! Super sweet!
2001615015,140486,2017-07-06,0,I love how simple this is and taste great. I added an 8 oz cube of cream cheese to it and it's delicious. Thanks for sharing.
2001728928,140486,2017-09-24,5,"Finally a recipe that didnt require a trip to the store. This is lovely on its own, or as a blank canvas. I added lemon zest, and I look forward to using this as my starting point from now on. Thanks for sharing this, its perfect and it doesn't make a wasteful bucket full either :)"
2001832951,140486,2017-12-01,0,"I wanted something a little less sweet so I added half of a container approx 4oz of whipped cream cheese I had in the fridge, beat it into the mixture until smooth. I filled the cake down the center after it was completely cooled, layered the mixture on using more than half. Replaced the halves back together, took the remaining frosting and added half a cup of cool whip, blended together and spread it atop of my devil food chocolate cake. Talk about YUMMY! ??not to sweet, not to bland, just right."
2001976321,140486,2018-02-05,0,Doesn't seem like a lot of liquid for 2 cups of powdered sugar
2002005144,140486,2018-02-22,5,
2002061222,140486,2018-03-18,5,so good! I thought this might not work but this is amazing! I don't like frosting but this one tastes so good!
2002257224,140486,2018-08-25,0,What if you don't have powdered sugar or a food processor??? What else can I use??
2002315058,140486,2018-10-28,1,"Nothing but complete garbage, followed the recipe to a T and all I got was a donut glaze, too runny to even do anything with and not even fit to put on cupcakes."
227652,140486,2018-12-05,5,This was incredibly simple and easy to put together. Thank you so much!
133174,200043,2006-12-25,5,This is such a simple way to compliment a prime rib dinner.  I used an apricot fruit spread in place of the preserves.  Followed the rest of the instructions and the dish was ready in 15 minutes.  Thanks Kitten!
84038,200043,2006-12-25,5,Wow! Wow! Wow!  I almost ate all the glaze before I could use it for the asparagus.  I never knew apricot and asparagus married so well.  I used this as a side-dish on Christmas and will use it quite often.  Thank you!
305531,200043,2007-02-05,5,"Yum! I used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder, otherwise made the recipe as directed. Very nice side dish. Thanks Kitten for another winner."
176615,200043,2007-04-09,5,"Yum! Served this for Easter dinner and really enjoyed the combination of flavors. Light and fresh tasting, the glaze highlights the asparagus but doesn't overpower it. Used reduced-sodium soy sauce. Quick and easy enough for a weeknight dinner. Nearly fat free, an added bonus. I'll make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
444622,200043,2007-04-22,5,Instead of fresh asparagus I did used canned that I rinsed and patted dry. Didnt take quite 10 minutes to bake and the asparagus smelled awesome.  I love soy sauce and apricot preserves and combined they are even better. Will be making this again with fresh asparagus too. Served with L. and T. Mom's recipe #199049.
125640,200043,2008-03-25,5,I used this as a side-dish on Easter. Very quick and easy to make. Simple and fresh tasting. Perfect texture. Very nice compliment to ham. Healthy too. Thanks for sharing.
158086,200043,2008-05-19,5,Great vegetable recipe....I used sugar free jam and they turned out perfect...
48920,200043,2008-08-05,5,Fantastic take on roasted asparagus.  Very simple prep.  My 82 year old father wanted the recipe and I think he can certainly prepare on his own - a bonus!  Thank you so much Kitten!
253974,200043,2008-11-15,5,I found asparagus very reasonable the other day and tried this recipe.  I used the sugar free jam as did one of the other reviews. This brings asparagus to a new level!  It's absolutely delicious! My hubby even tried it and he hates asparagus!  Thanks Kitten for another fabulous recipe! This is a keeper!
795588,200043,2008-12-06,5,"I made this recipe exactly as written with no deviations. Wow! If you are looking for a new way to prepare your asparagus, I encourage you to try this recipe. I never expected the asparagus to taste so wonderful. I am not sure if it is the soy or the apricot preserves, but something or combination thereof, really brought out the natural flavor of the asparagus. I do not give many recipes 5 stars, but I have no hesitation is giving this recipe the full Monty."
226863,200043,2009-02-08,5,This was really good.  I love asparagus and this was a very unique way to make it.  I think this would be great with an Asian flavored chicken dish...can't wait to try it again.  Made this for Zaar Stars Tag.
1328942,200043,2010-03-02,5,"Rather than roasting this, I stir fried it with a little oil. It came out pretty good!"
89549,200043,2010-08-03,5,Delicious and easy.  I left out the salt.
243474,200043,2012-02-01,5,"Other than using less-sodium soy sauce, made exactly as written.  Just the right amount of sweet and savory."
44420,30131,2007-08-03,5,Why haven't I reviewed this before?  I've used it on both chicken and steaks and it is a terrific marinade.  Thanks for posting.
440324,30131,2012-10-29,5,I used it on shrimp and even though it turned them a bit brown they tasted great. Can't wait to try it on some beef. Thank you.
289066,197091,2007-08-05,4,"I made this using butter instead of shortening, and did not do the optional crumb topping.  It was a really nice basic baked corn.  I want to try this again but with some add ins to spice things up.  Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!"
94243,197091,2007-11-27,5,"Yum!  This turned out really good.  I used a flavored cracker (I think they were rosemary and olive oil) to put on the top and they gave it a really good flavor.  I'll be using this recipe again!  Thanks, Marg!

Amy"
430823,197091,2007-12-29,5,"This turned out very good.  I have made this several times, once for our Thanksgiving dinner. This is a different way to serve corn."
232669,435687,2010-08-24,5,"Wonderful! I have always enjoyed breakfast at any other meal & this one came in just right last night at about 9:00pm. There were a few of us who had gone to a special meeting for people in homes & all the different departments etc. The meeting was good but left us drained and hungry and I had just cut this out yesterday - so we made it and enjoyed it immensely! We used the regular English muffins with grated sharp cheddar on it, then we divided the spinach among the 4 ramekins with the broken pieces of bacon & then like a hole-in-one (we made the indentation) & broke the egg - & voilá - the dish was oven-read! When we ate it - the only problem I found was not enough bread to sop up the wonderful egg yolks with. Yes, it is a luscious meal - I know that is not a word that is used with savory dishes but it was! Thanks for posting Scoutie. :)"
13483,123689,2005-09-14,5,This is an excellent salad dressing.  Quick to prepare and it enhansed my greens tremendously.  Glad you posted this Oolala
440324,123689,2012-02-11,5,"I made this dressing several days ago and everyone agreed that this should become our ""house"" dressing, since it was of restaurant quality and simple to prepare. I'm going to make another batch right now. Thank you for letting me borrow this recipe and make it a part of my family's traditions."
197023,97873,2006-03-15,5,"The apricots were looking pretty ordinary when I was hunting down the ingredients for this tart, so I used nectarines which were very sweet and juicy.  The instructions were really easy to follow: always such a plus!  I used only about half the specified amount of sugar (it would otherwise have simply been too sweet for us), and I used brown sugar.  This tart was truly delicious and well worth the effort.  I'll certainly make this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, ellie_!"
140524,90648,2004-05-07,0,1. slice the bananas.
227652,90648,2005-08-27,5,"WOW! This was delicious! I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter & I highly reccomend that as it adds to the sweetness  & taste. I used Splenda granular, sugar free maple syrup & Eggbeaters. Tasted wonderful without syrup! Thank you so much. I love bananas & this is a healthy way to enjoy them. "
465911,90648,2007-05-24,5,I love these!! I used pure canadian maple syrup and added cinnamon. I will be making these again!
255260,142078,2005-11-02,5,"This was great, sweet n sour type of sloppy joe, I would make this instead of sloppy joes anyday, its to dye for.  Reminds me of hotdog stuffers my grandmother used to make, she would freeze them in the bun w/tin foil & u could later put in the over"
447487,327593,2011-03-24,4,"Very nice crepe recipe! I must have messed up my calculations when I multiplied the recipe as I had to add more flour, I also added ground flax seed as suggested. Nice, easy recipe. We enjoyed these crepes for Shrove Tuesday 2011 with fillings Recipe# 373390, Recipe #129644 and strawberries & whipped cream for desert. A nice, fairly light and simple dinner. Thanks for another excellent recipe posting, Sunny. Made and enjoyed for PAC Spring 2011."
43083,102759,2004-11-20,4,"Lorac, this was a mighty tasty corn side dish! I am a cream cheese fanatic and am ashamed I didnt think of this myself. I topped it with fresh chives! Thanks again! Love your recipes!"
179133,102759,2007-10-23,5,"Delicious! I couldn't find whipped cream cheese w/ chives (only plain) so used regular (light) w/ chives & onion. Used lots of fresh black pepper which gave it a bit of ""bite"". Lovely! Thanks!"
351811,102759,2008-07-23,4,"My boys ate this up! They love corn and this dish. It is so easy to prepare. I used Garlic & Herb Cream Swirls Cheese and added the chives. Lots of Pepper and topped with dried chives. Great taste. Trying to figure out how to make it look pretty thou! :) At first glance....Hmmm, I had to make the boys try it, once they did... it was gone! (Made for Cook-a-Thon for Lorac)"
162826,102759,2008-09-14,5,"Outstanding! I had some left-overs from Recipe#320397, so just added them to your sauce and what a great side dish to Ham Loaf! Will definitely made again."
95743,118312,2005-04-24,5,"Elegantly simple, delicious and an attractive presentation.  Just wish tomatoes were in season. Even so, this was company-worthy."
308434,329170,2008-10-13,5,"This is  very good!  I didn't have roughy...so I used Blue Cod, and everyone loved it. Thank you for sharing."
96177,329170,2009-02-14,5,"So quick and easy, we love this kind of recipe. All these ingredients are on hand, and we love that even more. Couldn't find roughy, so used Costo Cod and thought it was great. Nice flavor and crispy texture. Made for holiday tag."
60124,329170,2009-04-16,4,"nice and easy, low cal. We found it very bland and a tad dry. Was good with a bit of lemon juice, and the cold fish was very good the next day on a sandwhich."
39835,329170,2010-03-19,5,Delicious fish  and simple to make too! We had this with coleslaw -- great Friday night supper! Thanks for sharing!
1376928,419672,2010-09-19,5,I only had yellow squash so I cut those up into thin slices and lined a baking dish with the pieces.  Then I poured the mixture over each piece and poured a small amount of honey over everything.  I love the way that this came out! I am not normally a squash person but I really wanted to try a new vegetable.  Thanks for posting!
116195,39467,2004-07-25,4,"Wonderful. We grow Roma tomatos only. I tried this with fresh basil from our garden... my wife tells me that it caused a near riot at her work....

Works for me. I use the Roma tomatos from our garden, and fresh basil from my patio.

Don't bother cutting into wedges... I just fold it in half like a gyro...
"
56353,39467,2005-11-13,5,"This reminds me slightly of the Italian stone oven pizzas. I  use a basting brush to evenly coat the pita rather than drizzle oil randomly. I also seperated the ringlets of the onion and spread them around the pita.I also do the tomatoes very thin.THe kids love this, hubby too. I make this often using pepperoni instead of bacon to speed up the prep time. "
58439,291207,2008-03-11,4,"Refreshing as can be!
LOVE combo banana and strawberry!
Not too tart, not to sweet, TRUE!
LOVE it for brekkie or mid afternoon snack too!"
424680,291207,2008-04-13,5,"Well, I tried this one both ways, one with OJ & one with milk! Great, no matter which one you choose, although I slightly favored the OJ version! Thanks for posting this one! [Made & reviewed for one of my adopted chefs in this Spring's PAC]"
20480,291207,2009-09-06,5,"This was so good; I used frozen mixed berries and milk instead of orange juice; that is why the colour is darker. I really don't care for smoothies that are too sweet; this one is perfect.
Thanks  for sharing.

168896,233830,2007-07-11,5,excellent food.  used all organic ingredients.  my 3 yr old daughter loved them and her and i made a meal out of them with some risotto as the side dish.  very very easy to put together and the taste was not overly sweet at all.  all the flavors balanced well together and we both enjoyed making it and will definitly make this again.  thanks so much for sharing!!!!
422893,233830,2007-08-06,5,"A very nice simple side dish, not overly sweet but a great way to jazz up the humble carrot. Still couldn't get my DD to eat it but that doesn't surprise me these days! Thanks for posting!"
305531,233830,2007-10-17,5,"Delish! I used baby carrots and left them whole, but followed the rest of the recipe as directed. We really enjoyed that subtle taste of nutmeg too. Thanks for such a simple and wonderful side dish Maryland Jim."
430471,233830,2007-10-29,5,"These were really good. Not overly sweet.  Great side dish for baked chicken. I steamed my carrots in the microwave, then added all of the other ingredients and nuked for about 2 more minutes. Yummy. And as an added plus...DD (3) liked these to."
560491,233830,2007-10-29,3,"These were great!  I usually only have cooked carrots when I make roast because plain they aren't good, but with this sauce I will be making more carrots.  Next time I will steam then rather than boil so they are more done, we like then completely soft."
705251,233830,2009-09-20,5,"Very nice side dish Jim.  I chunked up whole carrots in place of the ""baby carrots"" but that was the only change.  The slight taste of nutmeg and orange is wonderful with the carrots.  A nice change of pace from the other way I make a side dish of carrots.  Made for your win in the Football Pool Week 1 of 2009!  Congrats!"
56003,233830,2010-06-13,5,"I have been learning to eat carrots more this last year, as they have never been one of my favorite veggies, but this can, definitely, be entered into my â€œBut I'm Eating More Carrots, Julieâ€� cookbook.  Thnx for sharing your recipe, Jim.  Made for a fellow Vagabond during ZWT 6."
690623,233830,2010-06-14,5,"Five stars for such an easy and tasty carrot dish!  It was a perfect accompanyment for recipe #321104 and recipe #340342  I expect that I will be making carrots this way many, many more times.  I was not careful with my measurements and made enough for 2.  I used all of the apricot preserve but would scale it back next time to the more appropriate 1/8 cup.
Made on behalf of the Looney Spoon Phoodies ~ ZWT6"
309630,233830,2013-02-06,4,Really simple and tasty way to make carrots.  This will be my new go to recipe for carrots when I want to change up my menu choices.  Made for your 2013 Superbowl win.
76535,95355,2004-07-19,3,I would suggest using 2/3 - 3/4 cups sugar.
64583,70920,2004-09-07,5,"I've never seen a recipe for banana crumble before, (I always make apple crisp), so I was anxious to try this.  I was not disappointed at all. It's very delicious and we all enjoyed it.  The bananas are not very attractive looking after baking because they get pretty dark, but the taste is still great.  I do recommend eating it within an hour or two of baking because the bananas do get a little mushier on sitting.  But regardless of that, we loved it and it made a very nice dessert.   Also, no bake temperature was specified so I used 375 degrees for 15 minutes in an 8 X 8 pan (because I don't have any ramekins).  Thanks!"
214855,70920,2005-10-02,5,Made this for an impromptu dinner with friends last night. All I had were some bananas - this was totally finished. I would add more bananas next time probably 6 for the amount of crumble. It was delicious - thank you for posting.
189616,70920,2005-10-08,5,"Never heard of banana crumble before, glad I spotted this recipe. My ramekins must have been a smaller size than recipe called for, because I only used 3 bananas and had topping left over. The aroma was wonderful! I used rolled oats instead of granola
Thank You dojemi-"
241948,70920,2006-02-27,4,This recipe was great...but not perfect. We thought it could use a bit more sugar. Other than that it was perfect thanks!
230258,70920,2006-03-08,5,"Great! It is a twist on banana oatmeal and I like it! I only made one servings worth for just me this morning and it barley took anytime to put together and bake.
Thanks for the recipe!"
218936,70920,2007-10-04,4,I didn't have ramekins so I used an 8x8 pan and I doubled the topping like I do with apple crisp. It was fantastic! My kids gobbled it up! Thanks for something different to make with bananas!
160974,70920,2007-10-23,5,"This was soooo good and so quick to make. I cut about 3-4 bananas (thickly) and put in a shallow casserole dish. I used Heartland brand granola. The topping was perfect. I topped with a dollop of Cool Whip and drizzle of maple syrup and it was WONDERFUL. Even my daughter liked it and she doesn't like bananas. Great cold the next day.

Update: I used 2 tbs. butter cut up very fine (mixer) and it baked up fine (trying to save a few calories)! I topped with some Jello vanilla pudding and it was to die for!

206747,70920,2007-10-29,4,"Always have bananas which become more ripe than DH will eat them - but are not ripe enough for me to enjoy.  We have been buying from Big Box store at a really LOW price, eating what we wanted - then tossing the really rotten ones away.  This was a delightful dinner dessert, where I put about 1 TBSP dark rum (brought from ""The Islands"" by DD and DSIL), then added crumble on top, prior to baking.  prepared 1 banana each, and added vanilla ice cream at serving time -- was a VERY nice, fruity dessert !  Thanks, dojemi, for posting."
28553,70920,2008-06-15,5,"This was just perfect for an evening when I needed something quick, and only had a bunch of bananas.  I used the rolled oats, increased the brown sugar to 1/3 & used 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  Thank you for a great recipe!"
537188,70920,2008-07-02,5,Delicious!
244913,70920,2008-07-16,5,Any ideas on how to incorporate some peanut butter with this? Still a great tasting crumble!!
89549,70920,2008-07-20,5,"This is pleasant change from the regular apple crumble.  I like it very much.  Would add a few chopped nuts the next time.  For Chef #244913's question, you could put dollops of peanut butter over the bananas in the dish. Then sprinkle the crumble on.  The oven's heat will melt and distribute the peanut butter.  Yum!"
486648,70920,2008-09-02,4,"Yum. This was so easy to throw together, and tasted really good! I put the 4 bananas in a small casserole instead of separate ramekins and that worked well. I also sprinkled about 1/2 cup of shredded coconut over the bananas before the crumb topping. It's a great way to get my picky 3 yo. son to eat oats! (I don't have to worry about bananas, he'd eat them all day long!). I bet chopped walnuts would be great, maybe even dried blueberries...Thanks for the recipe, I would have never thought to make a crumble with bananas!"
425105,70920,2008-11-07,3,"I just love apple crisp, and I like bananas, so I was expecting to like this more. It was ok, but I'm not sure that the flavors worked so well for me."
310322,70920,2009-09-12,5,I made this for my husband and he was pleasantly surprised - I did not add salt (used salted butter) and I increased the flour to 1 included a 1/4 tsp cloves and I cooked it in a casserole dish. The bananas tend to cook down and liquify so I drained the liquid after it cooled.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it.
800045,70920,2009-11-30,5,"There aren't enough stars to rate this recipe. I served it warm with ice cream and the family loved it. It was quick and easy to make definatly a keeper, and will be making it again soon. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
355656,70920,2010-03-23,5,"I made one serving, but then only had half with a 100 calorie scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. I sprinkled cinnamon on it, and it was sooooo tasty!  And the best thing is that I have another low-cal dessert for tomorrow night.  Yay!"
1050639,70920,2010-06-20,5,"So perfect! I made this as a yummy summer dessert and it was exactly that! I didn't have ramekins so I used an 8 x 8 corningware dish. For the granola- I used ""Just Bunches"" cereal. It's only the bunches from ""Honey Bunches of Oats."" Talk about delicious!!! I topped it with vanilla ice cream and it was great. Highly recommended!!"
57222,70920,2013-01-23,4,"Easy and good! I made two servings: we had this as-is (no ice cream in the house, wah!), so I drizzled a little golden syrup on the banana slices before adding the crumb topping, so that it wouldn't turn out dry. Much enjoyed! Thank you for sharing!"
128473,70920,2013-06-01,5,"This is the perfect last minute recipe.  It&#039;s good enough to serve to family and friends.  We enjoyed this simple treat so much.  It was wonderful hot and cold.  I didn&#039;t get to add any ice cream to it, after I tasted it, it was so good, that I couldn&#039;t stop eating it and it was gone before I knew it.  Next time I will add ice cream or whipped cream for a truly spectacular treat.  I should add that I used very ripe bananas, they worked perfectly in this dish.  Love this new way to use over ripe bananas. Thank you for sharing a recipe that we will enjoy often."
1115116,70920,2013-08-14,5,"Am I the only one who added chocolate?  I used a 9 x 13 casserole dish, doubled the topping and added chopped baking squares of chocolate on top to melt through as it bakes.  Fabulous!!!"
137854,70920,2014-04-26,5,"As lovely a crumble as any!  We added strawberries, and also (shhhh!) sprinkled some white and milk chocolate pieces on top before baking.  Served with cream and ice cream -- delicious!"
463763,70920,2016-05-01,4,This was pretty good. Next time I'd add the ice cream to it.
2001514301,70920,2017-04-30,5,"This is the perfect recipe! I registered on Food.com just to thank you for this recipe, and to tell you that I love it! It's a great way to use overripe bananas and as others have said, it's something you can prepare very quickly after dinner without any planning."
107135,455187,2012-03-16,5,i put the potatoes in it was a nice casserole  i liked the caramelized onion in the noodles i cooked everything stove top it was OK
136997,269156,2009-02-09,4,Very nice marinade. I used it for Recipe #349333 :)
5060,91282,2009-06-08,4,"This was good asparagus but DH didn't care for the cilantro, next time I will use the parsley.  I have to agree unless you are a cilantro lover, you should use the parsley.  i felt it overpowered the aspargus, but we loved the sesame and the walnuts were a lovely finish.  I'm sure we would love the dressing with parsley, it was nice and creamy!  Thaks Tebo!"
89549,91282,2010-07-30,3,"I used parsley and felt it overpowered the dish.  It also seemed to ""need"" a little something.  Garlic maybe.  It was nice to try something different, but I probably will try something else next time."
590105,296094,2008-04-29,5,This went together very quickly and tasted great!  Thanks!  Reviewed for an Asian Forum Tag with a long name that I forget.  lol
323186,324048,2008-11-06,5,"Very easily made, I roasted the eggplants, in their skin,  in the oven, until they were soft and tender.    I then peeled them, and let the pulp cool, and refrigerated it overnight.

Next day I used my hand blender to mash the flesh, and added the mayo and garlic powder.   Its that easy....:)

It has strong garlic flavour, but it's very pleasant, we had some on biscuits and I think it would be good on toast triangles too!

Thanks, Studentchef!"
1410944,324048,2009-11-04,5,I remember my mom making this too! It's delicious!
993143,324048,2011-05-16,0,This is the best baba ganoush recipe I have found.  Even better if a bit of the charred skin is left on.  Thanks for posting!
374891,451277,2017-02-28,4,"I made this recipe as directed, only I had a 3lb pork loin, so I pretty much trippled the recipe, and lengthened the cooking time accordingly. It turned out great. Very tasty and moist. Thanks!"
88342,42198,2003-08-04,0,"You shouldn't be recommending eating raw eggs without a serious warning.  The volumn of the ""BOX"" of sugar wuld be helpfull too."
37229,42198,2004-07-07,5,"Very yummy! I didn't realize my 8x8 pan was dirty so I had to use a slightly smaller dish and less strawberries and cream as a result, but it turned out wonderful! I took it to my inlaws for 4th of July and there was almost nothing left! I only had 2 cups of powdered sugar and it was almost too sweet. I'd definetly not use a whole 16 oz box. I will definetly make this again! Sooooo Good! Thanks for the recipie!"
35526,42198,2004-08-02,4,"I used a half a box of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Not sure what happened but alot of the vanilla wafer crumbs never got wet enough to be a part of the dessert.  Loved the taste though as did  my guests.  I will be making this again but will experiment with the sugar, egg and butter mixture to make it a little runnier maybe."
195984,42198,2005-02-15,5,I have looked for years for this recipe. My aunt made it when I was a child and I loved it. I thought it was called French Strawberry Pudding. I tried to make it from the memory of watching her. It was the eggs I left out. Thanks so much.
545717,42198,2008-05-17,5,"Delicious! The only change I made was that I used egg substitute in place of the eggs, it worked fine. Thank you for sharing this refreshing dessert."
166642,218323,2007-05-09,5,This made a very nice snack! We love apples and they went nicely with the cheese and the wheat tortillas. I will make again!
463202,218323,2007-05-10,4,"I made this for lunch yesterday, and it was really good.  Picky picky DD liked it, too.  The way I usually assemble my quesadillas is to butter one side of the tortilla very thinly (I find this helps me use less butter), place butter side down in the pan, sprinkle cheese over the whole tortilla, place the filling on half (apples for this recipe), and then fold when the cheese has melted (about 30 seconds to 1 minute).  I was always getting filling falling out when I tried to assemble them and then move them to the pan.  I will definitely be making this again."
444622,218323,2007-06-23,4,We used regular flour tortillas instead of whole wheat and granny smith apples. Enjoyed these for a quick weekend snack with sharp cheddar cheese sprinkled on the apples. Very tasty and versatile recipe!
64667,218323,2007-09-12,5,"Had these for breakfast and heard rave reviews from the kids and Gramma.   The only thing I *thought* was that they were a bit sort-of blah...I guess I wanted something to jazz them up a bit, I don't know, ginger?  brown sugar?  cinnamon?   I LOVE the melted cheddar & apple, but wanted it to kick me a bit (wake me up!).    DD is becoming quite the little quesadilla maker, and --as suggested by an earlier review-er-- puts the butter in the pan, THEN the tortilla followed by all the ingredients.  Less mess, and quick, too!    We figured ONE tortilla per person, folded & sliced into three little sammichs.  Served with watermelon and a glass of milk--yummy!"
240552,218323,2007-11-12,5,"Yum!  I used granny smith as we love the tartness of grannys and then the sharpness of the cheese really made this a great lunchtime treat!  Thanks, SusieQusie!"
527607,218323,2007-11-28,5,these were a great fast and delicious breakfast.  Since i only had granny smith i added a smidgeon of nutella spread to it as well
58104,218323,2008-03-31,5,"John and I enjoyed these for breakfast! Using 1 apple and 4 flour tortillas, the cheese I didn`t measure and the butter I used a spray. I made it on a whole tortilla then topped with a whole one instead of folding in 1/2.  I sprinkled with a dusting of cinnamon! Thanks!"
690623,218323,2009-04-27,4,"This was a very yummy snack!  I used extra old cheddar and Granny Smiths.  I kept thinking I'd love something to dip it in but wasn't sure what...caramel, sour cream, creme fraiche?  Anyway, I didn't and they were very good.   I can see making these very often.  Thanks for a quick, tasty, good for you snack :)"
693345,218323,2009-04-28,5,"Mmmm... I just made this for lunch. I have never had the combination of apples and cheese, before trying this. I sprayed the griddle with cooking spray and used a flour tortilla and American cheese, because I didn't have the right ingredients - but I'm not gonna fault the chef for my not going to the grocery store...hehe. I am definitely going to make this again (with the RIGHT stuff). :) Thanks!"
424680,218323,2010-07-17,5,"Really enjoyed the combo of Fuji apples & the cheddar cheese ~ Quite a bit like the apple pie & cheese combo that my mom used to make! And, although I'm not usuallya big on whole wheat tortillas, they definitely worked in this recipe! Will certainly be making these again & again! Thanks for posting the recipe!

2001071110,490725,2016-07-02,5,These little garlicky puffs of love are absolutely to die for! Perfect for any occasion! They're so buttery and full of flavour; they're so addicting you want to eat a whole plate in one sitting! 5+ stars!
690268,490725,2016-07-17,5,"Only ever eaten these, never made them. But wow. I'll dream about them tonight and wake up smelling of garlic tomorrow."
2001092613,490725,2016-07-17,5,We always have a batch of these in the freezer. They make our mid-week spaghetii dinners extra special.

186855,413693,2010-03-06,5,"It's been a very long time since I've had Baklava. The only thing I really remember is that it was very, very sweet and sticky. That being said, I can't say how close this is to the 'original'. I can however tell you that these tarts are very good.  For me, these are just like butter tarts (who doesn't like butter tarts?) made with walnuts and spices. Of course the cream cheese in the pastry is a wonderful bonus!!!! After pressing the pastry into the tins, I first added the walnuts, then spooned in the sugar/egg mixture. These baked up for me in 20 minutes. The pastry is very tender when warm, so I had to wait a little longer before taking them out of the tins. Worked perfectly for me, as I had no accidents. I must say, they were even tastier (if that's possible) the second and third day. Sooo good. Made for RSC #15. Thanks for sharing your recipe, and good luck in the contest."
424680,419992,2011-10-19,5,"Simple & easy-to-make recipe, & an absolutely delicious cobbler, to boot! I always have frozen peaches (use 'em in smoothies, among other things) so this was a snap!

157425,419992,2012-05-29,5,Peach cobbler is my favorite dessert and this one was very yummy! I did add a shake or two of nutmeg along with the cinnamon. Ate my cobbler while still warm and will be keeping frozen peaches on hand from now on. Made and reviewed for Pick A Chef Orphanaage - May 2012.
169430,419992,2014-04-20,5,"First time I&#039;ve used frozen peaches for a cobbler but it won&#039;t be the last. DH and I are real cobbler/crisp fans and this one is tops. I used Splenda for the added sugar. Made a half recipe in an 8x8 pan and intended it for tonight&#039;s Easter dessert. There&#039;s still enough for dessert but we made a healthy dent in it for lunch, lol. Made of PAC, Spring 2014."

I wish there was more arugula in this.  The peas are spot on perfect.  I couldn't make the dressing because I didn't have the strawberries.  Perhaps add them to the ingredient list.  I used a pear vinegar that I had in the cupboard.  A really nice salad, and a nice change of pace.  I will make this up at camp in the summer!

I did take the suggestion & uped the amount of lemon juice, but can't say for sure how well it worked, 'cause the pie didn't last very long around here!

One liked it, and two thought it was strange. I, however, have been waiting to get home to have another slice all afternoon! I highly recommend it for raw food eaters!"

199848,155956,2006-09-24,5,Deliciously cinnamon-y!  I put this together last night and popped it in the oven this morning.  I topped it with syrup and diced locally grown peaches.  Fantastic....and easy!  Thanx for posting this; it's a keeper!
182624,155956,2006-11-26,0,"I can't rate this recipe because I left out the butter!  We didn't care for it very much, and I'm quite sure this was why.  I didn't intend to ruin it, but I melted my butter in the microwave and simply forgot to whisk it with the rest of the ingredients.  My husband found it later in the day and got a big kick out of it.  I'm definitely going to make it again using ALL the ingredients...I'll let you know how it turns out!"
21462,155956,2008-09-14,5,"Wow!  That was really good baked french toast.    We didn't have any leftovers.   I used a crusty cinnamon bread roll from our bakery, so I didn't add the cinnamon that the recipe called for.   It was excellent."
532510,155956,2009-02-09,5,This was so good!  I'd like to flip them next time for the last five minutes.  Will definitely have it again...didn't need fruit for us but that would be good for you:)

369715,155956,2011-01-29,5,Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I used light syrup. Next time I would cut up the bread and flip it during cooking because it was a bit mushy but oh so very good.
171084,155956,2011-09-11,5,"After searching for recipes that did not require an overnight soak in the fridge, I made this recipe.  I am sooo glad I did.  I used 7 pieces of potato bread and this was wonderful!!  Super easy recipe!  I seriously doubt I will ever make french toast the old way (in a skillet) again.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!"
1242099,155956,2013-01-28,4,"Really good recipe... my husband and I liked another recipe better, but the kids LOVED it.  It wouldn't be my ""go to"" recipe, but I would definitely try it again.  Next time I would grease the pan more generously... since the bread stuck to the sides and in some parts to the bottom.  My favorite thing was the maple syrup mixed together... I just put a tiny bit of syrup on.<br/><br/>Thanks!"
107583,89048,2008-10-19,5,"Great breakfast.  Not too filling.  I used parmesan but will try it with Fontina next time I can afford it! :)

187927,182809,2008-09-17,4,"Very nice change from plain ol' mayo, and a nice use of fresh basil. I actually used this tonight not on a sandwich, but spread on some tilapia that I then coated with breadcrumbs and baked. It added a lovely, fresh flavor to the fish. My only question about the recipe is the amount of lemon juice called for -- how DOES one calculate 1/4 of a tablespoon? I suspect the actual amount is supposed to be  1 1/4 TEASPOON, but I went ahead and used one full tablespoon. The flavor was wonderful nevertheless. I think this would be an ideal spread for a tomato/mozzarella sandwich... mmmmm.... guess I have to go buy some good cheese now!"
330545,182809,2009-02-25,5,I made this as posted and thought it wonderful on my sandwich.  It's good and garlicky and gave the sandwich an extra kick.  TFS.
413880,182809,2010-04-27,4,This is my 2nd year of growing herbs so I am still looking for special ways to use them.  I loved this recipe as it helped me to use my basil and was not any trouble.  I really did not measure so I probably did not use the full cup of mayo and used all of the basil that I had picked so I had more of it.  I did not use any salt.  I put it on a slice of sourdough bread and then put sliced tomatoes and sliced chicken breast 15580.  I then put shredded mozzarella on top and broiled.  It was sooooo yummy!  Thanks so much for getting me started on a great way to use my fresh basil.
1250369,182809,2014-02-12,5,This was really good. I used oregano instead of basil. I couldn&#039;t resist sorry I really love oregano. I loved the zest from the lemon. I spread this on a turkey sandwich. Thanks for the post.

383346,115754,2007-06-25,5,I made it 2 times.  First time I didn't have sesame seeds.  It was still delicious.  And yesterday I bought sesame seeds and could try with it.  It's even better.  I used a barbecue sauce that is sweetened with brown sugar.  Made for ZWT 3

37107,115754,2010-01-18,2,"I'm sorry I had to go a little bit low on the stars but for some reason, my batch burned by 6-1/2 minutes.  My oven was at 350, and I kept checking them.  They started to get dark around the edges and by 6 minutes, I decided to turn them.  Good thing I was watching them because when I opened my oven door at 6-1/2 minutes, this big plume of smoke came out at me.  No way was I going to turn them and put them back in for 8 more minutes.  They all burned on the bottom and edges.  I don't know why - was it because I used fresh garlic instead of the powder?  Is it because I used parchment paper?  I would really like these to work out so I will try them again.  Next time, I'm going to bake them on the middle rack at the highest temp. of 300 - 325 F.  Hope that helps."

1017784,383047,2009-07-28,0,Only an idiot would feed this to a baby!
248913,383047,2010-05-03,0,It is dangerous to give a baby under one years old honey due to infant botulism. Botulinum toxin is the most poisonous natural substance known to man. Botulinum spores are found in honey.  A very small amount can kill an infant.  Therefore doctors strongly recommend that infants under one years old not be given honey.  Even cooked items (or processed items) with honey as an ingredient should not be given to infants because heat does not kill the spores.

The combined flavours of the honey, sugar and cinnamon: pure magic!  Thank you, Peter, for this simple to make heavenly dessert.

564378,155017,2008-07-22,4,"I liked this but made a few substitutions. I didnt have any tarragon or paprika so used oregano from my garden. I also cut out the butter as I'm trying to eat healthier. 
It tasted great and was really easy. Thanks!"

650755,155017,2011-04-29,5,"Thanks, what a quick and easy recipe. I also omitted the tarragon as didn't have any.  I've also made this once using smoked haddock which came out equally delicious."
369715,155017,2012-11-27,4,This was good and easy to make. I didn't have any tarragon and only used one garlic clove. I also used old bay instead of paprika. I hadn't read the directions before making and stirred everything in with the butter. I baked this and then put it in the broiler for five minutes. We all enjoyed this for dinner.
2707161,155017,2013-02-23,0,"I made this exactly as written, except I used 1 lb, of haddock, 2 Tbs. of butter and cooked in an 8 x 8 casserole dish for about 20 minutes. Don't skip the tarragon, it makes this dish soooo delicious. I live in Maine and have cooked haddock at least 100 times. This was by far the best I ever had and so easy to make. I even used haddock that had been frozen (at sea) and thawed. This is a ""must have"" in my recipe file."

2000923758,155017,2016-03-16,5,I used olive oil instead of butter and did not have any Tarragon.  It was the best baked haddock I have ever made!  My husband loved it!  Will use this recipe from now on!
2000995349,155017,2016-05-01,5,"Being married to a commercial fisherman, Haddock is often on our plates. Right from the boat. It is a very tender fish and should be treated as such. I brushed the filets with garlic infused oil mixed with the melted butter along with the lemon juice and a mixture of Italian seasonings instead of the tarragon. I did not include the crushed garlic as I felt that there would be enough garlic flavor from the oil. I started with the original recipe and then made it my own with a few changes. I have been cooking Haddock for more than 50 years and this recipe is so simple. You can't go wrong. Great flavor from the seasonings along with the delicate taste of the Haddock."
2001355162,155017,2017-01-17,5,"This was pretty good! I tweaked it a little after reading the reviews. I also used olive oil, saut&eacute;ed fresh chopped garlic in it along with parsley, paprika, a lil sea salt, cracked pepper and thyme as I did not have tarragon. I sea salted the fish, added more cracked pepper on the fish, basted it with the olive oil mixture and then squeezed fresh lemon all over it and baked it in the oven at a higher heat."
2001415462,155017,2017-03-03,5,Very easy and very tasty.

2001954481,155017,2018-01-27,3,"Question is: says to use minced garlic, i used the kind that is stored in the refrigerator but i learned there s a dried minced garlic, which one was i supposed to use?"
2001957707,155017,2018-01-28,5,"This is a wonderfully simple recipe. For fresh fish nothing is better. I would add: buy thick (1 inch thick) fish and very fresh. Go to a market that gets daily deliveries. I did add buttered cracker crumbs. Hey, i'm a New England girl. My paprika was smoky. I have never baked better fish."

1803399002,155017,2018-03-31,5,This is fabulous! Such a simple way to add flavor!
2002149737,155017,2018-05-12,5,"Made this last night - added frozen king prawns under haddock - delicious, yet delicate flavours flavours and aroma. Served with new potatoes and green beans - everyone loved this new dish."
2002298522,155017,2018-10-11,5,Great weeknight dish....came excellent and was perfectly seasoned...I highly recommend!!!
482376,330306,2011-05-19,5,Lovedddd this asparagus. The garlic flavored oil really helps to flavor the asparagus. I especially loved the toasted almonds (I used slivers). Yummy!
128473,208419,2007-02-21,5,"This is a nice smoothie, it was very quick and easy to make. I love the combination of lime, banana and strawberries. A nice refreshing drink, smooth, tart and very flavourful with a nice texture. Thanks for sharing."
324390,208419,2007-02-28,5,"The bananas and strawberries really shine in this smoothie! It was surprisingly sweet but not overly so. I had it for dessert, but it would make a great breakfast too. I'll make this again!"
107583,208419,2007-03-03,5,"Great combination of flavors.  Not too sweet, and a nice change from the yogurt-based smoothies.  I used frozen, unsweetened berries, un-thawed, so didn't have to chill before drinking."
430471,208419,2007-03-16,5,All I can say is YUMM! I used frozen strawberries and a few ice cubes to make it thicker.  But the taste was very light and refreshing. Reviewed for holiday tag.
340130,208419,2007-06-14,5,I used store bought juices and threw in a few frozen strawberries. Really nice and refreshing on a summer morning. I will definitely make this again. Thanks !
37449,208419,2007-08-10,5,"This is the way I make my smoothies, although the lime juice is a new addition. Loved it! Thank you!"
160974,208419,2007-10-27,5,"You can't go wrong with Ina! I've made this several times using fresh queezed juice/fruit and frozen. The fresh is superb but the frozen straw./commercial o.j. was almost as good, too. Thanks again, Juenessa!

Roxygirl"
204024,208419,2008-01-27,5,This is light and frothy. This was enjoyed by DH and DS for breakfast. The orange and banana came through more than other ingredients. Made for BT 2008
229524,208419,2009-03-27,5,WOW!!!!! Love this smoothie.  The flavors go well together.  A real nice fresh tasting drink. Like that you don't add any sugar.  I used some frozen strawberries so that made the drink cold enough that I didn't need to chill.
407007,208419,2009-12-27,4,"This was good. I used Simply Orange OJ and left out the lime juice. I used frozen strawberries. It was very good - a tiny bit tart though. I scaled the recipe down to 1 1/2 servings me for me for a nice 150 calorie smoothie, so I only put in 1/2 of a banana. Next time I will put in the whole thing for extra sweetness. Thanks for sharing!"
1657616,208419,2013-03-13,4,"Liked that there was no sugar added to this drink but the lime came through strong, maybe I put more than what was called for. Will make again though. Thanks!"
85018,59050,2003-07-11,4,"Couldn't find Lorna Doones, so I used pecan sandies.  Used less than the3/4C syrup, 'cause it looked like it would be too wet.  Also, used brown sugar just because I love the flavor.
This was very good.  We all liked it, small pieces 'cause it's very rich with the Pecan Sandies."
39835,59050,2003-07-12,5,"Excellent and so easy to make. This can be easily classified as an ""emergency desert"" to have when people drop in. Thanks Vicki for posting this recipe."
97010,59050,2003-08-02,5,Another easy winner!  
13593,59050,2008-08-02,5,"I made this a few years ago from the very same newsletter Vicki found the recipe in.  I was answering a recipe request and wondered if this recipe was somewhere on RecipeZaar.  It was!  This is such a delicious, easy cobbler.  I think anyone would like it."
838303,349421,2009-01-13,5,"Wow, mashed potatoes are my comfort food. These are great, keep those recipes coming Foodie Friend."
525420,349421,2009-08-23,5,"I tried these last night and they were wonderful. I never thought about cooking basic mash potatoes in a crock pot. When I cook for a holiday I have a lot going on and with these I don't have to watch them. I can even start them the night before. After I cooked and drained them I added the other ingredients and put them back into the slow cooker on low. I tripled the batch so I had a lot. They kept the same consistency  though out the day. They didn't dry out or stick to the bottom. This is not true when cooking on the stove top and it's one less burner I have to use. Everyone loved them and wanted to know how I did it. Thanks so much for sharing.
Allegra"
323328,349421,2009-10-04,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for!  Started these first thing in the morning and mashed them about 4pm for a 7pm supper.  I halved the recipe for 3 of us with leftovers and they came out great.  I will add that I used milk instead of half-and-half and added a fair amount more than in the recipe, but again, that is personal preference!  Perfect with cube steaks and gravy!  Thanks Foodie!"
1556803,349421,2010-02-19,5,I love this recipe!  Thank you Foodie Friend for posting it.  I love mashed potatoes.  I don't make them because I get off work around 5:30 (I work at home) and try to have dinner on the table between 6 - 6:30.  Now I can make mashed potatoes again.  I mashed the potatoes around 8:00 am put them in slow cooker on the keep warm setting.  They were perfect at 6:30.  The only problem I had was not eating them all before dinner.  This recipe is so good!
463435,349421,2010-11-26,5,"Made this recipe to free up space on the stove this Thanksgiving. The recipe was so simple to prepare, and everyone in the family enjoyed it. I love the fact that the entire recipe is made from start to finish in the crock pot. So many recipes I found were made on the stove top then transferred to the crock to be kept warm. I will continue to make this recipe for years to come. Thank you for posting this recipe."
192264,349421,2011-11-11,5,This was very good! I also loved being able to do everything in the crockpot. I also had to use a good bit more half-and-half. Thanks for posting.
2001576690,151686,2017-06-09,0,"Exellent! Next time I'm going to boil some cinnamon bark with orange rind and balsamic glaze, separately, and add to 1/2 the completed recipe for some variety! I cut back the sugar a bit, 'cuz my apricots were like booze, they were so ripe!"
82264,12276,2005-02-01,5,This was easy and delicious.  We are big fans of barley and always enjoy new ways to prepare it.  This was a winner.
95743,12276,2005-05-13,5,"Exceeded my expectations for such everyday ingredients.  I added peas, celery and leeks and used canned tomatoes and their juice.  Tasty way to use what's in the frig, Tebo."
294153,12276,2006-03-13,4,"This was very easy to make.  It is the first time I used my rice cooker for something other than rice.  It won't be the last, especially during the summer.  I followed the recipe as shown but added frozen mixed veggies."
301074,175067,2006-07-02,5,I made this recipe for the girls in my card club.  It was a hit! I used my Kitchenaide stand mixer which made it even more easy. I used triscutt-like crackers so there wouldn't be competition w/ the BLT.
97775,175067,2006-07-08,5,I used green onions and even MORE bacon. Don't omit the sugar - it kicks up the flavor!  A huge hit with friends and with my son's Dungeons & Dragons group.  I double when I make it now!
99336,175067,2006-08-25,5,"OMG!  This is TOO good.  I used green onions, and it brightened it up as well as taste.  "
111678,175067,2009-06-21,5,"I needed something different to take to a party, and picked this one because I had all the ingredients on hand.  Good choice!  It was a big hit with everyone.  It does get better as it sits and the flavors blend, so be sure to make it several hours before you need it!"
865936,135519,2009-06-06,4,Very good potato skins.  I did not cut them in half as instructed in step 4.  The only thing I would suggest is to salt and pepper the potatoes before adding the fillings.
1656811,135519,2010-07-23,0,I thought this was delicius! I thik it was just fine with out  salt and ppepper! But you do not need to have 6 large potatoes! I would not put tomatoes in them I did not think they tasted ery well wioth them in there! Also do not put chili powder in it! It makes it really hot! But it was a very good  mea!
1098529,390265,2009-09-17,5,Great & SOOOOOO Simple! I Made This With A Little 4 Yr. Old Girl I Babysit & She Loved It! She REALLY Loved The Fact That SHE Could Mix The Dry Ingredients. Thanks For The Great Recipe!
593927,390265,2010-02-22,4,"Served with plain rice milk for a good snack. I used gala apples and enjoyed how the apples were chopped not just sliced. I used freshly squeezed lemon juice, canola oil in replacement of butter though I know butter would be better. I made this gluten free using gluten free oats and Recipe #256259 using all white rice flour and tapioca starch. I replaced the pecans with walnuts and used a demerara dark brown sugar & sea salt. I think it would have been better a little less dark golden brown."
37449,398291,2009-11-18,5,"Oh yum! I really enjoyed the jalapeno vinegar! I usually buy jalapenos fresh and just slice and cover in a jar with cider vinegar(or white). This was great, thanks!"
131126,398291,2010-04-02,5,This worked well as a spread for chalupas.  Even with jalapeno vinegar it was pleasantly mild & allowed for additional hot sauce at the table for those who wanted it. Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring 2010 Pick A Chef.
108843,236346,2007-10-13,5,"A great proportional recipe for those of us who live alone. I will add it to my For two Cookbook. I used slightly less butter, as I had some leftover buttermilk that I used for this! It was great!! Next time I have company I want to impress, ahem,  I am gonna double this one, and I bet it will be perfect. Thanks for posting this one, 462. I hope you don't mind me using your first name!"
37779,236346,2008-03-02,4,"I picked this recipe for my step-son, who loves mashed potatoes and thinks they are hard to make.  Used two large potatoes and kept the remaining ingredients the same.  The only thing I would do differently is thickly slice the potatoes so it easier to tell when they are done. The end-product turned out well and my step-son can now make mashed potatoes whenever he wants them. Thanks."
913935,236346,2008-08-28,0,"This is a good one but, when adding the water to the pot, just cover the diced potato. And also use cold water to start for even temp when cooking. Also for those of us who want less fat, I recomend using molly mcbutter for that wonderful buttery taste without all the fat."
37449,236346,2011-05-03,5,"I left the peel on to get more vitamins, and sliced it to cook quicker. Easy, quick and very good! Thanks!"
1803179896,236346,2014-09-28,2,Add the milk slowly until you get the desired consistency.  If you just dump in 1/2 cup milk you&#039;ll get very bad results unless you have an unusually large potato.
197023,62370,2006-05-11,5,"I didn’t change a thing, and won't be next time that I make this either: we absolutely LOVED it.  This is a spinach recipe that THIS spinach lover – and I do try lots of spinach recipes! - will be making again and again.  How it's sat here – unreviewed and unacknowledged - for three years just amazes me!  I did add the bacon, as suggested and will do so again; bacon is a perfect complement to the other flavours.  Loved the nutmeg in this too.  A huge thank you for this one, Evelyn!"
296809,62370,2006-09-26,5,"This dish is spinach perfection! Like the other reviewer, DH & I esp liked the hint of nutmeg + the bacon. Every element works here & none of them overpower the others. It was dense & richly flavorful, but not heavy. I did use garlic salt for the sml amt of salt. This is far & away our favorite spinach dish & I doubt it will ever have to step aside for another. Way to go, Ev! Ty, ty, ty :-)"
81511,62370,2006-10-08,5,Very tasty indeed! The only thing I did different was to top the dish with extra cheese the last 10 minutes of baking. Will certainly be making this dish again. 
141293,62370,2006-10-17,4,"This tasted similar to my crustless spinach quiche.  Very simple to make, but I think it needs some onion or shallot added.  I also think I would prefer parmesan instead of cheddar.  Will make again with these changes.  Thanks Eve."
367438,62370,2006-10-20,4,"I adapted it a tad to reduce the fat and focus on the spinach by omitting the cream cheese, substituting skim milk for the half and half, substituting 1/2 cup of grated gruyere cheese for the cheddar, and greasing the pan with canola spray. Delish! "
232669,62370,2007-03-19,5,"Hello evelyn/athens, we loved this spinach! We have problems here with the residents not eating anything ""green"" or vegetables so when we prepared your recipe, a lot of the residents said that they liked it. A winner! We have been trying out a lot of creamed spinach recipes and so far yours is ""numero uno"". Just added a bit of grated onion and used gruyere cheese instead of cheddar(due to personal preference). Thanks for posting a winner of a recipe that is wonderful, Diane :=)"
500860,62370,2007-06-03,3,"I'm really just not sure how to rate this. We enjoyed it. I wish I had cut up the cream cheese into MUCH smaller bits (it was softened but stil clumped together and didn't ""melt"" out). I used matza meal instead of bread crumbs, but other than that followed the recipe perfectly (except for greasing a metal pie pan with pam olive oil cooking spray instead of using glass and butter, though I didn't have any sticking problems).

I don't know. I've had other spinach quiches and bakes. They all sort of taste alike. This was a bit special due to the nutmeg, perhaps.

Mine did not puff up like the picture at all. It barely rose, to be quite honest. It was rather flat, like the consistancy of a torte. But it was good. This was probably 3.5 stars but not quite a 4. It was good. Really good. I'd make it again and keep everything as is...but it just didn't BLOW me away enought to say that I LOVED it.

My husband didn't like it at all. He's not a big fan of spinach, though I have found ways to get it into our collective diets by using fresh spinach. 

In fact, now that I've said that, I think I would make this again with fresh spinach (TONS of it) and it might warrent the full 4 stars. I'll try it and repost...though it might take sometime before that happens.

My other dinner guest didn't care for it much, but I found it very convienent to reheat and reserve for lunch, dinner, or a snack.

This was good. It just wasn't WOW."
512532,62370,2007-08-23,5,I really loved this recipe. It was good cold as well. Make sure your cream cheese is softened so it doesn't leave lumps in the mixture. I suggest microwaving it for 10-20 seconds. Will definitely make this one again! I didn't have any half and half the second time I made this and used 1% milk and it still came out great and that reduces the amount of calories.
153750,62370,2007-11-10,4,"This was good but a little bland.  It could of had a little more of some type of spice, maybe a dash of red hot or some garlic.    It could wonderful and looked delicious.  I will try again!"
1381638,62370,2009-09-25,4,"I substituted light cream cheese, added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, and used garlic herb flavored bread crumbs.  The result was a very tasty and not a bit bland!  

I'll agree with the another comment and say make sure the cream cheese is softened and then well mixed otherwise you end up with globs of cream cheese here and there."
135511,62370,2010-02-07,5,"I make this all the time and my whole family loves it!!  I use fresh spinach, cook it and then chop it up and mix with other ingredients. I also double the recipe every time because it is such a hit and everyone always wants more. Thank you for giving me a way to pack in a lot of spinach in a little serving!!!!"
124449,367436,2009-04-24,5,"What a wonderful basing sauce!  I grilled a piece of salmon tonight for dinner and used this recipe for the glaze.  It was fabulous!  It was sweet, but the cayenne added a bit of spice.  I did use only about 2T butter because we like a thicker glaze, and that worked perfectly!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe, Kitten!  It's definitely one I'll use over and over."
461887,367436,2009-06-30,5,Delicious sauce!
125388,367436,2009-08-22,5,"I used this with grilled halibut steaks.  We loved the slightly sweet, slightly spicy taste this sauce added to the fish."
1248785,367436,2009-10-15,5,Great on salmon!
572152,367436,2009-11-04,5,Soooooooo good. I'm trying to incoporate more fish into my diet and this so hit the spot.  I tried it on Tilapia but tonight I'm doing it on grouper.  I'll update you all when it's done
2908267,367436,2013-07-31,5,I was amazed!  I used it on haddock to save calories.  It turns a bland fish into a&lt;br/&gt;Tasty fish and easy.
513169,341305,2009-02-27,5,"as a freinf of the food snob in Isreal i knew this would be a great recipy but i have to add how easy it was just but everything in the mixer and then bake! the only problem was they were gone as soon as they came out of the oven!
i used whole weat flour and i think next time i wioll cut the suger a bit to make them a bit more ""healthy"""
512532,341305,2013-05-15,5,So proud of my daughters for sharing this awesome recipe. It really came out delicious and so moist! Followed the recipe exactly and used my Emerson blender to mix along the way. I normally cut back on the sugar but didn&#039;t this time but might next time. Made some mini muffins and regular muffins. The minis took the whole 15 min and then some to cook. I added quite a bit more time for the regular sized muffins. Maybe another 8-10 min. cooking time.
60231,293117,2008-03-26,5,"I changed it a little, but we all loved it. I used ground chicken instead of beef, and since my daughter doesn't much care for spinach - she'll eat it grudgingly - I left that out and instead I sauteed some fresh baby portabellas and added those. Very nice and very easy.
Thanks."
56003,293117,2008-04-14,5,"Awesome!  Did make a small change as we love spinach!  Used 2 9 oz bags of fresh spinach and a little more sauce.  This was enjoyed by EVERYBODY!  All it needed was a green salad side and, of course, some garlic bread!"
504973,293117,2009-02-25,5,"We all loved this one!
So easy to make."
61660,136381,2008-06-21,5,Loved it!  I halved the recipe and served it with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Great flavor and I love the coconut!  Thanks Leslie!  Made for the Babes of ZWT4.
166642,136381,2008-06-22,5,This is really good! I love coconut so I knew I couldn't go wrong with this recipe. Made for ZWT4 for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers.
425677,136381,2008-06-23,4,"This was pretty good. It was very easy too make too.  I served it over vanilla ice cream.  I think I will omit the coconut next time, but other than that... very good.  Made for ZWT 4."
189643,136381,2005-10-19,5,"Yum yum yum!!! The toasted coconut on top was so good with the sweet, drippy bananas. Used the butter; this is a great recipe! Thanks!"
104472,136381,2005-10-22,5,Very good and very easy. Ihad 2 large bananas so I cut  the recipe in half and it worked fine. Grear for weekends with french toast.Thanks for posting!
197023,136381,2005-11-26,5,"WOW!  A fabulous and SO easy to make dessert - or an anytime snack!  I skipped the butter and used slightly more of both the lemon juice and orange juice.  It was equally delicious warm and at room temperature.  Just the right balance of sweetness and tartness.  I served it with a dollop of Greek yoghurt.  For some additional variety of texture, next time I make this I’m going to add some slivered almonds.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Simplicity at its best!"
5060,136381,2006-01-23,5,"Made this for a Sunday afternoon treat for DH. He says it's more than a 5 star, delicious!!
Very easy to make, looks and smells wonderful! I just did 2 bananas and he ate the whole thing!! Wish I could have tried it, thanks for sharing a keeper, he is already asking to have it again."
20480,136381,2006-06-19,5,"Great and easy recipe; I left the butter out; used only 2 bananas and reduced the other ingredients for 2.It's a keeper and very healthy. Thanks Leslie.
Rita"
288218,136381,2006-06-20,5,"A tasty and easy dessert! The combination of banana and coconut is excellent. I make the whole portion 5 bananas and I'm so glad I did. A keeper, Leslie!"
130133,136381,2006-08-12,5,A nice dessert when you don't want something heavy.  Thanks for sharing!
214855,136381,2006-09-08,5,Had this for dessert last night. Very yummy. I left out the margarine and it was not missed by anone. Served with vanilla ice-cream.
380466,136381,2008-06-23,4,This was to put together and it was pretty good! I made for ZWT 4 and we had to substitute something else instead of the sugar. So I used honey drizzled on it for sweetness. Thanks for posting!
80353,136381,2008-06-23,4,Simple and tasty.  I made this for our breakfast and served over oatmeal.
130819,136381,2008-06-23,5,Bananas and toasted coconut does it for me! Easy to make dessert treat.  Added a dollop of yoghurt. Good thing I only made half - I would have ate it all!
424680,136381,2008-06-24,5,"Couldn't be nicer ~ EASY PREP & GREAT TASTE! I always enjoy a citrus flavor & these two were wonderful in combo with the bananas & coconut! Definitely a keeper, whether for good dessert or a tasty breakfast! Thanks for posting it! [Made & reviewed while touring Africa on the Zaar World Tour 4]"
324390,136381,2008-06-25,5,This made a terrific snack. A breeze to put together with nice results. I added a touch of cinnamon to go with the brown sugar. I also cut bakc on the butter/margarine a bit. Made for ZWT 4 by a Jefe de la Cocina.
422893,136381,2008-06-27,5,"Yum, I made this for the African dessert challenge only I had it for breakfast, subbed Splenda for the sugar and served with some vanilla yoghurt for a breakfast that was most enjoyed. ZWT 4."
29655,136381,2008-06-27,5,Hubby didn't like this but this got such rave reviews that his vote doesn't count this time.  I used the Splenda Brown sugar blend and it worked just fine.  The juices make the most delightful flavoring for this dish.  Thanks for a keeper!  This will definitely get a repeat performance at our home.  Reviewed for ZWT4.
428885,136381,2008-06-27,5,"Just as yummy as I thought, and totally a breeze to make. I halved this the first time, but doubled it for our gang on the farm. Both ways turned out just perfectly. I didn't however cut back on the butter/margarine when I doubled it. I melted the butter and then dribbled it over accordingly, and between the brown sugar and the orange juice/ and coconut this was so wonderful! Thanks for a siple but terrific treat, Leslie! Made for *ZWT4* June 2008."
385678,136381,2008-06-28,5,"This was really good.  It took me about 20 minutes or so to bake, but maybe it's because I used freshly shredded coconut and so it was still a little moist.  My family enjoyed this with some banana bread and ice cream.  Thanks!  Made for ZWT4 - Jefes de la Cocina."
211184,136381,2008-06-29,5,"Fast, easy, and delicious! I made this recipe in individual ramekins. I quartered the bananas then cut lenthwise. I drizzled honey over each ramekin vs the brown sugar.
This was a real treat Leslie, thank you! Made for ZWT4"
136726,136381,2008-06-29,5,"Great, as the others fast easy and delicious. what more could you ask for. I made this as directed and serve with frozen yogurt.Will make this again. Thank you"
383346,136381,2008-06-30,5,This is really good even though DH didn't like.  He said there was something in it he didn't like.  But he couldn't tell what precisely.  I loved the tangy taste from the orange and lime (yes I used lime juice).  I used butter.  I loved the addition of coconut.  Thanks Leslie.  Made for the Babes of ZWT4
69904,136381,2008-07-01,5,"Yummy!  This pleased both the kids and adults at our house and will be made again.  Followed the recipe, except for using butter.  This has a nice blend of flavors and textures.  We served it as a dessert but it will make breakfast something to look forward to also.  = )
  Thanks my friend!!
  For the Cookin' Cats ZWT4"
227607,136381,2008-07-07,5,Made for ZWT4...This was wonderful.  I think I will try it with a little rum added to it for an adult dessert next time.
677508,136381,2008-07-11,5,Wow!  A really nice dessert that was so yummy!  So quick and easy to make too!  We enjoyed this tonite for an African themed dinner and look forward to making it again.  Made for ZWT4.
306797,136381,2008-07-16,5,"Fabulously easy & tasty dessert.  I added some frozen mango pieces, also cut back on the sugar because my coconut was sweetened.  Thanks Leslie for sharing this keeper."
89549,136381,2008-07-19,5,"This is fabulous!  Quick and easy.  Next time I will add a few chopped nuts, and serve with whipped cream or ice cream for a hot banana split!
Thanks for the inspiration!"
718620,136381,2008-07-22,2,"the bananas came out mushy when i baked it - it was an ok flavor, but, just not really what i was expecting"
1376400,136381,2009-10-25,5,If you use very ripe bananas it will turn out very mushy and watery. However it tastes great (esp with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream).
1790442,136381,2011-01-09,0,"A most delicious breakfast.<br/>If you only have ripe bananas, DO NOT BAKE.<br/>Unless you like the consistency of baby food.<br/>It tastes fine if you don't bake it.<br/>Also good atop oatmeal."
573325,136381,2011-01-30,5,"This is such a yummy recipe! It is juicy, fruity, sweet and comforting! Mmmm! The bananas go so great with the coconut. YUM!<br/>I made half the recipe for my sis and me and it was very generous. Instead of orange juice I used apple juice and I also left out the sugar. But other than that followed your recipe to a t and loved it!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing it here with us!<br/>Made and reviewed for I Recommend Tag Game January 2011."
1588002,136381,2011-05-23,4,The flavor was outstanding. The banana and coconut always work well and the tangy orange / lemon is a nice contrast. I was hoping that the juice might cook down a little more. It ended up thin. I think I will try and mash up one of the banana segments into the orange juice before adding to the dish to see if that helps. Thanks ~Leslie~ this was great.
358513,136381,2011-08-03,5,I had some raisins and dates soaking in orange juice already for a couple days so I used some juice from that and added in the dates and raisins and the coconut and a little coconut juice and raw sugar and let it reduce down. I served over plain yogurt. It's similar to what I do with the soaked fruit except has beautiful baked bananas in it. A definite improvement. Next time I'll try it on some rice pudding or ice cream. Thank you. Made for Ramadan Tag 2011.
593927,136381,2012-01-30,5,"Yummy for breakfast with plain thick yogurt for DD1 (4 years old) and I. I used butter in place of the (soy laden) margarine to be healthier, freshly squeezed lemon juice, nice thick shredded coconut, plus the rest of the ingredients. I may make this again!!"
376986,136381,2012-08-28,1,"edible, but not good.  The coconut was too dry."
486725,136381,2013-03-21,4,"Used lime in this and the flavor was really good. I halved the coconut, since it seemed like plenty. Vanilla ice cream with this is a must!"
2677355,136381,2014-03-10,5,"This was delicious! We ate it atop our pancakes in place of syrup and it was just perfect. I was especially thrilled because I love bananas but can&#039;t eat them raw due to a sensitivity. I used SimplyOrange juice with mango which gave it one extra tropical flavor. I only had 3 bananas but didn&#039;t cut back on the other ingredients so it was nice and saucy which was great. There&#039;s just enough left over to have with ice cream or oatmeal tomorrow. Thanks for posting, Leslie!"
41578,316026,2008-09-24,5,"What a great way to use up those green tomatoes!   I couldn't find Drakes Fry Mix so I used the cornmeal and they turned out perfectly.  Then next time I make them, I will add a bit of cajun seasoning for hubby.  Great recipe, faith.  This is a keeper!"
157425,316026,2009-09-15,5,I bought some green tomatoes from our local farmer's co-op because my family had never had fried green tomatoes. Put the tomatoes in the refrigerator overnight to chill and made them for a Saturday afternoon snack. Tripled the recipe and did find the Drakes's fry mix so used that with a bit of fresh ground pepper added. We all enjoyed the tomatoes and loved the crispy coating. Also drained them on a paper towel before serving. Thank you so much sweetie for sharing your Grandma's recipe! Made and reviewed for Adopt A Tag 2009.
4439,504948,2013-07-30,0,"Sounds interesting, and something I would try, but the carbs and cholesterol values are beyond my weekly limit, so i will have to pass."
244191,132462,2005-11-30,5,"DELICIOUS...should be in top 5 cakes of all time. Easy to make, directions easy to follow and bake time was right on the mark. It was soooooo good that half of it was inhaled by my husband alone and that was the first helping without the icing...maybe next time I can try it with icing. It has a permanent home in my recipe book of favorites."
763736,301835,2008-08-26,5,"Easy, quick, and delicous!  I used a can of peaches in heavy syrup, and chopped them up to a smaller size.  A full 5 stars from me.  Thank you!"
56003,166297,2008-11-22,5,"Top notch!  Made exactly per instructions.  No need to change a thing.  Will make a wonderful appy for the holidays.  Thnx so much for posting, Stacey.  Made for Fall 2008 My-3-Chefs."
573325,273401,2009-01-27,5,"WOW! This is just outstanding! I made it yesterday with sunflower seeds instead of the cheese and tasted it today before using it for Recipe #281246 and it was sooooooo good! The flavours of parsley and basil blend so well and the touch of garlic really sets it off! This was my first attempt at making pesto myself and Im so glad that you shared your recipe! 
Made for Went to the Market Tag 2009."
678366,273401,2010-04-28,5,"I used frozen basil and I love this pesto so much! I love there's no pine nuts,which are very hard to find here.Loula's sub is interesting,I'll have to try that too.thanks for sharing."
488441,301835,2008-09-02,5,"Fantastic! This will be my new go to recipe for desserts. This is so easy and tasty. I did have a problem trying to decide what temp the oven should be since it says 45 minutes but doesn't give a temp. I baked my cobbler for 65 minutes in a 350 degree oven. I checked it every five minutes because I didn't want it to burn or get too brown. This is a great, easy, inexpensive recipe, and I always have the ingredients on hand. I think you could use blueberry pie filling or others to switch it out a bit. Thanks so  much for posting."
727055,301835,2009-03-27,5,"Oh what a delicious way to use up that stray can of peaches that got lost in the back of the cupboard! This was so quick and easy. I used a large can, 29 oz., and drained the extra juice. I also lightly greased an 8x8 baking dish and this fit exactly. I thought there was going to be too much topping, but after baking, it was just perfect. Served this with cool whip or vanilla ice cream. Made this for Spring PAC 09. Thank you for sharing , this made it into my keeper file!"
614514,301835,2009-09-17,4,"This was good and super easy, but too sweet and buttery for my taste. Next time I will try decreasing the sugar and butter and increase the flour a bit. I used fresh peaches which worked well. The bake time was perfect."
458757,301835,2012-05-14,5,This was great and so easy!!!  Thanks for a great easy recipe!!!
1154749,331056,2009-02-02,5,I tried this and it was simply amazing! The oatmeal was a very interesting twist to an old classic and I like your energy and penchant for trying new and interesting combination's. Im sure people are always asking for you to bake for them. Keep up the innovation!
1259066,331056,2010-01-31,5,"I just finished baking this loaf and it is very good.  I follwed the recipe exactly and it came out moist and delicious.  I made it into 2 loaves (1 larger and 1 mini), so I could taste it, as I was baking it for a friend who recently came home from the hospital.  (I didn't want to give something that I hadn't tried.)  Loved it, will make it again.  Loved the low fat, the addition of oats, whole wheat flour and yogurt...a new healthier twist on an old school recipe.  Thanks Ashley."
144645,331056,2010-08-12,5,"I made a double batch of this recipe to use up some bananas that had gone past the point of kids eating them.  I followed the recipe with the theseexceptions: Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar, non-fat vanilla yogurt and AP Flour instead of wheat.  Everyone is enjoying the bread and I am sure these loaves will be gone in no time!  Thank you, Ashley.  I am going to try to substitue light evoo for the butter next time."
91392,331056,2011-05-27,4,Good for a healthy recipe.  Moist and I like the consistency the oatmeal gives it.
2249465,331056,2012-04-27,0,"I substituted olive oil for the butter, used 1/2 the sugar (1/2 cup Sugar in the Raw only) and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  The bread remains moist and is plenty sweet.  Next time I'll double the amount of cinnamon (2 tsp).  I slice the bread, freeze the individual slices and toast it in the morning for a quick breakfast before dashing to work."
1836016,331056,2013-02-11,5,"We loved this!!! I didn't have plain yogurt so I used fruit yogurt and skipped the sugar (just used the brown sugar), otherwise followed the recipe as is. My family devoured this in one sitting. Love how healthy and delicious it is."
133174,356244,2009-03-26,4,This made a quick and easy side for recipe #359548.  The recipe was reduced by half.  The oil was omitted and some dried onion flakes were added for extra flavor and personal taste.  Made for *PAC 2009*
540492,356244,2009-02-24,5,"I was going to post my family's Pilaf, but decided to check and see if it was here first, and I came across this recipe.  I've been making Armenian Pilaf all my life (both my parents are full-Armenian, so it's in the blood), in fact, I was 17 before I learned that rice is white; I had always eaten Pilaf, which is more a beige-yellow color...ah, well, live and learn.  Anyway, this is the exact list of the ingredients that we use for our pilaf, except that we use all butter, not the butter/oil combination.  For salt, we prefer to taste the boiling broth before adding salt as some broths (including homemade) are saltier than others, so it's better to taste before salting.  But the difference in the preparation is that we add the rice to the vermicelli and saute until nutty and fragrant, and the vermicelli is reddish in color.  Next, add (very hot or boiling) broth to the mixture, give it a quick stir, and cover for EXACTLY 20 minutes for white, long-grain rice.  White rice cannot be cooked for 45 minutes; it will turn to mush and burn.  After cooking, remove from heat, place a paper napkin or paper towel directly on top of the pilaf, replace pot lid, and allow to rest for about 5 minutes.  This makes for perfect, fluffy rice.  Don't know why it works, but my great-aunt taught us to do this and it's always been flawless.  The flavor of this pilaf is...perfection.  It's wonderful as is, or as a base for stroganoff, beef or lamb stew, along-side chicken, with pork chops and gravy, with just about anything.  One final note, 1 cup of rice grows to 2 cups (not 3) after cooking, which would make 4 servings (not 6).  Thank you for posting this authentic and delicious recipe.  I'm sure others will appreciate it, too."
1184067,356244,2009-03-14,4,"I've made this twice now, both times with butter as suggested. Once prepared as recipe suggested the other time I browned the rice in the skillet before adding boiling water/broth as suggested by rosie posie. Both times it turned out great. We def. will be eating this again and again :) Thanks for the post"
250031,356244,2013-02-02,4,"I made this tonight as an accompaniment to Fillet of Sole in White Wine (Recipe #84730). I've never had Armenian Pilaf before so I'm just rating based on how we liked it. My husband and I enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again, with a few of my own tweaks. I used angel hair (as that is what I had on hand) and macadamia oil in place of the safflower as I had a gift bottle from Hawaii. I also browned the rice in the skillet with the pasta. Very nice flavors! I think I want to add something else for additional punch ... maybe garlic powder or some herbs. That may not make it authentic ""Armenian Pilaf"" but it will please our palates. :)  Thank you for posting!"
119466,155496,2006-07-03,5,"I typically don't like potatoes ""baked"" in the microwave, but don't always plan far enough ahead to bake them in the oven. This is a very nice compromise. The microwave time will probably need to be adjusted according to the size of your potato and wattage of your microwave. Thanks for posting! "
51011,155496,2006-08-17,5,"I was really in the mood for baked potatoes from the oven tonight but didn't want to wait forever.  I cooked 3 potatoes (2 for tonight, one for lunch tomorrow) in my microwave on the baked potato setting (almost 12 minutes).  Then I cooked them in a 400 oven for 20-25 minutes.  Yum!!!  Tasted like I had cooked them for longer!  This will be a keeper.  Thanks for sharing."
327445,155496,2006-09-26,5,"I was very impressed with this. I put 3 potatoes in the microwave for about 10 minutes, then brushed on some oil with garlic powder, wrapped them in foil, and put them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. The inside was soft and moist, but the skin was a little chewy. Topped with chili, cheese, sour cream, and broccoli. Yum!"
104295,155496,2007-06-27,5,This worked out beautifully.  I almost never have baked potatoes because they take so long to bake.  But this was lovely.  I did three potatoes and then we had a baked potato bar for lunch.
93997,155496,2007-09-18,5,"These turned out great. Great way to cut the cooking time. You can also do them in the microwave entirely and they are pretty good that way as well. But I thought this method taste better than simply microwaving. Thanks for the recipe, will make again!"
789388,155496,2008-03-14,5,"I was getting ready to post a review for this recipe, which by the way I've used for the last two evenings. And noticed I'd been skipping a step!!  LOL!!
So I can safely say, IF you want to pass the ""brush with olive oil"" step, they will still turn out light, fluffy and wonderful. 
i don't know if it makes a difference but I used Russets. And I will tell you without a doubt I will never back a potato any other way again. Except, I might try the ""brush with olive oil step"".  LOL!!"
864044,155496,2008-08-01,5,"I have made my potatoes like this for years. But I don't brush them with olive oil, I just pop them in some aluminum foil and stick in the oven while I'm grilling the steaks or fixing whatever needs to be fixed."
166294,155496,2010-03-24,5,"So good!!  I tried these because of Marg's photo and review.  Why have I never thought of using the microwave first and then the oven??  I have always wanted that salty, crunchy skin but didn't want to wait an hour or more for oven potatoes.  I'm using this method from now on.  Thank you!"
124416,155496,2010-03-28,5,"Hmmm. . . I thought I was the only one who knew this sneaky little secret,  been doing this for years!  I just nuke the potatoes about halfway (I don't even use the paper towel) then oil or butter the skin. Sprinkle with Montreal steak seasoning if you like it.   Finish in the oven.  Or if there is a REAL time crunch, nuke to almost done and then continue as above.  Thanks for posting; I guess everybody should know this method . . . . Janet"
26512,155496,2010-03-29,5,"I've been using this method for many years. I do add onion powder, cracked black pepper and onion salt to the skin. This is a great recipe if your main dish needs to bake for 30 minutes or so. You can just microwave the potatoes for a bit less time and then toss in the oven with your main dish. I just toss mine right on the rack."
1535,155496,2010-04-15,5,"This was a great way to get a perfect baked potato in a short amount of time! My only problem was 8 minutes in the microwave was waaaaay too long for my potato. The first one was so shriveled up, I had to throw it away. For the second one, I used the automatic baked potato setting & it only took about 4 minutes for it to be done. So make sure you check your potato early! Since I was also making Recipe #50847 to go with our steaks, only having the oven on for 15 minutes worked really well. I loved how crisp the skin got because of the oil. In fact, once I was getting full, I scraped the rest of the potato out so I could finish eating the skin instead. It was excellent! I'll use this method often. UPDATE: This method also works well on the grill. I put my potato just at the edge of the coals and turned it halfway through and it turned out lovely!"
88099,155496,2012-01-20,5,"Oh gosh what a great way to have baked potatoes and so easily.  After microwaving mine, I brushed with the oil and lightly sprinkled with Kosher Salt and fresh black pepper.  Excellent.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for cookbook tag game."
28201,24215,2002-05-15,3,"Good, but could benifet from some added spices or vegtables such as garlic or onion.  Not having had Armenian food before, maybe this is supposed to be a ""plain"" side dish to other foods."
60992,24215,2002-11-29,5,This is the exact recipe an Armenian friend gave to me. I always use it when I make Easma Kufta to put the meatballs over. The only thing I do differently is cook it in a skillet. It is perfect as is! Easy and quick.
29203,24215,2005-11-05,4,"Oh, yes! When it comes to good, plain is best. We like to use a little bit of oil when frying the noodles. I then add the butter in later."
369597,24215,2008-05-11,5,We make this all the time at home. We use orzo instead of the vermicelli ( no breaking up the pasta)
929074,24215,2009-03-09,5,This was a fantastic recipe.  You were right about it coming out perfect.  I used fedellini(?) noodles for it and everybody loved it.  This will be my go-to rice recipe.  Thanks!
61569,24215,2009-10-06,5,Perfect rice pilaf!  I added a clove of garlic (minced) to the butter.  Used Japanese medium/short grain rice from California along with angel hair pasta. The rice I used needed about 25 minutes to cook at simmer.  Thank you MizzNezz for posting this recipe!
2010614,24215,2012-08-22,5,"Great, simple recipe.  It really shines with homemade stock.  Using this recipe as a base, you can let your imagination run wild with various seasonings, onion, herbs, mushrooms, etc...  Every cook should have this one in their back pocket."
383346,24215,2012-10-02,5,"This rice is just perfect.  There is no need to add soy sauce when eating.  My son always wants to add soy sauce but for this rice, he didn't ask for the bottle.  Thanks MizzNezz"
2002098227,24215,2018-04-06,5,I did not change a thing and it came out perfect. Loved it served as a side dish to my chicken and broccoli casserole tonight! I used Swanson chicken broth and Publix supermarket brand fine Egg Noodles. This recipe is a keeper.
350938,434212,2010-08-18,5,"What an excellent idea, your hands don't get all sticky this way. It turned out perfectly cooked. thanks for sharing. This is my new way of cooking corn on the cob!!"
383346,434212,2010-08-23,5,This is a great way to cook the corn.  It turned out perfect.  Thanks Deb :)  Made for Holiday tag
678366,434212,2010-09-27,5,"I loved this way of making corn! No more mess while cleaning it.Here being cold,we managed to get more corn from my parents's little garden. Thanks for this great tip,I'll make sure to use it more next year."
226863,434212,2010-12-11,5,"So easy, how can you not give it a five!  My corn turned out very juicy.....juice squirted out with every bite....rare this late in the season for my area.  I'll definitely do this again.  I did pull the husks back and remove the silks before returning the husks to the corn and baking...also washed the corn...don't know if this affected the recipe, but mine turned out great!"
212609,434212,2011-01-17,5,"Stand up and take a bow Deb....this is a brilliant way of cooking corn!<br/>I've baked corn before, usually slathered in a flavoured butter and wrapped up in tin foil, or in the husk with some sort of addition to it...but never on it's own.<br/>I also pulled back the husks, to remove the silks...then I popped them onto my new baby..the Weber Q. <br/>They came out wonderfully...and I have to admit that I was a little surprised about HOW well they came out.<br/>I only cooked two, as DD seems to have gone off corn, and DS has wobbly teeth, and some missing, so eating corn isn't on option for him at the moment...or so I thought!!!<br/>DH hung on to his cob, but whenever I put mine onto my plate to eat something else, a little hand would stretch out, grab it, nibble it and pop it back again...between the two of them, they didn't leave much for me. That's a recommendation in itself!!<br/>I'm definitely converted...no need to swamp them in butter, when they come out so juicy and tender this way. Thanks again Deb.<br/>Made for PRMR."
452940,434212,2011-05-06,5,"Easiest way to fix corn on the cob there is. I didn't bother removing the silks, no need. The few that were still there came off with ease. Thanks for a keeper recipe."
560491,434212,2011-06-28,5,"This coen is great!  I already had the oven going for some bread so thew the corn in with it.  It got hot and cooked completely and not all watery like when I boil it.  Will be making this more often!  I did clean some of the silk off, pulled the husks down about 1/2 way; didn't seem to bother it.  Made for PRMR."
1058097,434212,2011-07-18,5,"There are only two ways I will ever make corn on the cob.  One is grilled.<br/>This is the other.  <br/>Baking makes the corn taste rich and sweet, not watered-down like boiled corn.  It's the best way to make corn when the weather precludes grilling.  For me this is the only way to cook corn indoors.  <br/>Thanks for posting!"
318262,434212,2011-08-07,5,Perfect and low maintenance way of cooking corn! This was so sweet and juicy. I topped it with some garlic-chili butter for a fantastic side. Thanks for this great method.
284897,434212,2012-01-11,5,"Deb, This is a wonderful way of cooking corn.<br/>I used the Barbie and it worked so very well!<br/>And butter over the top...........Just divine!<br/>Thanks for posting Deb.............. Awesome, simple and delcious!"
363055,434212,2013-06-24,5,"Perfect corn.  Easy, no mess and delicious!!"
179980,434212,2015-06-12,5,So easy and so good. I did run water over the corn  before pitting in oven.
573325,422784,2010-05-10,5,"Starry, this is a wonderful spring pasta recipe!!!!
It tastes so fresh and yummy that I really couldnt stop eating! :)
I luved the ease of preparation and the wonderful layers of flavour all the different ingredients added to this dish.
I made a few slight changes due to what I had on hand: Used cashews instead of pecans and left out the oil as I blanched the asparagus before blending.
This will be made time and time again in our house!
THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this smashing recipe with us!
Made and reviewed for New Kids On The Block Tag Game May 2010."
39835,422784,2010-07-27,3,"This was okay and great for a busy rainy day but I felt it was missing something -- maybe more garlic -- not sure. I skipped the nuts and used fat-free blue cheese instead of the parmesan, so it may have been that. Thanks for sharing!"
143318,422784,2013-07-09,5,"Fantastic - I was surprised how good this was, and quick to make. Very fresh tasting with the raw asparagus!"
260166,133919,2006-02-18,5,This was very good and it took minimal effort to prepare. The sauce was terrific. Make sure you don't use thick sliced bacon or else it will take too long to cook and the asparagus will be overdone. (I learned this from experience!) It was a hit with the whole family even the little ones.
204024,133919,2007-10-11,5,This is very good and very festive. I made this exactly as stated for my husbands birthday breakfast.  He loved it!  Made for Pac Fall 2007.
330545,133919,2007-12-02,5,"Served with eggs and toast points, this was the star of our Sunday breakfast! I did use a slice and half bacon per bundle and these were gone before anything else was even touched.  This delicious recipe goes into my permanet file and will be repeated often.  Thanks for a great recipe."
322571,133919,2008-06-25,1,"I'm not sure what went wrong, what with the other glowing reviews.  I made this exactly as written, used regular (not thick) bacon, etc.  After more than an hour in the oven at 325F the bacon was still not cooked, and the asparagus was destroyed.  We tried our best to eat it but had to throw it away and just had eggs and toast.  I'm sorry.  I don't ususally feel this way about a recipe.  Especially one that looks so good!"
146284,133919,2008-12-27,5,"This was an elegant presentation and a tasty side dish for Christmas dinner. Because I can't stand flabby bacon, I partially precooked the bacon, and I have to say that the recipe was fabulous."
668757,246604,2007-12-17,5,"i'm going to try this tonight with the recipe for basic meatloaf mix (#8099), we love potatoes in our home and can't get enough of them. thank you for a very easy recipe."
482376,246604,2009-03-27,4,"Sometimes simplicity is best. What caught my attention with this recipe is: the cooking temp. and the use of butter. Both of which, I've never tried. I usually just bake mine at 350 degrees, either plain or with a little olive oil. So I was intrigued by this technique. I think the higher cooking temp. and butter lended to a nice crispy skin on the potatoes, which I love. Thank you for posting this technique. It was great! ~Made for PAC Spring 2009~"
305531,246604,2011-08-22,5,Simple and good. Nice and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Thanks CipherBabe for a nice side. Made for All You Can Cook Buffet special.
409184,276454,2008-01-19,4,"This really was quite tasty! I certainly enjoyed the salad, but loved the dressing more. I will be using it tonight to top off some pan-fried chicken and later as veggie dip. Tastes nice and fresh! Thanks Lavender Lynn for posting! Made for Photo Swap."
37449,276454,2008-12-07,5,Loved the dressing! I used iceberg lettuce and veggie bacon bits. Thanks Lynn! :D
1072593,276454,2009-05-25,5,Salads for the rest of the year!  That's my promise after ZWT5.
315565,276454,2009-05-28,5,Fabulous salad and my avocado was just perfect and ready to use so this was such a timely recipe.My only addition was diced cucumber - made for ZWT 5.
865936,276454,2009-06-02,4,"Great salad.  I love the BLT with the avocado.  This a really good flavor combination and so easy to achieve.  I used fresh squeezed lemon juice, made a paste with fresh garlic and a little salt, and did use more than the 2 drops of hot pepper sauce!  Very nice.  For the salad I used Romaine.  Made for ZWT5."
56003,276454,2009-07-07,5,"I'm going to rate his now, even though I haven't put it on the salad.  Everyone knows what salad with bacon tastes like.  However, this dressing is way over the top!  I did make a few adjustments due to personal taste.  Used 1/2 tsp chopped fresh garlic, 1/4 tsp sea salt, and 1/4 tsp fresh ground peppercorn medley. Will have this again, Lavender Lynn.  Thnx for posting.  Made for Comfort Cafe Summer 2009."
88099,276454,2009-07-26,4,"This was a very tasty dressing, but I don't think my avocado must have not been big enought because it didn't have a lot of avocado flavor.  I'll add two of them next time.  However, the salad was enjoyed with fresh tomatoes from the garden.  Thanks for sharing.  :)"
60124,276454,2011-04-27,5,"I used 2 avos for this, as the dressing is strong and overpowered just one. I didnt use the hot sauce, but I noticed a few people adding sweet chilli sauce. Had this with a medley of salads, and some people used it as a filling for a wrap, definately gonna keep that in mind! made for Aussie swap, April 2011"
266635,276454,2015-01-19,5,"Made this yummy salad dressing to go with our dinner tonight.  Since my avocados were on the small size, I used two as did another reviewer.  I also used some fresh salsa vs. the hot sauce along with some S &amp; P.  This dressing could be used on a number of things so I will definitely keep it handy.  Made for the For Your Consideration tag game."
266635,473803,2013-04-03,5,"Made this delicious smoothie for breakfast today.  The avocado adds a subtle taste to the smoothie and makes it very creamy and healthy.  Next time I will reduce the sugar and/or add a sweetener such as Truvia.  Easy to make and very filling.  Made for Spring PAC, March, 2013."
186086,176911,2006-08-31,4,Nice recipe and very easy.  I used lemon extract instead of the vanilla and they turned out very good.   
485109,327904,2009-04-29,4,"If you're looking for healthy and refreshing, this is it! I had never frozen a banana before and a potato masher would only go through partially frozen bananas, but if you catch them just before they are done freezing, it's ideal. I think next time I'll try adding chocolate sauce swirls, just to negate the fact that it's healthy! Made for Zaar's Newest Tag."
1305016,327904,2009-06-24,0,This is a great alternative to adding Yohgurt to a fruit salad! also if your eating raw this recipe takes away the monotony of just picking up fruit and eating it !
1072593,327904,2009-08-02,5,"This does melt pretty quickly. Louisiana heat doesn't do it justice, either. You gotta try this and rediscover the banana. You'll never look at it in the same light again. Made for PRMR."
678366,327904,2009-12-11,5,This is one of those it's so easy it's silly and still so yummy recipes . Served it with granola and loved every bite of it.
1356721,327904,2010-06-05,5,"Super yummy!  All of my favorite ingredients in one dish - you shouldn't have, Syd!  I'm lazy so I put this in the food processor & probably took a couple months off the life of that thing.  Nevertheless this was delicious!  I topped it with banana slices and raw pistachios and ate it as an appetizer.  I think tomorrow I will add a carob sauce topping and have it for breakfast :)  Thanks!!!  Made for Veggie Swap 23!"
593927,327904,2010-06-18,5,I love this!!! DD (toddler) liked it a lot as well. Raw is what I was looking for & simple too. Doesn't this little recipe just fit?!! I used Mindelicious' idea and topped with pistachio nuts that looked lovely green on top as you can see in her picture. I think next time I will do exactly the same as her and add sliced bananas. This time I added fresh blueberries but it didn't really go.. I will definitely make this again and again.
573325,327904,2011-05-21,5,"WOW, wow, wow! This recipe is just awesome! I cannot believe that one can make banana ice-cream that is creamy, thick and sinfully delicious just like that at home! Its so cool! Ill be making this often trying out different add-ins and flavour combinations. :)<br/>Like Prose I had to thaw my bananas a bit before being able to mash them, but I found that crushing them between my fingers (in a plastic bag) worked wonderfully. <br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this true keeper with us, Syd!<br/>Made and reviewed for WTTM May 2011."
1922888,327904,2011-06-01,0,"cut very thin slices of a banana, freeze the slices, and throw in a food processor until the banana starts whipping up. You are going to have to scrape the sides like 4 times but the end result is creamy like real banana ice cream!!! try it!"
482376,327904,2013-02-03,5,Excellent! This satisfies any dessert cravings in a healthy way. Yummy. I think I will run my frozen bananas through the food processor next time to get the texture even creamier. Thank you!
68460,94128,2004-07-24,5,"Oh My....what a nice cake!  My guests and family loved it and my kids polished off the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  I made this as written, including the delicious caramel frosting.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks Earnie for a lovely cake recipe!"
73894,94128,2004-08-05,4,"This was an absolutely fantastic recipe.  I baked it for my son's first birthday party and it was demolished.  At least four people asked me for the recipe for the icing!  Incidentally, that *was* the one thing I changed.  I used significantly less powdered sugar--I just stopped adding sugar when I reached the desired consistency (I think it was more like 2.5 cups of sugar).  

Thank you so much for this great recipe!"
125458,94128,2005-08-09,4,"this was really good, and the frosting was really the icing on the cake! the penuche was a welcome variation on the tired cream cheese frosting that regularly adorns my banana and carrot cakes. i will be  using it again for sure. i added some walnuts to the batter to, to please my husband. we both really liked this."
189616,94128,2006-01-14,5,"Fantastic!! Small pieces are required since this is a very heavy cake. I even allowed my eldest DS a piece of this for breakfast-it DOES have bananas in it afterall...I think next time I may add Maple Extract and Walnuts. 
Thank You!"
149363,94128,2006-01-24,5,"This is just the BEST cake, and the icing is awesome, it really made the cake for us!!
I added chocolate chips to half of this cake, for my daughter and husband. A moist, delicious cake that will be the ONLY banana cake I ever make again! Thanks for a great recipe!"
292131,94128,2006-02-09,5,This was a great recipe.  I've never made a banana cake before and my DH loves caramel.  Everyone demolished this cake. I'm going to always make this cake for every occasion I can think of.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar when preparing the frosting and it was still delicious.  I also used cake flour which made the cake very light and moist. Thank you for such a great recipe!
163077,94128,2006-06-13,5,"Made mine in 2, 2lb loaf pans. Make's it easy to slice for hubby's lunch box. The icing is the best.
Thinking of making more and freezing them without the icing."
38745,94128,2006-08-31,5,"I made this yesterday and served it today.  I picked it because I was stumped for a recipe and when looking at this recipe, I had everything in my kitchen and the bananas in the freezer.  I made one change.  I didn't read the directions for the frosting all the way through and I made the cake late and said I could get up early to do the frosting.  Well I didn't realize I needed to let the cooked portion cool before adding the confectioners sugar.  So at 5:00 a.m. I knew I didn't have the time.  Luckily I had a can of caramel frosting in the cupboard. I followed everything else to the T.  This was very moist and had a wondeful flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe."
430236,94128,2007-06-18,5,"Made this cake for a potluck and it was a hit! The only substitutions I made were butter instead of margarine, and almond milk instead of cow's milk.  The cake was incredibly moist.  I was in a major hurry and had to frost the cake while it was still hot, so the frosting kind of melted but it was still good.  My family said it reminded them of maple bars.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
57256,94128,2007-07-13,4,"I like this cake ! It was VERY good, and easy to make. I think it tastes better on the 2nd day. My icing turned out a little stiff, I wish I had added a little milk to thin it out just a tad (my fault). My Dh loved it, THANKS for sharing !"
222076,94128,2007-09-02,5,"I didn't try the cake but 5 stars for the frosting. The butter-caramel mixture is heavenly and it can even be used without the powdered sugar for coffee or ice-cream. As frosting for cake, I think it's more compatible with chocolate cake rather than banana cake. The other reviews were right about the amount of powdered sugar - I only added 1 1/2 cups and I think I'll add even less the next time round. Yes there will definitely be a next time, thanks for posting!"
7802,94128,2007-10-04,5,"Ooops...I forgot to review this recipe. We made it for my grandson's 2nd birthday in July and everyone raved about it, even those skeptical chocolate cake lovers. Easy to make and very tasty. Thanks for posting..."
685988,94128,2008-02-06,5,"INCREDIBLE!  This cake is absolutely outstanding. I chose to make this for my b'day this year. We have 3 birthdays in less than 1 month, and I really didn't want another chocolate cake. I'm so pleased at how this turned out - so moist and yummy. I used butter instead of margarine and also added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the cake. The cake is fabulous as is - it really doesn't need the frosting but I made it anyway (needed only 2c. of powdered sugar) and it's so rich and buttery - it takes it to another level. I read that one reviewer didn't think that the frosting paired well with a banana cake even though they didn't try it and I have to say I completely disagree. It was a terrific pairing and was extremely popular with my family. This will be a cake I make often. Thank you!"
687512,94128,2008-03-16,3,"I liked the cake and I loved the frosting. But why give only 3 stars? Because I didn't like them together. The caramel frosing did not go well with banana cake. The banana flavor is quite strong in the cake and did not balance the caramel. My hubby's favorite frosting is caramel and he was very excited about this cake as I bake. He did not like it together at all, neither my kids. There is nothing wrong in the recipe, infact it is wonderful cake and frosting as I mentioned, but they just don't go well together. Sorry!"
327989,94128,2008-05-19,3,"I was debating between this and a chocolate banana cake and went ahead and combine the two.
To your basic recipe I added 2 cup of mashed in place of the 4 large ripe bananas, 3/4 c baking cocoa, and 1 T lemon juice. 
While it's a very heavy moist cake, it just didn't suit us. Next time I will be making this as written with no additions. I also made my own chocolate and pecan frosting which is too much. If you do add the cocoa, just serve with whipped topping. Otherwise it will be too heavy."
674208,94128,2008-06-02,5,So yummy and really easy to make.  My house smelled so good.  I thought the icing would be too rich for this hot June day so I opted for strawberry cool whip.  Perfect.  It passed the hubby test too.  He calls it my banana/strawberry cake.  Thanks!
157327,94128,2008-10-25,5,This was great!  I took it to work and everyone loved it.  The cake was very moist and the two flavors went well together.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks
888244,94128,2008-11-08,5,This was an awesome cake.  I made this for company last night and everyone gobbled it up.  My husband and father-in-law were hesitant about the frosting but after trying it the absolutely loved it.  I'll make a double batch next time so we have some leftovers :)  Thank you!
379985,94128,2008-11-24,5,This cake is sooo good. I served this for dessert tonight and we all  said this is a cake I will be making again.
215664,94128,2009-04-18,5,"This cake is wonderful!! The whole family agrees!!!

Just a quick update!!!  We put the leftover cake in the refrig and today it's even better cold!!!  Sooooo Yummy!!!!"
1001556,94128,2009-04-19,5,Made this cake last night for dessert.  It is WONDERFUL!!  The flavor combination of banana and caramel is perfect!  I only had three ripe bananas - can't imagine how it could be any better with four.  Probably used about 2 cups of powdered sugar -just kept adding until it reached the consistency I wanted.  Will definitely be a keeper at my house!
557764,94128,2009-04-21,5,"very good cake that can stand all by itself. However, the frosting makes it go over the top. Frost your cake once the cake is cooled and just as soon as the frosting is made, as mine got stiff very quick. One of my guests ate three pieces and exclaimed ""every bite is better than the one before"""
195589,94128,2009-07-15,5,"Had some black bananas and did not want to do banana bread yet again. Came across this recipe and SO glad that I did! I did use only 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting and used unsalted butter in both the cake and the frosting.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the cake mixture. I might try this with a cream cheese frosting next time. Thanks for posting, IamEarnie."
232933,94128,2009-10-09,5,"Addicting; addicting; addicting... needed a little more banana flavor (I added 1 teaspoon banana flavoring to the 4 bananas I used and it still needed a little more flavor...for that reason I give the cake 4 stars, instead of 5) BUT the Frosting I give 6 stars, so it averages out to 5 stars.
I changed the icing and brought the butter, brown sugar, and milk to a boil and immediately added 3 cups 10X sugar, beating it with a mixer until smooth...Make sure you sift the 10X sugar...I then poured the icing through a strainer as I iced the cake to get rid of any additional lumps of 10X sugar.  ""The icing is to die for!""  I am going to put it on some pumpkin cookies next.  Thanks, IamEarnie!"
931656,94128,2010-03-04,5,Yummy!  The cake was very moist.  Didn't use the frosting as I don't particularly care for caramel so I topped it with my cream cheese glaze... delicious!  Sprinkled walnuts over the whole thing.   My family loved it!  This recipe is a keeper.  Our bananas were extremely ripe so it was the perfect amount of banana flavor!  Thanks so much for posting this.
55655,94128,2010-06-30,5,"Oh my! I make a lot of cakes and cupcakes and this recipe is my new favourite! Right now, I am putting blobs of that divine caramel icing on still warm cupcakes! I had to use cream in both the cake and the frosting because that's all I had. I didn't use as much icing sugar as called for either - just until it felt right. Wonderful!"
1173385,94128,2010-07-19,5,"My husband and daughter demolished these. The frosting didn't turn out for me, but I will be attempting it again because everyone on here raved about it."
537188,94128,2010-08-18,5,This is a great banana cake - the caramel frosting really makes it stand out. Thanks!
1776821,94128,2010-12-27,4,"This was so very yummy and I got many compliments on it.  It also got eaten right away.  The icing is delicious and very easy to make.  I'm not sure what I expected ""banana cake"" to taste like but I thought it would be a little lighter in weight and texture more like a true cake.  I'm not sure if it depends on the number of bananas you put in but it really reminded me of a delicious banana bread-- heavier and denser than most cakes I bake.  I will definitely be make this one again.  Would be great with coffee."
1793155,94128,2011-04-03,5,"Wow! The icing is awesome! the cake really tastes and feels like banana bread. it turned out super moist and flavorful. Will definitely, definitely make this again! Husband loved it!"
1911882,94128,2011-08-12,5,Omg!!! soooooo delicious :) Ionly made the frosting I made it to frost a banana cake an boy was it good! so easy to make i will defiently be making this again!!!
740900,94128,2011-08-19,5,"These were absolutely wonderful.  I made a 3/4 recipe and it yielded 18 moist delicious cupcakes.  My children started devouring them before I could even make the icing.  The icing turned out like a caramel fudge on top which was perfect with the light fluffy moist banana cakes.  My mom inhaled two when she came for dinner.  I will quote my 3 1/2 year old who exclaimed ""This is delicious"" while stuffing his mouth.  The first time he used the word delicious.  I also gave six to my neighbours and they raved about them. Thanks so much.  This is definitely a keeper and will be in the lunch boxes in September!"
2006462,94128,2011-09-13,5,This cake was soooo good!  I invited my mother-in-law over who asked to take some home.  My husand ate two pieces.  My mother LOVED the frosting.  It was such a hit!  I will be making this again.  Thank you for sharing!
350750,94128,2012-07-29,5,"Yummy!  Made this for my son's 2nd birthday for a monkey themed party.  It went over well with the the birthday boy and guests.  Made 1 1/2 recipe to put in a sheet pan, I thought it came out great.  Thank you for the recipe!"
837304,94128,2012-10-06,2,"This rating is for the icing only:  the icing was way too sweet and almost no caramel flavor.  I stopped adding confectioner's sugar when it go to the right consistency (which was only about 2 and 1/2 cups), but it was still all that you can taste....sugar."
416684,94128,2012-12-29,5,"I have made this cake often, and usually with 3 bananas.  It is a lovely cake and the icing is to die for! Freezes well if you have any left!"
227367,94128,2016-10-09,5,"This is a great banana cake recipe! Nice, moist cake and super frosting. I have made it as written and also modified to be vegan for my vegan family members. To make it vegan, I substituted coconut oil for the butter/margarine, almond milk for the milk, and a flax seed meal egg substitute (for each egg; mix 1 tblsp flax meal and 3 tblsp water, let set 20 minutes, mix in a pinch of baking powder just before adding to the recipe). The vegan version was very well received by everyone."
763912,94128,2016-10-26,5,"This recipe was excellent. That being said--it was a great jumping off point. I knew, for our family that it had too much sugar. I decreased it by 1/c and then used half brown and half white. I added a tsp of cardamom, a Tbsp EACH of vanilla and banana extract. I always add a 1/8 of a tsp or so of organic xanthan gum to my baked goods. This ensures an excellent crumb. But no matter what I do, if the base recipe isn't good, mine doesn't come out. This was excellent , and mine was terrific. Thanks for a great recipe."
2001444588,94128,2017-04-29,3,"The cake was great! The icing turned out too sweet and hard. I think I got it too hard and added too much sugar even thoug I added less than the recipe called for. Gonna work on the icing and see if I can't get it right. It would help to have a temperature rather than a time as &quot;boil for two minutes&quot; is rather subjective. When dealing with candy, I have found the temperature to be very important."
2001741572,94128,2017-10-06,5,"I wanted something beside banana bread and gave this a try. This couldn't have been simpler...well it could have, in making the frosting I added the hot to my 3 cups of powdered sugar, instead of adding it a cup at a time. So I did not achieve the glossy frosting of the picture, but it did not change the taste of the cake."
288218,406723,2010-04-20,5,"Easy, tasty, refreshing and quick! What's not to love about it?
Made it for PAC Spring 2010.
Thanks!"
161745,85163,2005-03-14,5,"This happens to be one of my favorite appetizers, simple and tasty.  Instead of squeezing the garlic out  onto the bread, use a butter knife and you can scoop the clove right out of the garlic head, and spread it on the bread, then top with the Brie.  "
4470,85163,2008-03-23,5,One word - Heaven!  I combined this recipe with recipe#11165 - Simply heated the Brie.  What a wonderful combination.  Garlic lovers unit  Thanks  Helping Hands for posting this recipe
195589,85163,2009-03-29,5,"I have been  making this for years, I LOVE this stuff! I also heat up the Brie slightly in an oven-proof small dish. With a good sour dough bread, I can make a meal out of this! Thanks for posting, Helping Hands."
539686,290136,2008-03-13,4,"This is simple and delicious. I increased the maple syrup to 3 tablespoons and it was not too sweet. Made for photo tag, thanks for sharing."
58104,290136,2008-03-14,5,I Used steel cut oatmeal. This recipe ccan feed 6. Added the cinnamon before and after cooking. Top with additional milk at serving. I enjoyed this healthy chewy cereal. Using 2 tablespoon of maple syrup now brown sugar. Thanks!
601528,290136,2008-03-15,4,I used museli mix and upped the maple syrup to 3 tablespoons and it was delicious!
430471,290136,2008-03-24,5,"Boomie, this was perfect. I used quick oats and skim milk. Very yummy and great flavor without butter. Will make this again."
452940,290136,2008-04-07,4,I used steel cut oats and omitted the almonds. I also sprinkled some cinnamon on top before baking. This is a delicious way to prepare oatmeal. Thanks for posting it.
469903,290136,2008-04-17,5,"My hubby loves oatmeal, between bites he just kept saying 'This is good' over and over during dinner tonight.  DS and I also loved it!  None of us had ever had baked oatmeal before and what an easy dinner it made. I fried up some canadian bacon slices and made a low fat waldorf salad while it was in the oven. I removed from oven after 40 minutes and gave it a stir, then put it back in for another 5 minutes - I used a 1.5 qt round baking dish. DH already asked when we're having this one again. Made for PAC Spring 2008."
226066,290136,2008-04-22,4,My dbf loves oatmeal that he can bring to work with him - made this and he enjoyed it!  Added some dried cranberries to the mix!  Merci Boomette!
8688,290136,2008-05-04,5,"We just loved this!  I made exactly as directed, using old fashioned oats and I may have added a touch more brown sugar to the mix.  The flavor and texture was perfect! Thanks again, Boomette!"
422893,290136,2008-05-04,4,"I'm used to making microwave or stove-top porridge so this was something different for me. the texture is a lot firmer than I'm used to but this was lovely & tasty, I used Splenda instead of sugar & served alongside some vanilla yoghurt for a tasty brekky. Thanks Boomie!"
242766,290136,2008-05-08,5,"Delicious!  We really loved this quick and easy maple oatmeal.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13"" pan for 1 hour.  I didn't have any maple sugar, so I used dark brown sugar instead.  Also, I added some cinnamon and a little maple extract to the mixture before baking.  We loved the added crunch of the almonds.  I served this topped with brown sugar and milk.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!!"
278218,290136,2008-05-09,4,"Very delicious, light flavor. I used fake syrup (thought I had the real stuff, didn't), and soy milk (thought I had regular, didn't!) and sprinkled some nutmeg, cinnamon, and raisins on top as i put it in the oven. We all enjoyed the flavor. A nice way to do oatmeal, thanks!"
166642,290136,2008-05-17,5,"This is really delicious! I'm not a big fan of oatmeal, but this recipe makes me one. I love that it is baked and the flavors go together so well. Thanks for sharing!"
133174,290136,2008-05-26,4,"We eat oatmeal a couple of times a week and I really enjoy trying new ways of preparing it.  This made a very moist baked oatmeal that we enjoyed.  I used Splenda brown sugar for the brown sugar.  I did add a touch of maple flavoring along with low-fat milk.  Next time around, I may try this with pecans in place of the almonds.  Made for *Zaar Stars*"
679953,290136,2008-10-11,5,"A very good dish !!! The flavor was EXCELLENT, but the taste was EVEN BETTER !!  Easy to prepare, The only thing I did was I added a dash of brown sugar.  Made for Holiday tag."
424680,423471,2010-11-04,5,"Made this as a gift for a friend of mine ~ even sliced it for her, so managed to keep a couple of pieces for taste-testing! Loved the use of buttermilk here & I also used real butter & raisins (was generous with the latter)! Very nice tasting, & I now have a 2nd loaf in the oven just for the 2 of us here at home! Thanks for sharing this great recipe! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
141293,290136,2008-05-27,5,"This is a quick, delicious, easy breakfast. I made this Sunday afternoon in a texas muffin tin, just divided dry ingredients by 6 (except sugar). Mixed the liquid together with the sugar and poured 1/2 cup into each muffin hole. Made for 6 equal servings that I can put in individual containers and bring to work. Perfect way to make breakfast for the week and very filling too!"
171790,290136,2008-06-19,5,I cut this recipe to 1/3 since it was just for me. I kept all the proportions the same and followed the directions as written except for omitting the salt. I also used skim milk. This is delicious! Thanks for the great breakfast. Made for ZWT4
464080,290136,2008-06-20,5,"Outstanding.  I used my favorite Oven Toasted Oats from Trader Joes.  Cut recipe in half (and then I ate half) so to say this recipe serves 4 is probably fair.  Used brown sugar blend Splenda which turned out great.  Sprinkled on some cinnamon, nutmeg and coconut and I was good to go.  Made for ZWT4."
219318,290136,2008-06-23,5,"I love oatmeal, but who has time to stand around the stove in the morning?  This was perfect b/c I could mix it up, stick it in the oven, and get everyone ready to go while it cooked.  Made it exactly as written except for the almonds (nut allergies in the family).  It was a lovely texture, and I loved that it was just a touch sweet but not overwhelmingly so.  A keeper!"
324390,290136,2008-06-23,5,Oooh Yum! It was my first time making baked oatmeal and it certainly won't be my last! The maple syrup gave this a nice sweet flavor. I made an individual serving in an oven proof bowl along side your oatmeal cookie recipe! I used skim milk and added some dried cranberries. Made for ZWT 4 by a Jefe de la Cocina!
337963,290136,2008-06-24,4,"Loved it!  I don't like overly sweet oatmeal and I thought this one was just right.  I used 3/8 t kosher salt, added dried cranberries, and used walnuts rather than cranberries.  Perfect consistency, delicious topped with cream.  Thank you for posting Boomette!  Made for ZWT, please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
486725,290136,2008-06-26,5,"I have made a lot of baked oatmeals, but none with maple syrup, which really makes this recipe special! I also used walnuts and doubled them. I ended up tripling the maple syrup by accident (big heavy jug), but it really wasn't too sweet (and I don't like things very sweet). The major thing I did differently was to halve the milk and bake it for 30 minutes (I have made baked oatmeal with this high of liquid ratio before and it was very loose). Thanks for such a delicious breakfast, this will definitely be made again!"
590105,290136,2008-06-26,4,"This was good!  I'm rating the flavor because I didn't actually bake it.  I cut the recipe down for one and put 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1/2 cup Recipe #295198 in a bowl and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.  Then I added a wee dash of salt, 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup, and about a Tbsp sliced almonds.  Yummy!  Reviewed for ZWT4."
137050,290136,2008-06-28,5,"Made this yummy oatmeal for my grandaughter this morning. It took a bit longer to bake than what was posted, but the wait was worth it. I addded chopped pecans instead of almonds, and I served it with cimmanon and a bit more brown sugar on top. Very, very good. Next time, I will use a little less milk to cut the cooking time down a little. Thanks for posting this great recipe. Made for ZWT 4."
223854,290136,2008-06-29,5,Yum! I have never baked oatmeal before so this was a new experience.  The flavours were really good and we ate it like porridge for breakfast.  Even used the optional ground cinnamon. Thank you Boomette - *Made for Zaar World Tour 4*
431813,290136,2008-06-29,4,"Nice baked oatmeal.  We really liked the maple flavour.  Next time I would reduce the milk, as it formed a skin over the whole dish, which wasn't terribly appealing.  Thanks Boomette!  Made for ZWT 4."
385678,290136,2008-06-29,5,Yummy!  We loved this oatmeal!  We liked the added cinnamon.  My family enjoyed it with some vanila soy milk.  Thanks Boomette!  Made for ZWT4 - Jefes de la Cocina.
262423,290136,2008-08-02,4,This is good. Skipped the almonds (DS allergies) and used soy milk (same allergic child). Thanks for sharing. We'll definately make this again.
213139,290136,2008-08-10,5,"Made for ""I Recommend Recipe"" Tag.  Really easy oatmeal recipe.  It's great that you can put it in the oven and walk away - no standing at the stove watching it cook.  The other great thing is that it reheats really well.  Thanks Boomette for posting this recipe."
37449,290136,2008-08-18,4,"This was easy to make! I used almond milk, and maple sugar. Nice taste. I scaled the recipe down for one and used a individual casserole dish."
353394,290136,2008-10-31,4,This was very good and easy to make.  I made this for Sunday school class and it was quick to put together in the morning.  I like that this recipe has no eggs since my ds has an egg allergy.  I also left out the almonds (ds allergic). Thank you for a great recipe.
307214,290136,2008-11-22,5,"I made this for just myself.  After baking, I divided it into 6 pieces which made 6 breakfasts for me.  I heated it in the microwave, added milk and either raisins or chopped pear.  A great breakfast for people on the go."
37636,290136,2008-12-17,5,"Wonderful! Nice, hot and creamy with the crunch of nuts and just the right amount of maple (not too overpowering). Perfect as is, or also perfect with raisins added, which is how my husband likes it. Thanks for sharing! ~Sue"
506337,290136,2009-06-09,5,"This is a terrific recipe. I`ve just made it and put half away for midnight snacks (warmed up in microwave with spot of milk).
Only one thing. Although I`ve got a very sweet tooth I still found it was a bit too sweet so next time I`ll only put the maple syrup and omit any sugar.
This is a real find!"
498271,290136,2009-07-03,5,"Great oatmeal recipe!  I halved the recipe and left out the almonds, otherwise made just as directed.  It's perfectly sweetened as it is - served topped with a little milk and it was a terrific breakfast - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
461834,290136,2009-07-05,5,Made this to serve 1 and it worked out great!!  I love almonds but think I would leave them out next time!!  This would be great to do on the weekend as you could get up and mix it all up and put in the oven while you have time to shower and get ready while it bakes!!  After baking I served it with a splash of milk.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for holiday tag.
542159,290136,2009-08-31,5,Very yummy. Cut down to serve two and baked in custard cups.  Made with steel cut oats it came out thick and chew which is just the way we like. Thanks for the post.
341170,290136,2009-11-27,5,I cut it down to serve 2 and baked it in ramekin dishes. I used a little less milk than called for since we like more firm oatmeal. I skipped on the almonds but added the cinnamon. Much loved all around!
1320105,290136,2010-01-08,2,"This is not the typical baked oatmeal that my family is use to.  Only 1 child liked this and the others just played around with it until the school bus came.  I wish I could have rated this higher since it has many rave reviews, but for my family, it did not go well.  Thanks anyway."
1049724,290136,2010-05-08,3,Didn't quite do it for me for the 40 minutes or so it took.  I normally make oatmeal with butter and brown sugar - 5 minutes.  Sorry
315565,290136,2010-08-23,5,"Wonderful result for me here ! Really it  makes several breakfasts in one hit so very convenient. I mixed diced cooked pear through it and it all baked up well together.So now for brekky I take my serve , heat in the m/wave and add yoghurt and breakfast is done - just perfect !"
386849,290136,2011-01-04,5,Wonderful oatmeal.  Different than the typical baked oatmeal as it doesnt have any eggs or leavening agent.  It was slightly slicky and just sweet enough.  Way easy to make.  Will definitely keep this recipe around for a nice change of pace from the usual baked oatmeal.  Thank you so much for posting.
369715,290136,2012-02-29,5,I didn't use the almonds as I didn't have any and I used Splenda brown sugar blend so only used a tablespoon. I didn't add any salt. I loved it hot out the oven. I ate it cold in the morning the next day and liked it like that too. I did heat it in the microwave in the morning for my son and it dried out a bit but we just added a touch of milk and we were good to go. I really enjoyed the taste of this as it wasn't too sweet. I was worried about the amount a milk and probably would cut it back just a bit next time. I cooked mine for 40 minutes and I agree with the other reviewer that the milk that skimmed on the sides didn't look too appetizing. I just took a knife and mixed it up a bit before anyone else noticed.
1175362,290136,2013-02-27,5,Loved it!  Made it just as written.  The milk makes it so creamy and rich and the maple syrup is just the right amount (not too strong).  The almonds were delicious in it.  I really enjoyed the dusting of cinnamon on top that you suggested . My husband raved about it. So easy too.  Thanks.
736247,290136,2014-08-26,5,"Very tasty and creamy, exactly what I wanted! The almonds add a bit of crunch and I will probably add some fruit to it as some suggested in the comments. I am sure it would still be divine! I didn&#039;t get any ugly burnt milk on the sides of the casserole after the 40 min in 350F, so it was good. The only thing is that I found the leftover I had for breakfast this morning was some dry after heating up in the microwave, even after adding a bit of milk, so next time I&#039;ll probably make 1/2 the recipe as I am the only one eating oatmeal here. Thanks for posting!"
400708,290136,2014-09-30,5,"It gets so crazy during the holidays that we often don&#039;t eat the way we should.  This was a wonderful warm breakfast for us and I love having the left overs to heat up when we are in a hurry.  I made this exactly as directed and wouldn&#039;t change a thing.  Just sweet enough and went together so easy.  The baking time gave me those extra few minutes in the morning to get organized and was then ready to pull out of the oven just in time for breakfast with hot coffee.  DH added a splash of milk to his, but not me - I loved it just as made hot from the oven.  Now I&#039;ve got enough left over for 2 more meals with no more prep than popping in the microwave.  What a great idea and no wonder you&#039;ve had all these great reviews.  I think next time I&#039;ll try it with steel oats for that chewy factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update 10-16-2011  I&#039;ve made this many times now and enjoy it each and every one - but I&#039;m now using steel oats and find that I really enjoy the difference it makes.  One of my favorite cool weather breakfasts.  Continue to use this at this time of year, so good"
34122,290136,2015-11-14,5,Five stars for ease of preparation and deliciousness.  I didn&#039;t have nuts but did have an apple so I grated that and squeezed out as much moisture as I could.  We both loved it.
2000498330,290136,2018-10-14,5,An easy way to get your morning bowl of oats. Creamy and perfect texture. Used Splenda brown sugar and added a little more because I like mine sweeter.
37449,452173,2011-05-16,5,I used vegetable broth and really enjoyed this recipe! The onions got a nice glaze. Made for Newest Zaar Tag.
39835,172102,2007-05-26,5,These are wonderful with vanilla ice cream as suggested but I think they will work with low fat yogurt too! I figured for WW they are only 3 points per serving!!! Thanks for sharing this keeper!
199213,172102,2007-05-28,5,"Made for ZWT#3, nice healthy dessert without Ice Cream."
68960,172102,2007-05-29,5,"Wow, these are great.  I didn't have fresh apricots on hand so instead used a large tin of apricot halves. The almonds really made this recipe. They toasted up nicely and added a delightful crunch.  Served with vanilla ice cream and was enjoyed by all the family. Thanks Kim!"
80353,172102,2007-05-30,5,I got some lovely fresh apricots at the market and used them for this recipe.  So easy to make and really scrumptious.  I negged on the icecream to enjoy this 'on the lighter side' and didn't miss it a bit!
67656,172102,2007-06-05,4,"Simple, easy and tasty. These would work especially well if you are serving a complicated dinner and want a simple but elegant dessert - both in terms of flavors and time.  I especially liked the flavor combination of the silky apricots with the crunchy nuts. I served mine with a small scoop of vanilla non-fat yogurt. (Would make a terrific breakfast.) My one suggestion was that in making my dessert a good amount of the honey melted to the botom of the baking dish.  While a small amount of the honey created a golden syrup, most turned into a hard and bitter shell. The next time I make this I might add the honey half way through the cooking time to resolve this."
382999,172102,2007-06-25,4,"I loved it!  I love apricots and honey, so naturally, I loved this.  It was no trouble to make.  I served it with ice cream, but it could be served with a frozen yogurt or frozen whipped cheese, and still be a delicious dessert that combined warm honeyed fruits with a frozen dessert."
223979,172102,2007-06-28,4,This is a really nice dessert.  I used apricots from our tree and served this over homemade vanilla ice cream that my daughter made.  Yum!!!
102058,172102,2007-07-03,4,"Mummmmmm, lovely ! this tastes great. I have slivered almonds and turned the baking cupboard upside down looking for them, with no success so blitzed some whole almonds used them instead. Great combination of flavours, I would use more honey though. I accidently left mine in the oven for 20 minutes and they came out soft and georgous, a lovely balance of squishy cooked apricots and crunchy nuts... and the aroma of almond ... glorious. Please see my rating system a wonderful 4 stars for an easy and delish dessert. Thanks!"
394085,172102,2007-07-15,5,Wonderful...without ice cream. Tart and sweet and unctuous and crunchy. And sooooooo easy! My highest compliments!
337963,172102,2008-04-28,2,"Kim, I'm so sorry but this recipe just didn't suit our tastes.  We love apricots, almonds and honey, so I thought we would enjoy the dish.  Somehow the flavor combination just didn't suit us.  Thanks for posting Kim.  Made for Potluck, please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
464080,172102,2009-07-10,5,"If you like apricots, then you'll love this recipe.  Mine were cooked perfectly in 10 minutes.  I did use Agave in place of honey, but made them as written otherwise.  Served them for breakfast, drizzled with some vanilla yogurt.  Very nice.  THANKS Kim!!!  Recipenapped for Veg*n Tag July 2009."
67728,172102,2011-06-04,5,"Found some lovely apricots at the store and decided to try this -- glad I did! I made a half-recipe because I was the only one home. I didn't have any slivered almonds, so I chopped up a few whole almonds instead. I drizzled some extra honey over them after they baked, too. I sprinkled them with a little too much ginger, so they were a bit zingy, but that was my own fault. I didn't have any apricot-friendly ice cream in the house, so I just ate them as-is. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe on hand for apricot season, thanks for posting! Made for the Emerald City Shakers for ZWT7"
498271,509739,2013-12-27,5,"This is a great tasty cheeseball!  I didn&#039;t want the broccoli to be raw so I sauteed it just a bit with the bacon before adding it to the cheese.  I also took your suggestion and mixed the bacon in with the cheese, then rolled the mixture in chopped parsley before serving.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
13593,29483,2009-06-14,5,"I used this on chicken and it yielded a very flavorful, tender chicken breast.  I am looking forward to the leftovers.  Thanks Luke"
804550,367885,2009-08-03,5,"Although I'm not Jewish I do go to my in-laws' Seder every Passover and partake in their traditional foods, so when I saw this recipe I was overjoyed! I love Charoset and it never occurred to me to look up the recipe on Zaar. I halved the recipe except for the wine and the cinnamon. I also used cream sherry as my red wine. This recipe is spot on and delicious! Of course I didn't have any romaine lettuce or matzo in the house, however I will pick some up later when I go out! Thanks for posting!
Made for Photo Tag 2009."
197023,129604,2005-09-09,4,"This recipe lived up to Whisper’s promise that it was quick to make, so it’s a great recipe for times – and isn’t that just TOO MUCH of the time – when we just don’t have much time!  I was a bit concerned the potato and onion might stick to the foil, so I brushed a little bit of olive oil on each piece of foil, and sprinkled the potatoes with some garlic salt and dried oregano.  Then left them unattended to bake!  They were delicious.  A great accompaniment to so many other dishes, particularly ones which are demanding on time, but I do think they did need the addition of herbs.  Thanks, Whisper, for a great recipe that I’ll certainly experiment with some more."
429892,78220,2008-03-01,5,I didn't know how to cook fresh aspargus.  I used a little olive oil  with a smaller amount of butter on top. I thought it was very simple and tasted wonderful.
182809,348276,2009-03-12,5,5 stars all the way!  Thanks for posting this as it was a nice change for using spinach. The only change I made was to add one level tsp. of ground cumin to the mix. Never needed to use salt....which is a good thing IMHO.
220348,348276,2009-01-12,5,"Wow, spinach and peanut butter go well together! I used canned tomatoes, because I wanted a much more hearty soup. I may have used a little more than 4 tablespoons of peanut butter, but that was a good thing."
1159192,348276,2009-02-07,5,I was looking for something a little different and this really hit the spot. It was excellent!  Very nutritious too. I did go a little heavy on the peanut butter. Beats a PB+J any day.
542159,348276,2009-04-06,5,"Supper healthy, quick, and great served over garlic flavored polenta. Did add just a little black pepper."
1247181,348276,2009-06-23,5,I love this dish!  I also found it first on the downunder website but then lost it and needed it again and found it here (thank you!).  I use canned tomatoes and serve it over quinoa.  It is SO good - I always want to eat a ton of it!!
256795,348276,2009-12-30,5,"Delicious!!  And so easy!!  I used frozen home-grown tomatoes in this, and it was fabulous.  Thanks so much for sharing!  :O)"
267241,348276,2010-01-04,5,"This was very good, especially for such a healthy meal. I used almond butter as a healthier option to peanut butter and served over polenta, which worked well. Next time I think I'll add a little something else, maybe almonds/peanuts/seeds for some texture.
Thanks for posting!"
599450,348276,2010-01-19,5,"I find this dish to have interest, great nutrition, and some versatility as Karen Elizabeth and other reviewers suggests. I made as directed with canned tomatoes (mostly a time issue as I'm quite adept at peeling tomatoes :)) and a 16 ounce bag of frozen chopped spinach which I drained well beforehand. When I saw the price at the grocer for 2 pounds of fresh spinach I choked! I went back home and re-reviewed the recipe and thought that not only would frozen work for the recipe - it does - it also works for my budget! Caution: this is not a pretty dish; when I went to take a picture of it (I'm the 8th reviewer and no one else had submitted a photo - my first clue as to whether or not this dish is photogenic!) I literally threw on some peanuts to give it that <i>J'nes se qua</i>. Thanks, Karen Elizabeth, for a great and simple twist on spinach that goes well with Indian cuisine! Made for NAME tag game."
451456,348276,2010-02-26,5,"This is a very delicious way to get some iron in your diet and EASY to make!  I stole mersaydees's idea of using frozen spinach (but I didn't even bother to thaw or drain it.  I just cooked it a little longer.) and also used canned tomatoes.  I added some crushed red pepper and garlic powder at the end and also threw some crushed peanuts on top before serving.  On the first night I served it over quinoa.  The next day we had it over baked polenta.  It was delicious both times.  I will definitely make this again since my husband also loved it!  Reviewed for Veggie Swap, February 2010."
1458294,348276,2010-03-04,4,This was amazing! I used crunchy peanut butter and served the stew with tortillas. Definitely a keeper
512834,348276,2010-05-21,5,"My partner didn't like this, but I loved it! I made it with half spinach and half swiss chard, some white beans, and lots of chile pepper. I served it over millet - delicious!"
1102522,348276,2010-07-20,5,"Loved this!  <br/><br/>I added minced garlic and red pepper flakes while cooking, and topped with chopped peanuts and Thai chili peppers before serving. I bet it works well over pasta too!"
2185662,348276,2012-06-24,5,"Wonderful!  I've only made it with canned tomatoes, but look forward to using fresh when they ripen.  Store tomatoes never have any flavor,  Next time I'm going to use frozen spinach also."
542159,375314,2009-10-02,4,Tasty. Enjoyed that these had a healthy stuffing. Made with pecans as when I reached for the hazelnuts DH had eaten them errrr :(  My apples may have been big then what the recipe called for as the described filling only made enough for two apples. The cook time was also off at the end of 15 minutes the apples were so hard could not stick with a fork so cooked an additional 15 minutes to get them soft. The taste was good and would be best served with ice cream as suggested in the description.
52282,61182,2003-05-10,5,"i made this tonight and my guests couldn't stop raving, my dh kept saying this was the best thing ever, kids loved it, and guests all took home copies of the recipe= what more can i say???? except...
i didn't know what dream whip was, and then i couldn't find it so- i whipped 1 c of heavy cream with my electric mixer. then added 2 tbsp confectioners sugar and 1 tsp vanilla- it made a nice light whipped cream topping
i refrigerated it for a few hours and it was just wonderful.
thanks laurie"
211329,122497,2005-05-21,5,i wanted to let you know my children really enjoyed this and i also found myself sipping it again and again and i am not one for grape juice.  it just really had a nice taste to it.  thanks!
185105,122497,2005-09-29,5,"Oh!  We love this so much!!!  It's that ""special treat"" that I give my kids when they've been good!!!  Just like my Mom used to do for me....Great incentive for ""being good"" in my book!!!  YUM!  :)"
33747,61114,2003-05-05,4,"OOPs my mistake on first comment, my bad. What I wanted to say was  when I saw the combination of the ingredients with potatoes, I thought to my self wow! that sounds good and a different way to make potatoes. The only thing I will do is cut the oil in 1/2 and microwave the cut up potatoes for a soft center and then cook with onions til nice and crispy. Oh yeah!!! looks like this is my side dish for dinner tonight. Thanks!!
;-)"
400817,61114,2007-02-21,5,"I had to use canned chopped tomatoes (2 - 14 oz cans), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and this was WONDERFUL! I served it with some pork chops that were a little on the sweet side, and these spicy potatoes were the perfect compliment."
199848,61114,2009-02-19,5,Awesome potatoes! The spices are just right. I cut some fat and calories by using only 1/8 cup of (olive) oil and made up the other 1/8 cup with water. It worked wonderfully. I garnished with chopped cilantro leaves.  Thanx for sharing this potato dish!
257341,61114,2009-03-12,5,"awesome!
i actually add chopped chicken that i fry on the side and serve it over quinoa prepared in chicken stock with cilantro. i also garnish this with cilantro and a touch of yogurt sauce.
SUPER YUM!!!"
186802,122344,2005-05-18,5,It was a delicious change to the conventional meatloaf.  The tangy onion topping was a yummy addition.  Thanks Heather for the great dinner recipe.  I am keeping this one on file!
91392,122344,2007-03-25,5,"I saw this and had to make it.  It is much better than a typical meatloaf.  The pork beef combo is a good idea and the BBQ sauce and onions give it a lot more interest.  Anyone would like this and it was fast, easy and economical to make too."
8629,122344,2008-06-05,4,The tangy topping really makes this a special meat loaf recipe.  I really liked it with the meat loaf.
43083,122344,2008-10-12,3,I couldnt make the topping because I only had one onion so my review is for the meatloaf only. It didnt have alot of grease which was nice but it was also a bit dry. I did serve it with BBQ sauce which helped alot. My 6 yr old really enjoyed it. Thanks for an easy meatloaf recipe!
424008,122344,2009-07-07,5,"This is a very awesome meatloaf recipe :)
Thanks for posting"
54697,94739,2006-08-24,5,These are great.  I also amde them with roquefort and walnuts and that's a nice combination too.  
183417,94739,2004-12-28,5,"These are divine. I also saw these on Queer Eye and was glad to find the recipe. I made these for a Christmas Eve party and won a ""Most Martha Stewart-ish"" award. 

The combination of ingredients at first seems strange, but together they form complex taste layers that are delicious. The salty bacon is countered by the sweetness of the dates and the creaminess of the goat cheese. The almond adds a nice crunch to an other wise ""soft"" mouthful.

I did not present this on the pineapple, but they were delicious anyway. For novice chefs or people with a brain phase at the time of baking; make sure to bake these on a pan with SIDES. Otherwise you will have an oven fire from the bacon grease.

Also, if you don't have a pastry bag, just slice the dates lengthwise to stuff with a spoon. The bacon hides the slice.

These are easy to make and wonderful to eat. ENJOY!!"
150464,94739,2005-12-28,5,"One of my friends makes these for every potluck that we have.  I can't get enough of them!  I absolutely LOVE them!  The combination of the sweet, salty, smoky, creamy is just divine.   I'm making these for New Year's Eve and hoping that I get a few :)

"
569266,94739,2007-11-07,5,these are outrageously good!! :)
461834,294439,2009-02-04,4,"Such a simple sauce to prepare and with things I normally have on hand.  I used it to baste skinless chicken thighs.  I loved the strong flavor of the lemon juice but for my tastes, the worcestershire sauce was too much and felt it needed some more seasoning such as garlic or onion.  Would make again with some tweaking for my own tastes.  Thanks for sharing Jackie!!  Made for your win in Potluck Tag."
422893,190934,2007-08-29,4,"These were very easy to whip up & tasted good too. I only had about 1 cups worth of apricots and subbed Splenda for the sugar. I did them as mini cupcakes instead of in ramekins and got about 12 cupcakes & 9 bite-size cakes. These will be great for my DD's playgroup, thanks!"
1271905,94739,2009-05-18,5,These are so easy and so addictive!  I'll buy a carton of Medjool dates and make myself a few every day after work as an appetizer until they're all gone.  :)
1489336,94739,2009-12-19,5,"I personally love dates and goat cheese, but I wasn't sure how they would be received because I know those are not universally appreciated.  People were coming up to me all night asking for the recipe, and they were gone before almost anything else!  There was some confusion with some people because they mistook the almond for a pit.  Next time I may put a card next to the tray explaining they have an almond inside."
1070901,94739,2011-12-07,5,"Delicious! I left out the almonds, and made them in my toaster oven (it only goes to 450, so took longer - maybe about 15m). They were wonderful! My boyfriend told me I'd set a new bar."
857671,94739,2012-05-15,5,"Loved these!!  Made them for an office party and they were eaten up very quickly.  Left the goat cheese out of half of them just in case people didn't like goat cheese, but both methods were very popular.  The goat cheese adds a nice, creamy texture to the whole thing.  Next time I would pre-cook the bacon just slightly, though, because I had a hard time telling if it was cooked all the way through!"
257154,94739,2013-01-04,5,"Really delicious and so fast/easy to prepare and can be done in advance. One tip: to prepare for serving, don't do what I did and look at just the cooking time to gauge when they will be ready - heating an oven to 500 can take a LONG time, so remember to factor that in! Another thing, I used fairly large dates and ended up adding more goat cheese than necessary, so next time I'll use smaller dates for more balance of the flavors. Still tasty, though. The only downside: not the most attractive appetizer, so a little bit of a 'hard sell' visually until people taste them and word spreads - then they disappear!"
1383313,94739,2014-12-26,5,"Worried about the bacon (some reviews said it was hard to get it to be fully cooked) I used pancetta instead.  Wow!  I stuffed them a day ahead, using a cranberry goat cheese and smoked almonds, wrapping the thin pancetta and securing each with a toothpick.  They came out of the oven just perfect! I then drizzled a bit of chocolate balsamic over the tops.  These are great to eat while warm, but they sit well too and are just as delicious!"
560491,437455,2011-10-16,5,"Very good and fall-like.  I would decrease the cloves by half (personal preference) but otherwise it was great.  Pork came out tender and the veggies were perfectly cooked, not mushy at all.  Made for PAC Fall 2011."
184530,33141,2007-12-04,0,"This made a very tasty and satisfying lunch. I used  oat and honey loaf and sweet gherkins so my sandwich was quite sweet, and I used extra sharp cheese, frying the complete sandwich in little organic butter in a pan on the stove top.  Next time I'll either use white bread (so the sandwich crisps) or hamburgers buns as per the recipe, and will post a rating.  Thanks!"
114995,437455,2012-10-23,0,"We really liked this. I didn't have any dry mustard, so I drizzled  a little prepared mustard over the top of the mixture before I started cooking it. My only negative comment is that it took me much longer than 10 minutes to prepare.  But it was well worth the extra time at that point when all I had to do was spoon it onto plates at dinner time.  Thanks for posting."
383346,437455,2012-12-08,3,I really thought we would like this pork stew.  But it was not a success.  The veggies had a great taste.  But the pork was dry even though I cut large cubes and I cooked it 6 hours at low.  Thanks landlocked for posting this recipe.  Made for cookbook tag game
1800290124,437455,2013-12-13,0,made this for dinner last night. it was a little bland maybe because dh can not stand cloves so i left them out will try adding more garlic and maybe a sprinkle of ginger for a little kick next time i make it. i have a old round crock pot and it did not hold all the ingredients i guess i will be investing in a new oval one soon. thanks for posting this recipe we enjoyed it with some honey corn muffins.
1107936,437455,2015-05-31,2,"Sorry to say that this was just alright.  I don&#039;t know if it was just my veggies, but they tasted bland, as if they didn&#039;t soak up any of the flavor, and the rest tasted really odd.  The pork just sat on top and didn&#039;t get any of the juice, as instructed in the recipe, so it predictably came out dry."
29196,42515,2002-10-10,5,"This wonderful sauce is simple enough for everyday meals, but elegant enough to serve to visitors. It has a sweet/sour , buttery flavour that goes well with steak (we had rump). If you make it before your steak is cooked and let it sit, it splits, but comes back together easily with a re-heat and a quick whisk."
20477,42515,2003-02-17,5,"This was fantastic.  Made it for our dinner of filet mignonne, and we were amazed at the wonderful taste.  Definitely agree with Jan, nice ( and easy!! ) enough for us to make it for everyday type stuff as well as for guests.  Fantastic."
89617,42515,2003-06-12,0,it was awesome id usedsomething similar  on peppered yellow fin tuna in the past but with steak the steak juices mixing with vinegar reduction and then iput chopped tomatos with just salt and pepperon top it really worked well people loved it
158087,42515,2005-11-08,3,"I made this for NY strip steaks.  It was just too sweet for me; but I may try it again, omiting the sugar. "
135566,42515,2009-04-11,5,"I normally do not eat anything on my steak -- I love it cooked medium-rare with no distractions from the beef flavor. However, I do love balsamic vinegar and this recipe piqued my interest. We grilled T-bones on the barbecue and this sauce was awesome with the grilled smokiness of the meat and when mixed with the meat juices, WOW. Made for Spring 2009 Pick A Chef."
512309,158382,2008-04-20,4,"I made this for our seder this year, intrigued by the cherries.  I love the cherry-almond combination.
This is a delicious charoset, but in my opinion the cherries got lost.  I mostly tasted apples and cinnamon, which was fine, but I didn't get the cherry-almond flavor as predominant.  I used jarred dark sweet cherries that were in light syrup, and I used the cherry liquid in place of sweet wine.  I used Gala apples.
The next time I make this (for tonight's seder, perhaps?) I will use only one apple, and will add in at least 1/2 cup of dried sour cherries, and will add more liquid from the cherry jar if needed to balance the dried sour cherries.  For those who are making this outside of Passover, I could see adding a few drops of almond extract to boost the almond flavor, too.
Thanks, Oolala, and Chag Sameah!"
482422,158382,2008-04-21,4,"I used frozen cherries for this recipe, and a little less honey.  Didn't think the almond flavor came through, but everyone enjoyed it.  Something just a little different."
321371,158382,2008-04-21,5,This was wonderful...I added a little more cinnamon and almonds.  I will be making this again.
2176587,158382,2015-04-03,5,"This chraroset is 5-star worthy! I tasted it immediately after making it and it was scrumptious. Now I am marinating it in the refrigerator today and will serve it tomorrow at Passover dinner. After a day of marinating, I&#039;m sure the flavor will be even more amazing. I used tart red cherries in the recipe and reserved some whole ones to garnish the top of the Charoset...it looks beautiful. I did not use wine for moisture...I used a tablespoon of the cherry water reserved from my can of red tart cherries and an extra tablespoon of pure vanilla extract and this worked very well. Thank you, for sharing this wonderful recipe."
869184,439791,2013-02-18,5,I took the basics of this recipe and cooked the mushrooms in a bit different way. I chopped them up finely and roasted with the herbs and butter (not oil) in a pan and served over baquette slices. The flavours were just yummy.
865936,499406,2013-10-24,4,I especially liked the nuts and the celery in this salad.
39835,57419,2003-05-30,5,"This is the best banana bread we've had in a very long time. We had this for breakfast and it was gone in no time. The only changes I made was that I didn't have any buttermilk so I used sour milk instead, I also used one cup of raisins instead of nuts and I used both whole wheat and white flour. Even with my subsitutions this was great for breakfast. Thanks kcdelong for posting this delicious banana bread recipe."
1535,57419,2005-02-10,5,"This banana bread is FULL of flavor and extremely moist. It is absolutely perfect and there isn't a single thing that needs to be changed or added. If you are looking for a good, basic, unadultrated banana bread recipe, this is it! "
245340,57419,2005-12-15,5,I made this for Christmas and didn't change a thing.  It is the best banana bread I have ever tasted.  Very moist and flavorful.  Thank you for a great recipe!
250238,57419,2006-03-30,5,I intentionally buy too many bananas in order to have enough to make this bread.  Co-workers and family all request it regularly.  I use previously frozen mushy bananas and it turns out a bread that tastes gourmet.  Love it. 
225114,57419,2006-04-14,4,"The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is that it rec'd mixed reviews from my household.  Even though he liked this, my husband prefers the more bread-y texture of my regular recipe.  But I absolutely love this recipe so much more!  It is so moist, and very flavorful, the banana taste is excellent.  I thought it was going to be too sweet, and it probably could use a little less sugar if you are looking to cut down, but it was very good as is."
503618,57419,2007-07-25,3,"This banana bread had a really great flavour with the added buttermilk, I love the idea. My b/f absolutely loved it, but I would have liked it better if it was a little less sweet. It was likely my fault for being over sweet because I added a handful of chocolate chips instead of nuts. I think I would prefer doing half brown sugar and half white next time. I'll give it a try because I will definitely be making this again. It took an extra half hour to bake than the time given. It turned out fantastically moist. Thanks for the recipe!!"
715206,57419,2008-01-04,4,"I used whole wheat flour, demerara sugar & added 2 tbls flax seed meal & 1 tbls chai spice blend seasoning, and it is excellent! Next time I will try allspice, but you can take this already excellent recipe & bend it in many directions."
64583,61171,2003-05-07,5,"Wow!  These are great!  I don't have a 9x9 pan, so I used an 8x8 pan and it turned out fine.  It reminds me of apple crisp but better. I only had to bake mine for 35 minutes and it was nice and golden brown and the apples were tender. I only wished I had vanilla ice cream to go with it!  Thanks for a great recipe. "
102602,61171,2003-10-11,5,"This is really good. Cornelia, you're right... apples and oatmeal do go well together. I substituted one cup whole wheat flour for a cup of regular flour. I also added a little cardomom to the apples. Next time I'll add some more apples to the recipe. This one's a keeper, thanks Cornelia!"
100608,61171,2004-10-04,5,Extremely good. We both loved it as it reminds us of an apple pie. My wife used Winesap apples from our farmers market and it was great.
128693,61171,2005-04-26,5,I made these using quick oats and reconstituted dried apple slices and it was still great! All the kids really enjoyed this. I can't wait to try it using fresh apples.
13029,61171,2005-09-26,5,"I needed a last-minute recipe for my 2nd grade DD 'Apple Day' at school. This was super-easy and quite delicious. I used Gala apples, which worked fine, but I'll use Granny Smith next time so the bars are more tart. Used a 11 x 7 pan and that worked out great. It made about 20 small to medium bars. Wish I could've eaten one right out of the oven!
"
56463,61171,2006-03-20,5,"Very nice recipe. We really enjoyed it. Thanks, Carole in Orlando"
323249,61171,2006-07-23,5,My family loved these bars. I added some chopped pecans on the top to give it a little extra crunch. Thanks for posting!
129652,61171,2006-07-23,4,"I brought these to church for breakfast.  They went over well.  I doubled the recipe and put everything into a 13x9-inch pan.  I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes.  I also drizzled melted white chocolate on top after it cooled.  Next time (and I will make this again) I'm reducing the amount of margarine and sugar added to the apples by at least half.  I also added apple pie spice, which was good."
93985,61171,2006-10-16,4,Everyone loved these!  I will definately make again.  Next time I'm going to reduce the amount of sugar on the apples. Thanks for sharing.
180879,61171,2007-03-12,5,I just made this again. 2nd time in 1 week. Everyone loves it! It was all gone in 1 evening and everyone wanted more. Hubby says this is perfect with ice cream. Almost better than pie. Perfect.
565276,61171,2007-10-10,4,"I loved these!  I used braburn apples, quick oats, and added a bit of nutmeg and cloves, and upped the cinnamon.  They were a little thick.  Next time I'll try making them in something a little larger than a 9x9.  But I served it warm with vanilla ice cream, and YUM!"
119956,61171,2007-12-10,5,I had a couple of apples that were getting past their prime and used them in this recipe. It was so easy and very good. Thanks.
230102,61171,2008-06-29,5,"Wow -- I'm the 13th reviewer!  Has to be an omen!  This is a delicious little bar cookie!  I used butter in place of margarine, but other than that, followed the directions exactly.  It intrigued me that some reviewers were going to reduce the sugar in the apples.  I thought they could be a little sweeter.  I may try them with dried apples as Kzim4 did.  You don't think they are going to cut nicely, but they do!  I cut mine while they were still warm, and they came out perfectly!  Lainie, thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I will be making these again!"
672616,61171,2008-09-29,5,"I baked this in an 8x8 pan for 1 hour and topped it with 1/2 cup pecams. I placed tin foil lightly over the top to keep the pecans from burning. Mine was a little crumbly so I'm looking at increasing the butter to 1 cup. Also, like another reviewer, I'll try a bigger pan to get them thinner. I also upped the cinnamon to 1t and added 1/2 t nutmed and 1/4t cloves. My BF was hit with the scent when he can home and said it was great. For me, more of a crumble than a bar. You have to let this sit overnight to be able to cut  it but still a fabulous recipe."
626447,61171,2008-11-25,5,"These were enjoyed tremendously at work, and I got lots of great comments from all who indulged in the break room!  I am going to make them again for Thanksgiving, as I know everyone will love them!"
1522577,61171,2010-05-16,5,"I made these tonight and I loved them! I cut them into bars and wrapped them individually to place in the freezer. They will make a great, quick snack!"
88243,61171,2011-09-14,5,sooo yummy! I used 100% whole wheat flour and substituted smart balance for the butter. I would definitely use more apples next time (I used 3 cups - 4 medium apples)
383346,61171,2011-12-13,5,"The taste is so good.  I used butter instead of margarine.  The butter was room temperature.  I had problems with the oatmeal mixture.  Probably because of the butter.  I couldn't cut cute squares for a photo.  It's too crumbly.  I don't know if the butter should have been melted when added to the oatmeal and flour mixture.  Maybe it would have help.  But the taste is so good.  In the apples, I used splenda.  Thanks LainieBug :)  Made for your win in Bargain Basement tag game"
1094446,61171,2012-07-26,5,"Oh my God, these are delicious!  With the modifications I made based on others' reviews, they were not overly sweet with a soft, moist bottom and a crispy top layer.  Unlike others, however, I found that the amount of oatmeal batter was quite scant for my 9x9 pan... not sure why.  I had enough batter to press a thin layer onto the bottom of the pan (which took more than half of it), and I had to kind of crumble the remaining onto the top to try to cover everything as evenly as possible before gently pressing it to spread it out a bit.  Next time I will either multiply the batter recipe by 1.5 or use a smaller pan.  My changes: 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, half dairy- and soy-free margarine and half applesauce (to make 3/4 cup), 1 tsp cinnamon, a scant cup of brown sugar and about 3 cups of sliced golden delicious apples.  I will absolutely make these again soon!"
1538453,61171,2012-09-20,5,These were great! Made exactly as recipe states except I used gluten free flour in place of the regular flour. My family ate them almost immediately. Will be making these again tonight. :) Thank you for the great recipe!
482933,61171,2012-10-03,5,Oh my this is so good that I have made it twice and will definitely make it many more times!  Was picking up the crumbs from the counter. Love oatmeal in desserts which for me is part of the charm- top and bottom layers of a perfect streusel.  Both times I used four Granny Smiths and increased cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  First time I used the half cup sugar for filling and felt that it was too sweet. Second time I reduced to 1/3 cup and the next time am reducing it to 1/4 cup for filling.  This is huge recipe so second time I divided it up for the two of us by baking into individual pie tins and another pan that was 8 by 8 for when sons are coming.  Then I baked all and froze.  Worked fine.  Thank you very much.
2471190,61171,2012-11-01,5,"What a great recipe this is. My son loves it. I doubled the ingredients as I used a bigger baking dish, but I would advise people not to double the sugar, I would say put one and half amount of it. I did not use margarine in the apple mixture or use that much. The oats and apples make a really good combination to try."
1365025,61171,2014-01-10,3,For me this was too much rolled oats and flour. Mine turned out very dry. I think if I make this again I would use only 3/4 cup oats and 1 cup flour and more cinnamon. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup
1741243,61171,2015-06-12,3,"These are a pretty good option. I used a premade dessert product instead of the flour, and five spice blend in place of some of the cinnamon."
41809,45009,2004-06-05,5,"WOW!  There isn't a thing in the world wrong with this recipe!! It turned out lovely, indeed!!  I followed your easy directions, cooked a bunch at a time on the electric griddle, and voila!! Breakfast was served!!  I even topped them with your Homemade pancake syrup recipe #47780, and that really made this a stand-out recipe!!  Great combination, Girl, thank you so much for sharing your recipes.  You can bet I'll be making both again!! Laudee"

35193,23757,2003-02-24,5,"If I could give this more than five stars, I would.  I made this using bay shrimp and as a main dish salad.  Not unusual for me, I misread the recipe and used a whole ""bunch"" of watercress instead of 2 T.  Bergy, this is a wonderful recipe!  I love salads and veggies and this one is right at the top.  My husband loved it, too.  Thank you!"
28729,441824,2011-03-28,5,I love meatballs and this is similar to one I use so I knew it would be a winner. Baking them before adding them to the sauce is the secret for good texture.The tabasco was a nice addition...don't leave it out. :-)
265922,139424,2005-11-24,4,"I made it today!! It was great.  Added egg noodles and chunky veg. for tonights dinner. Kids loved it. Tomorrow I'll add some long grain rice and a bag of frozen veggies.

Thanks

415934,139424,2008-09-12,5,"This is a regular in our household.  I always use water in this recipe instead of chicken broth.  

I pull apart the chicken and take it off the bones in little bitesize pieces in 2 or 3 cup portions (great for using in casseroles).  I chill the broth in the fridge until it's gelatinous, scrape off the fat, then I dilute with an equal part water before I freeze it."
400708,65521,2012-10-03,5,"Hey, I can now make a smooth, creamy Roux.  I was surprised at how easy it was, didn't freeze any as I wanted to cut the recipe in half first to see how it turned out.  In the past my attempts have turned out lumpy or gritty results.  Not this time thanks to this recipe.  I used to make Hamburger Steak with onions and what an awesome result.  This is the only way to go for me with very clear and precise directions.  Next time I'll make enough to try the freezing."

How good was it???? We ate THIS dish vs. the turkey and the rest of the trimmings...yes!, it's THAT good! I had to print out copies of the recipe for everyone and we plan on making it again for Christmas.  Thank you, sarahsmomi, for this astonishingly good recipe!  "

This was such a nice change and the sauce put these sprouts over the top. With my family, this only served 4, so next time I will double the recipe. Thank you for sharing. I'm glad I chose to make this for the Zaar World Tour 2006."
219942,102677,2006-06-08,5,"I made this last night for the Zaar World Tour II, substituting Gouda cheese for the parmesan and oh MY was it DEE-lish! And very appealing to the eye. By the time I realized my camera had malfunctioned it was all in our tummies! But that's no problem because I'll be making this again and again. I'm looking forward to try it with the parmesan. The only other thing besides the cheese I did differently was to roast the brussels sprouts instead of steaming them because we think it brings out more of their flavor. I would give this more than 5 stars if posssible!  "
199848,102677,2006-06-11,5,"These Brussels sprouts are deeeeeelicious!  I added a bit more garlic, otherwise made the recipe as written.  I'll make this again; thanx!"
183964,102677,2006-06-12,5,I need no encouragement to eat brussel sprouts but I will wrestle you to the ground and call your Mama names if you try to take these off my plate. I've never had so many ingredients in a sprout dish but they work beautifully together. More flavor than you can shake a big stick at. Delicious.
129201,102677,2006-06-15,5,"Yum Leslie these are totally beautiful sprouts!!  Yes the kids did eat and enjoy them - shame cause I could have eaten them all myself!
Another one for the ""make this again"" cookbook!!"
6258,102677,2006-06-23,4,"This is a very good recipe.  I usually roast the sprouts, but I thought the crusty outsides would be soggy after adding the sauce.  The sauce has plenty of variety in flavors, and the balance was very good.  I believe you could substitute other cheeses for the parmesan, but it is really good this way.  We enjoyed this very much, and have saved this to my tried & true cookbook.  Thanks for sharing."
280271,102677,2006-09-09,4,"DH thought these were the best he has ever eaten. He gives them a 5 star. I thought the sauce took away from the flavor of the Brussel Sprouts. (which I really like). This explains why people who don't like them will eat this dish. Don't get me wrong this is a great dish and I will make it again. I just think the sauce overpowered the sprouts. 

Update 9/9/06 Here I am again. This time I knew what to expect. The sauce still took over the flavor of the sprouts but it was well worth it. This is a dish that everyone should at least try. Thanks, Leslie for posting. This is in my keeper cook book."
33159,102677,2006-10-11,4,"Very tasty way to serve brussels sprouts! I took this dish to our family Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone who was ""brave"" enough to try it, loved it!  Although the flavour is fantastic, I had a little bit of trouble with the recipe - When I heated the sauce ingredients, they stayed in solid form.  So, I added an additional 2 tbsp of butter but they started to burn before they became sauce consistency.  So, I dropped spoonfuls of ""sauce"" over the veggies & stirred vigorously until they were as evenly coated as I could get them."
233780,102677,2007-03-08,5,"We found these sprouts to really add to the meal, they had a great flavor. I served it with grilled chicken and baked potatos.. . 

It was easy to prepare everything so that the sprouts just had to be tossed as soon as they were ready. thanks for posting"
29014,102677,2008-03-16,5,"My husband pronounced these ""good"" which is huge high praise from him.  For me, they were ""easy"" ~ so two thumbs up!!"
463202,102677,2008-05-27,4,"As advertised, we ate them. :)  The sauce was heavenly.  I steamed the brussels sprouts for about 15 minutes (and according to DH, I should have salted the water) to cook them.  My 6 year old DD gobbled up her dinner portion, asked for seconds, and wanted leftovers in her lunch tomorrow. She gives this recipe 5 stars!  Made for ZWT4, thank you for posting!"
61660,102677,2008-05-31,5,Great way to do Brussels sprouts.  We both loved them and ate them all!  The bacon really compliments the flavor of the sproutss.  Keeper for sure!  Made for the Babes of ZWT4.
803511,102677,2008-06-01,5,"I am giving this 5 stars because those of us who ate them thought they were great.  However, my husband did not follow the ""They Will Eat Them"" rule.  Oh well.  Made for ZWT4."
464080,102677,2008-06-03,5,"I cheated and used ranch dip in place of the sour cream, pepper and garlic and is was SO good!!!!  Made for ZWT4."
677508,102677,2008-07-10,5,"Oh yeah this was good!  If you have always thought you didnt like brussels sprouts, you really should give this recipe a try.   I had seen a cooking show recently that had a similiar recipe to this and I knew I wanted to try it.  I can never figure out a whole lot to do with brussels sprouts except with a melted butter sauce.  So when browsing the recipes I thought I would give this one a try and I am so glad I did.  I am adding this one to our holiday meal side dishes for sure.  We enjoyed this with Recipe #100005 as part of a wonderful German meal last nite.  Made for ZWT4."
648917,102677,2008-08-12,5,The fam loves this recipe! Never a left over and always asking for more.  A+++++!
296809,102677,2008-09-08,5,What can I say that has not already been said? I love Brussels sprouts too & this is an esp good way to serve them that will appeal to those who say they really do not care for them. I served them in gratin dishes as 2nd side to pork tenderloin + garlic-parslied potato wedges ~ an easy-fix w/a great combo of flavor & texture. Thx for sharing this keeper recipe w/us. *Edited to Add* ~ IMHO most will not be able to see 3-4 of these as a serving & 4-5 servings is a more realistic yield. :-)
323186,102677,2008-09-10,5,"I also loved these, and I'm sorry to say, so did my family ...  usually I get to keep brussels all to myself since no one else really likes them.  I doled them each out a little, grudgingly, made sure I had some leftover, and bore them off to work the next day to have as lunch :)

I'll be making these again for sure!  thanks Leslie!"
138435,102677,2008-11-02,5,I join the ranks of those giving this recipe rave reviews!  My non-Brussels Sprout eating son gobbled them down.  Rather than 8 servings we only got 4 out of this because everyone wanted more.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
196369,102677,2008-12-01,5,"Want a great new side dish to complement a big dinner (like Thanksgiving or Christmas)? This is it! I asked my niece to prepare this for a Thanksgiving side dish and she did a great job, having never prepared any sort of brussels sprouts before. It's a little much for regular, everyday supper but it's absolutely terrific for special events. This dish tenons a perfect blend of flavors (especially the sprouts and the Parmesan) -- brilliantly conceived! Highly recommended."
53859,102677,2008-12-29,5,"Oh, my.  These were scrumptious.  I did double the recipe-- one recipe would definitely not make 8 servings in my house!  I also doubled the garlic.  I used frozen sprouts, microwaved with a few Tbsp. water, a few Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, sugar, and then drained and put back in the casserole I had cooked them in.  Very easy!  To make it even more so next time I will buy microwaveable fully-cooked bacon, I think.  Definitely delicious, the hard-core brussels sprouts haters didn't take any but some who usually don't like them much liked these.

Definitely not for everyday consumption, but for a special occasion these were superb."
792538,102677,2009-01-12,5,"Really good, very easy to make. Thanks for sharing."
352678,102677,2009-02-08,5,These were delicious. I prefer roasting them first (I like the nutty flavor it brings out). I did it with frozen sprouts and can imagine that fresh is much better; I'll definitely use fresh next time.
138429,102677,2009-03-12,5,"We loved these Brussels Sprouts. It will be difficult to eat plain ones after tasting this wonderful dish.
 Great tip... to score the bottom of the Brussels sprouts to allow the bitterness to escape, it really does work. 
great blend of flavors.Will certainly make this dish again. Thanks Leslie. made for Aus/Nz swap#26"
634137,102677,2009-11-14,4,"never had brussels sprouts before, these were very good. I had trouble getting the sauce smooth, so I added some cream, I also used yogurt rather than sour cream so that might have something to do with it. Very tasty for a first try though!"
755020,102677,2009-11-28,5,"Really good!  Made these for Thanksgiving dinner - followed the recipe exactly.  A few anti-brussel sprout people passed on it, but everyone that did try it loved the dish.  Will definitely be making again."
599466,102677,2009-11-30,4,"I LOVED these but my husband would only eat one, he apparently didn't like them as much as I do.  He'll eat Brussels sprouts with butter and garlic salt on them but he didn't like them this way.  I guess that means more for me!  I just used frozen Sprouts and boiled them until they were done.  Very easy to make,  thanks for the recipe!  Oh and they are just as good heated up in the microwave the next day!"
679730,102677,2009-12-01,4,Made these for Thanksgiving. Absolutely love it but I think the sauce was just a little too thick. Will definitely make it again.
984155,102677,2009-12-22,5,WOW!!!! Yummy yummy yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy! Thats all I have to say.
1462965,102677,2010-01-06,5,This was so delicious - I had 3rds.
187000,102677,2010-04-29,5,"These were very good, and a nice change of pace to the original roasted brussel sprout.(which we eat regularly. I boiled them for about 4 minutes, then sliced in half and baked in oven for about 25 minutes.until roasted. Then I poured the sauce over and baked an additonal 5 minutes. Thanks for the great dish!!!"
140132,102677,2010-05-31,4,These were really good and I will make again when my garden is in full swing.  We love brussel sprouts and this is a nice recipe to add to our collections.  Thank you for sharing this with us.
1725117,102677,2010-11-19,5,"These are fabulous!  My husband loved them, and then I made them a few nights later for a dinner for my parents.  They were a hit with everyone!  Definitely my new go-to recipe for brussels!!"
809828,102677,2010-12-17,5,These were fabulous! The sauce was perfect! Will definitely make these again!
356764,102677,2010-12-25,5,"Wow, these were fabulous! I made them for Christmas dinner and they were a hit.  I used frozen Brussels sprouts and real bacon bits, and just estimated the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks for sharing!"
142559,102677,2011-03-13,5,"I'd like to preface this review with both my husband and I loathe brussel sprouts.  Have since we were forced to eat them as little kids (although not together since we were on opposite sides of the country as little kids). However, served like this?  It has changed both of our minds.  My hubby who loudly proclaimed that there was no way in heck he would eat brussel sprouts, that they were vile tools of the devil, was intrigued when he saw me tossing them in bacon and onions.  I did sautee 1/2 of a yellow onion with the bacon and tossed the cooked brussel sprouts in the bacon/onion/bacon fat yumminess before tossing with the sour cream and cheese.  Wonderful!  I may actually add brussel sprouts to the grocery list next week.  I said 'may' :)"
504141,102677,2011-03-27,5,I was out of bacon so I added equivalent amount of French Fried Onions instead and it was very delicious.  I will definitely be making these again!!!
402057,102677,2011-05-19,5,These were fantastic!  I've never had any of my kids eat their brussel sprouts so quickly.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy I did.  Thank you!
3288,102677,2012-11-25,4,This is a nice change of pace from my usual roasted brussels sprouts. Next time I will cut them in half and pour the sauce over them instead of leaving them whole as per a previous review.  Thanks for a great recipe
242208,102677,2013-06-26,5,"Made them for myself; smaller portion of course. Loved it. The second time I made them, I added hard boiled eggs and broccoli. So easy to make and packs a full flavor. Yum. Thanks!"
165933,102677,2014-01-15,0,"Needed a change, saw this recipe and decided that it was on the menu for last night.  I don&#039;t know what else I can say but I&#039;ll add my WOW!  I mixed the sauce in a bowl while the sprouts were steaming.  After draininng the sprouts I simply added the sauce which combined with the little bit of wated left in the pot.  The pot was warm and the sprouts were warm so the sauce heated through without having to cook it seperately.  We like sprouts so there were only five left over for my breakfast!    Tasting the sauce before adding it to the sprouts made me want to try it on chicken, will do that next week!  Thanks"
137302,102677,2014-11-27,5,I can&#039;t wait to try this recipe.  I am especially intrigued by the placement of the cut X in the bottom to cut the bitterness.  I am posting this here so I will have an easier time finding the recipe when I get some brussel sprouts.
203369,102677,2016-01-18,5,2yr old liked them. 3.5yr old did not like them. 25yr old picky af daughter liked them. Husband liked them. Overall win win :) I will be making these again.
2001483924,102677,2017-12-25,5,These were delicious! I used precooked turkey bacon because that's what I had. Such good flavor &amp; easy. Thank you for the recipe.
2002354802,102677,2018-12-02,5,"Delicious! Since in cooked them for myself, I quartered the recipe and used Gruyere cheese. Very nice flavor and no bitterness! Thank you for the recipe!"
278665,155668,2006-07-20,0,"You mention garlic and nuts, but not in the list of ingredients.  How much garlic and how much and what kind of nuts?"
72489,326176,2008-11-28,5,"WOW WOW WOW!!!
I loved this dish and ate almost the whole thing by myself.  DH thought it was just ""ok"", but what does he know - LOL!  Be sure to drain the broccoli well so as not to dilute the sauce.  I will be making this on a regular basis.  Thanks for posting a great recipe."
1749106,326176,2010-12-02,5,"DELICIOUS!!! My bf had 3 heaping servings of broccoli, which by the way he never does!!!"
133174,326176,2011-08-31,5,"A wonderful way to enjoy broccoli.  The broccoli was microwaved until crisp tender, transferred to a serving dish and the wonderful sauce drizzled over all.  Thank you for posting a wonderful recipe."
513848,326176,2011-09-02,5,excellant broccoli!!! Loved it!!!
157425,326176,2013-04-30,5,"DH does not like  broccoli so I got to enjoy this all by myself. Made half the recipe but sure wished I made it all. Do get the best balsamic vinegar you can find because the sauce is fantastic. Might try one head of broccoli and one cauliflower and see how that works, I could eat this for a meal with some brown rice and not just as a side dish! Made and reviewed for PAC Spring 2013,"
1179225,326176,2014-03-26,5,So delicious!! I halved the recipe and  only used half the amount of butter and it was still fantastic. Thanks for this great new way to serve broccoli.
917000,462729,2012-07-27,5,"this was very good. I used charcoal and apple wood chips so my smoke was a little hotter, 250-300. it only took me about an hour an 45 min to get to 155 F. the sauce turned out more like a chutney but we liked it better with the apples chunkier. loved the cinnamon on the pork. thanks again"
1802823720,462729,2014-07-02,0,Absolutely loved this. Cooked to 160 to avoid pink color. Was very juicy and flavorful. Served with broccoli rabe. Leftovers made for an excellent sandwich the next day!
2000255699,462729,2015-06-08,5,"We really liked this recipe.  I didn&#039;t have paprika or chili powder so it wasn&#039;t exactly like the recipe as it is given, but how we did it really worked!  I think I&#039;ll just leave those 2 ingredients out given the one bad review that those ingredients didn&#039;t work for them.  Anyways, really good!"
2804266,462729,2015-11-16,3,"Three stars because I feel that the recipe was poorly written. I made the rub out of the first four ingredients, onion powder, paprika, salt and white pepper.  I made the apples with the cinnamon, sugar, and the rice wine vinegar.  I did not put cinnamon on the pork and I did not put paprika in the apples.  It did come out very good this way."
1072593,367247,2009-05-19,5,"Is too much of something a bad thing? Then I am oh, so bad! Made for ZWT5"
271116,179298,2007-11-25,4,"On taste I would've made these a 5.  But on preparation I would have made them a 3.  So, I gave it an average of 4.  I love the taste of the bagel pizzas.  My family loved them and  we'll be having them again. (Especially since I did OAMC and I have a bunch in the freezer).  However, the prep work was very time consuming.  I bought the amount of bagels listed and it seemed like too many so i only did about 18.  I purchased large bagels because the recipe didn't specify, but I think mini bagels would work well.  I found that I really had to be conservative on the toppings.  If you like your pizzas overloaded with toppings then you'll have to increase your ingredient amounts.This recipe is done best with a couple of people there to help with a little assembly line going.  Other than the prep work, i thought these tasted great. I may skip a couple of steps in the future, but I'll be sure to make them again!"
324390,367247,2009-05-13,5,I ate 3 of these for my birthday dinner with a cup of coffee and couldn't be happier. They are like an anise flavored snicker doodle. I was a little worried when I first started mixing the dough because it seemed a bit crumbly but everything started coming together to make a ball. Make sure to spread them out on the cookie sheet because they do spread. This would be a great recipe to get your kids to help you with because it was fun rolling them into balls. Serve them with coffee and hot chocolate for the kids and everyone will be happy! Viva las Reynas! Made for ZWT 5.
1155210,367247,2009-05-13,5,"These are good cookies, not to sweet, just right. I'm sure they would go really well with coffee as a mid morning snack or for an afternoon tea. I did change the recipe slightly. I added about 2 1/2 cups of flour, and I didn't have cream of tartar so I left that out. I also put my oven at 375F because with my oven it was too hot at 400. Thank you for sharing your mom's cookie recipe! Made for ZWT5."
47892,367247,2009-06-10,0,"The good news: these are delicious and easy to make. The cookies remind me very much of a Mexican version of snickerdoodles especially with the ""crackling"" effect on top. The bad news: the directions are not clear or concise. By stirring all ingredients together at once just doesn't work.  My changes: shortening, egg and sugar were blended with a mixer. Flour and leavening, etc. were sifted then added to the wet ingredients. I found it easier to roll the cookies in the sugar/cinnamon mix before baking. Also, I substituted raw sugar and unrefined cane sugar for granulated to roll the cookies in. Lastly,  and possible most importantly, how long to bake the cookies?  That is very important information which was not indicated. I ended up baking the cookies for a total of 10 minutes and that seemed to be the perfect amount of time with my range.  I don't like to give star ratings below 4,  a comment will suffice and I'll leave it at that. Reviewed for ZWT 2009."
161282,105811,2005-01-03,4,Very good dip! Served it in my new fondue pot to keep it warm. I added a few tablespoons of bacon bits and a little cilantro. 'Tostitos Gold' chips were the perfect dippers. Thanks for posting!
517157,105811,2007-06-13,5,YUMMY! Love this stuff! (:
89831,105811,2007-10-06,4,"great dip but needs more zip, I added in Tabasco and increased the taco seasoning, also added in fresh garlic, will make again, and mabey add in an onion next time, thanks for sharing LizAnn!...Kitten"
377161,105811,2010-06-12,5,"Tasty for being so easy and fast to do. Loved the simplicity of it.
Thanks for sharing!!"
911006,105811,2014-01-04,5,"Way back in the early 90&#039;s we made this same recipe in Home Ec class. Loved it then, love it now.  Easy and delish!"
280271,429928,2010-07-05,5,"Wow! This is really yummy. It is dense so don't expect the fluffy whipped type of mashed potatoes. I used a masher not a mixer. There is very little liquid in the recipe but it is so good. I love the cheeses in this. Didn't really taste the nutmeg, maybe because the cheese is so dominate. I cut the recipe in half and used my small oval baking dish. It made enough for four servings. So the total recipe would serve at least 8. This is a must try dish. It's so good that it's going in my best of 2010 cookbook. Thanks for posting. :)"
383346,204114,2011-12-17,5,This is a great healthy smoothie.  I used berry yogurt instead of plain.  Thanks kitsmomma :)  Made for Bargain Basement tag game
305531,429928,2010-11-04,5,"These are TDF!! I also halved the recipe, however we loved these so much we must have eaten much more than TeresaS because I'm guessing we got 3 servings. :lol: I added a little more milk and upped the nutmeg a little based on Teresa's review. I love goat cheese and they really took these potatoes over the edge. Thanks Loula for a delicious side. I too am adding this recipe to my Best of 2010 cookbook. Made for Went To The Market Tag."
286566,429928,2010-12-01,5,"Scaled this back for 3 of us and used a small square casserole dish to bake it is and used the goats cheese and we all thoroughly enjoyed.  For the cheese I used pregrated pizza mix (mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan.  Thank you Lalaloula for a great mashed potato recipe, made for ZAAR Stars under the 24 hour rule."
318262,429928,2011-02-21,4,"These were good - great concept but I feel like it just needed a bit more of everything. I ended up doubling the goat cheese, tripled the spices and had to add a lot of extra salt and pepper. Thanks for the posting!"
330545,429928,2011-04-19,0,Followed the recipe using Chèvre.  After taste-testing I added a small amount of milk and another 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. Since we like our cheese ooey-gooey I did not let the tops brown but did add a sprinkling of of green onions.  I might do this again (this time with Neufchâtel) but will make my regular mashed and continue on from there as we all found the texture too heavy.  Made four individual casseroles for RS#51.
61660,429928,2012-04-24,5,"I love goat cheese and so even though I halved the recipe I kept the original amount of goat cheese. Yes this is a denser mashed potato than I usually make but still very good.  I used the leftovers to make fried potato patties the next day, those were good too!"
597235,16912,2011-08-07,5,"We love this recipe! I have the same Betty Crocker book and discovered this recipe in it not too long ago.  Fantastic flavor, so simple and plain looking but full of flavor.  Great dipped in coffee!  One note I would make is that when I first made this recipe, I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening like the recipe states.  The next time I used 1 c. butter instead of part shortening.  They turned out just fine except I had used salted butter so they had a bit of a saltiness to them, kind of interesting, but if I use all butter next time I will either use unsalted butter or leave out the tsp. of salt.  Give these a try, you won't be disappointed!"
679953,423683,2011-07-15,5,"Overall a good recipe, that I served with some spaghetti.  Made recipe as posted though in the future you may want to watch the cooking time.  Made for Holiday Tag."
242766,393658,2010-03-31,5,"Delicious!  This wonderful soup goes together very quickly and easily.  I used red potatoes (I left the skins on), and 4 large leeks from my garden.  I coarsely mashed the potatoes before serving, leaving the soup chunky.  I served the leftovers cold the next day and my family really liked it that way, too.  Thank you for sharing this easy, delicous recipe.
*Made for Spring 2010 PAC*"
217482,123651,2005-05-27,5,Thank you for posting this recipe. It was a hit with my children. I think it would be good with ribs too!
188284,123651,2005-06-06,4,"Hi, lovely chicken. We just had it for dinner. Used sunflower oil instead of the canoa, and 2 garlic cloves instead of granules. Will definetely make it again."
186855,123651,2007-01-16,4,"This wasn't bad at all :)  I did change it up just a bit.  I didn't like all that oil, so I substituted with broth.  I also added a few teaspoons of Five Spice Powder.  I think next time I'll try it with skinless chicken, and marinade it in the sauce for a little before baking.  Very tender too! Bet this would be great with ribs too.  Thanks Oolala"
15718,378881,2009-07-12,5,"This was very simple to put together. The flavors went well together, and I found it very refreshing. The nuts added a nice crunch to the salad and was a good flavor compliment to the strawberries. The color combination was ascetically pleasing as well. A real keeper. I will definately make this one again!"
131126,378881,2009-07-14,5,"I served this over a mix of spring greens and with grilled fish and a simple potato. The sweetness of the strawberries & then sharp feta taste were well balanced. I thought it was something one would see on a restaurant menu. My family liked the dressing as is, but I added cracked black pepper at the table."
58104,378881,2009-07-14,5,"THANK YOU! I just enjoyed the winning recipe! 
Love this except for the high fat content! It is so worth the extra workout!!!! And for the most part a healthy fat. To lower next time I would use 1/2 the avocado and up the strawberries. I did skip the sugar and didn`t miss it! Great job."
133174,378881,2009-07-14,4,This is an easy summer salad. I used fresh tarragon for the dressing and it was delicious. Good luck in the contest.
186855,378881,2009-07-14,4,"Very pretty and colourful, and couldn't be easier to make.  However, my taste buds felt it needed something...not exactly sure what though.  You don't want anything too strong because you don't want to overpower the avocado nor the strawberries.  I thought the tarragon would be enough, but maybe I need to increase the amount.  I'll have to give that a try. Thanks for submitting such a creative entry, and good luck in the contest."
171790,378881,2009-07-14,4,"I loved the dressing for this salad. I used fresh tarragon from the garden instead of dried. The presentation was lovely. It wasn't as well received by the family as I'd hoped, however. Made for Craze-E Contest"
464080,378881,2009-07-14,5,I really loved this salad. . .made it 3 time already.  I made it as written the first time and then the following 2 times I subbed dried basil for the tarragon.  Also used almonds one time and candied pecans another. . .they were each good!
865936,378881,2009-07-16,4,A really nice salad.  It has all the elements I like in a salad - contrasting flavors/textures and a little crunch.  Great job!
1306655,378881,2014-02-14,4,It was okay. I forgot to add the avocado so maybe that is why I found it just okay. I didn&#039;t like the dressing which is odd because usually all I use on my salads is red wine vinegar and oil. I am going to make it again though and do something different with dressing.
251917,291716,2008-09-29,5,FALL PAC 2008: Cathy - this beef was really tasty!! I like the BBQ sauce that the ingredients make - really good!!
305531,187840,2006-10-02,5,"This is great. We started out using this as a dip, but then started using it as a sauce on the asparagus, potatoes, and the meat. Great recipe Sharon.  Thanks for posting."
37107,187840,2007-04-19,5,"This was soooooo good!  I made this with our ham on Easter Sunday and served with asparagus and brussel sprouts.  I have to make more and use it as a vegetable dip or chip dip.  We'll dip anything into it.  I added 2 tablespoons (misread the ""teaspoons"") and it was excellent.  We love wasabi and it was not overpowering.  It added such a nice flavour.  I will definitely recommend this to anyone!  Thanks for posting.
I just made this again a couple of weeks after my original review and we actually used it as a salad dressing and always use leftovers for fresh veggies."
234062,16327,2007-04-01,4,"This was really good! A very unusual taste for spinach. It was quite sweet, but then I forgot to add the parmesan :0P! Never mind, it was really good and I'll certainly make spinach this way again! Especially since it's a creamy spinach without the fat of cream."
512309,16327,2008-10-17,4,"Very good, very easy, and much lower fat than a standard ""creamed"" spinach recipe!  I love yogurt to replace sour cream or heavy cream.  I didn't drain my yogurt, because it is pretty thick to begin with.  I used 2% plain yogurt, homemade, and one box (10 oz.) of frozen chopped spinach.  The kids didn't love this, but DH and I sure did!  Thanks, Sherry Karaoke!"
1353074,16327,2011-02-23,0,"I was very hopeful for this recipe, but it was a ""fail"" for me. :o(  It's only my fault for not knowing that if you put too much heat to yogurt it will curdle.  I used Greek yogurt and added it to my cooked fresh spinach, THEN (about 15 seconds later) turned the heat off.  I was bummed because creamed spinach is one of my favorites and this ended up like spinach with cottage cheese mixed in.  I'll try again, though!"
803511,187840,2008-07-27,5,This is a great way to eat asparagus.  The dip is so rich and spicy and goes well with the bright flavor of the blanched asparagus.  A definate make again!
1482201,187840,2009-12-13,5,I got this recipe years ago from a caterer friend and have made it many times.  I did it last night for a Christmas party and it was a BIG hit.  Thanks.
244264,187840,2010-01-26,5,"I loved this recipe.  I didn't have wasabi, so substituted 1/2 chinese hot mustard and 1/2 horseradish.  Maybe that makes it another dish but it was yummy."
1244849,187840,2010-05-04,5,This is delicious!  Thank you for posting!
913636,187840,2010-05-09,4,Made this for a side with Mahi Mahi and asparagus - tasty!  Added onion powder.
1269015,187840,2010-09-24,4,"I love this sauce, and it is definitely my favorite way to eat veggies now. But, I prefer to roast the asparagus in oil for 12 minutes at 400*F or to fry it in a tablespoon of oil for 5 minutes over the much faster blanching. It just wasn't crisp enough for my liking."
239758,187840,2010-10-18,5,Sensational combination of flavours. Made the sauce exactly as written using Recipe #207860 for the mayo. I can imagine many more uses for this wonderful sauce -- tonight we also drizzled it on our steaks and mashed potatoes. I think I'll make it again this week as a dip for Friday night drinks at work. Thanks so much for posting.
780172,187840,2011-04-12,5,"What a great, simple and quick sauce. It sure kicks asparagus up a notch. We had quite a bit leftover, so will try it on some other veggies later in the week. Next time I will be braver and add a little more of the wasabi paste."
166642,244443,2008-11-14,5,"This sandwich does live up to its name! I enjoy trying all different kinds of grilled cheese sandwiches and this one was delicious! I loved the combination of ingredients - they go perfectly together. I used about 1/4 of a sliced Vidalia onion and it was just right for me. You have to be careful the onions don't slide off, but this one is a keeper. Thanks for sharing."
1615781,267454,2010-05-15,5,This is really good even my picky kids asked me to make it again for breakfast bread..
175475,234952,2009-10-24,3,"Well...I have never before tried a recipe that wasn't already rated, but since I have this (misunderstood) obsession with anything Amish, I decided to try it.  I had to make adjustments since I live over 7,000 ft.(incl. cutting out 6tb of sugar) The dough is VERY dry and crumbly.  I had to form balls with my hands and press down.  It created a dense but very chewy cookie.  I didn't think it had much flavor (i even added cinnamon) but that could be because I cut down on the sugar due to the HA adj.  I added an add'l tsp of liquid. Everyone else in the fam loved them though .  They are more filling than the typical cookie, more cake-like.   I will make them again, but up the sugar a little."
169430,262654,2008-04-14,4,Lovely recipe without added sugar (YAY). The natural sugars in the squash and cinnamon being a sweet spice make a very nice combo that is sweet enough. This will be good year round. It took mine about 35 mins @ 350 for the 2nd baking.
469903,262654,2009-03-25,5,Squash comes out tender and moist by cooking this way - would definatly use this cooking method again! I used the optional raisins and they plumped up nicely while cooking. I used 1/2T oil for both squash (1/4T each). I removed them from the oven after 30 minutes and they were cooked through - although I was only cooking one squash.  DH and I each enjoyed half - will be making again!  Made for Pick-A-Chef Spring 2008.
582221,407385,2010-01-24,0,These cookies were bland and dry.
35140,52190,2003-01-27,5,Yum-yum.  This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't change a thing.
27961,52190,2003-03-03,5,"Fantastic rice recipe! The only small change I made was to use 2 oz of bacon that I had fried, cumbled, and frozen, along with 1 tbl of bacon grease. I think this will be a very common rice dish at our house. Thanks!"
58605,52190,2003-03-05,5,Just served this rice with some broiled fish.  It is very tasty.  I couldn't resist adding a cup those great diced tomatoes that comes in a can.  We will have this very often. Thanks!
67835,52190,2003-03-14,5,"My husband loved this dish.  Said it tasted just like the rice you get in Chinese restaurants.  I didn't change a thing!  I like how fluffy this is, not mushy at all."
80778,52190,2003-06-24,5,"Very easy to make and a great variation from regular rice.  I've made this several times with different types of meat, but I used brown rice.  Everyone I served it to has LOVED it!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
40047,52190,2004-01-08,4,"Really nice change from my usual chicken based Rice. I did use roasted garlic.
T."
38865,52190,2004-01-19,5,"Delicious, we will enjoy this often."
89420,52190,2004-01-21,5,"I can rate this without cooking it because this is how I fixed, what I call my own version, for a lot of years. It really is so good, and I am glad to see that it finds approval."
56112,52190,2004-10-03,5,Great recipe and so easy to fix.  It is the bacon that does the trick.  Thanks for the great recipe.
57475,52190,2005-03-29,5,"This was fantastic. The flavor was impressive with such simple ingredients. I sauteed some cut up chicken in a separate skillet then mixed the bacon fried rice and the chicken together and WOW, what a great meal!!"
166019,52190,2005-10-20,5,I have tried so many fried rice recipes and this really is the perfect one. The bacon adds so much flavor. Thanks for posting. 
24386,52190,2005-12-09,5,"Absolutely the best fried rice I have ever had!  The bacon adds such a depth of flavor. I did add an extra egg, because I like it that way. I will definitely keep this in my high priority recipe file.  Thanks so much for posting."
50509,52190,2005-12-10,4,"This was a nice change for breakfast. I did not use the soy sauce or garlic, and added a couple of sliced mushrooms. I also changed the order of cooking a bit: bacon, then mushrooms and white parts of scallion, the rice, then the egg. Topped with green parts of scallion."
49918,52190,2006-09-14,5,Yummy!  I couldn't help myself - I used 3 slices of bacon.  I also used plain white onion because that's what was in the fridge.  I used lite soy sauce but I think I'll use regular next time.  Might add one more slice of bacon too.  I also added half of a small can of peas.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  Thanks so much for posting it!
355637,52190,2007-03-11,2,"Okay, I see all these great reviews, and wonder if I did something wrong... but this wasn't that good for me. Maybe I put too much garlic powder, I don't know. Won't make this again."
122878,52190,2007-04-11,3,"This rice was quick and easy to make, but I guess I'm just used to oomph in that flavor department; it was a bit bland for me, but it was by no means unpleasant.  I would have to say that it is a kid-friendly side dish as my grandson asked for seconds.  The instructions were very well written, and I made it exactly as suggested.  I made no additions or substitutions.  Thank yo Lady Di Shea, for your contribution to our menu.  I served these with Judy's awesome lumpia which is posted on zaar as well."
53932,52190,2008-05-03,5,"Great taste for so few ingredients.  I halved the recipe, but still used one egg and the full amount of bacon."
456799,52190,2008-10-21,5,"My mom came back from a vacation once and brought us this recipe. Bacon Rice has become a favorite in our home since. I make mine a little differently but it is the same concept. I cook a pound or two of bacon and drain it, leave a couple of tablespoons of oil in the pan then I brown onion and garlic in the skillet and dump in my rice and fry it a bit then add water and cook the rice. When the rice is almost done I toss in a handful of frozen peas or carrots the soy sauce and then when the rice is completely cooked just before serving I toss the crumbled bacon in. This is a very tasty recipe! I do add the green onions when I have them. If I happen to have left over cooked rice I will make it more similar to the recipe posted here but my family loves rice so there usually is not any leftover so I start this dish from scratch.
I am glad to see this recipe here!! It is a keeper!"
174722,52190,2009-01-20,5,"Really good...fairly thrifty too! I added some leftover peas I had in the fridge just before serving. Definatley a ""keeper""!!"
362983,52190,2009-04-02,5,Easy and yummy! I threw in slices of Chinese sausage as well. Perfect way to use leftover rice. Thanks!
140132,52190,2009-06-15,5,"Oh wow this is good.  DD couldn't quit eating this before our dinner was ready....lol.  I loved the bacon in this.  I did add some celery along with the green onions, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us."
2142572,52190,2012-01-10,4,"I added a few things.  Added a couple handfuls of fresh bean sprouts and I also cut bacon up before frying (use 1/3 of a lb) along with 3 or 4 tbsps of soy sauce, which I put in same skillet right before the rice.  Also add chopped up sweet onion and a couple tsp of sugar to soy sauce.  This is the most requested dish from all my friends and family."
789516,52190,2012-03-15,3,"This was good, but a little bland for us."
91584,52190,2016-08-23,5,Excellent. I tripled the bacon amount and used 3 eggs
2001967617,52190,2018-02-01,5,very nice recipe . although we are bacon lovers and used a pound . i added some celery and some ginger. everyone in my home loved it!
1170213,123758,2009-04-08,4,Good recipe. I used this in a chicken pot pie recipe. thank you for posting.
424680,287382,2008-04-14,5,"Got lazy making this recipe & DIDN'T use any pastry, so it ended up more like a cobbler, I suppose! BUT, the taste was there, & that's what counts! Used my ol' standby, Granny Smiths! Baked it from the start at 350 degrees F & the apples were tender in just a little over half an hour! [Made & reviewed for one of my adopted chefs in this Spring's PAC]"
296809,220143,2007-05-09,4,"A very satisfying PAC choice, MsPia. I am an avocado lover & have used it in many appys, salads & desserts, but never in potatoes. I made a half recipe as written & found the mellow avocado flavor to be strongly & perfectly present. My avocado was nicely ripe & gave the potatoes a creamy texture w/o adding milk. I served them in the avocado shell topped w/a sml dollop of sour cream & sprinkled w/lemon-pepper seasoning salt because I wanted those flavors stronger. All that said, my only issue here is the amt of butter & a prep method that seems more complex than it needs to be. To satisfy myself I made a 2nd half recipe using std methods, 1/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup + fresh lemon juice & minced garlic. I found the outcome equally satisfying & I am sure improved the nutritional info. Lastly, this mixture does not prevent the usual discoloration using avocado. DH worked late unexpectedly & the *avocado boats* were put in the microwave to be rewarmed. The darker color was not evident till we began to eat them, so I suggest covering w/plastic wrap for later use in that situation. Thx for sharing this unique use of the lovely avocado. :-)"
1979825,220143,2011-08-10,3,"Gave it 3 stars because I did not make this recipe, but this idea did not carry over to pre-cooked mashed potatoes.  <br/><br/>Mixed fork-crushed avocado with stiff mashed potatoes; rested on stove 10 minutes while we had salad.  Potatoes & avocado had turned to SOUP in the meantime.  <br/><br/>WARNING:  Might be OK made exactly as stated and served immediately... but turned my leftover mashed potatoes into soup!"
2234462,220143,2012-04-08,5,Great recipe..... really flavorful
220348,220143,2012-09-21,5,I really love this recipe. It's creamy and flavourful. And I love the added texture of the avocados. Really wonderful.
2001694848,220143,2018-02-24,5,My husband really liked these mashed potatos - the lemony butter was a big hit. I did make a correction to the recipe to mash the avocados so that they fold in without lumps. I will definitely make this recipe again.
383346,506356,2013-10-07,5,"This is so yummy.  I made it only for me with 2 small apples.  Of course, we have to use firm apples.  It was a great dessert.  Thanks Bonnette :)  Made for PRMR tag game"
2501187,264786,2016-01-13,5,"I am giving this 5 stars because if I followed the directions exactly, I am sure it would be delicious. Tonight I used it for frying chicken filet strips. I added more spices to the flour. These consist of a few shakes of each of these; Poultry seasoning, Garlic powder, crushed Red Pepper, and Paprika.  I imagine for fish, adding Old Bay seasoning would add a nice flair to it. It says great for chicken too but didn&#039;t use it this time.  I flattened chicken filets with mallet and course salted and course peppered it on both sides then cut it quarters or thirds.  I added the buttermilk to the flour mixture and mixed well. I, then added the chicken, mixed and put in fridge while I did other things. When cast iron skillet was ready, fried them! They were great! I will use more lard next time though. It was too shallow this time. This one is a keeper. I wanted to find SIMPLE this one is it. Thanks!!"
132886,86447,2004-03-18,5,"It took me 15 minutes to prepare, but I am not known for my cooking skills.  I added more garlic (3 cloves) because I love it, 2 tbsp of vegetable oil (would reduce to one next time and may eliminate altogether on the 3rd try).  The salmon is oily by itself.  I would also reduce the soy sauce to taste (too salty for my taste buds to add indiscrimately).  I didn't combine the tomatos (I thought they would make the salad watery), but ate them on the side with wheat pita bread and lettuce.  I think reducing the soy and oil will not affect the flavor.  With all these changes, I really loved this recipe and thank Jaaynee for posting it.  This is not a 'diet' recipe, but a nice change from salads made with mayo.    "
201581,265395,2011-01-03,5,Made this for a quick and warming lunch today. Very easy and satisfying. I did add a little dried parsley and dill weed for flavor and used low sodium chicken broth. Thanks for posting Glo! Made for Recipe Swap #47.

281701,173235,2006-07-12,5,"This sounded strange to me, but I went ahead and tried it, since I had an avocado lying in the bottom of the fridge.  It was actually good! It wasn't as ""heavy"" as regular shakes, and the very light avocado taste was refreshing.  If you like avocados, this is worth trying!!  I didn't use any sugar, but that's just me.  Most people might like for it to be a little sweeter.  Thanks for allowing me to expand my horizons a bit!!"
296809,173235,2006-07-15,5,"Using avocado in desserts has been 1 of my favourite ZWT finds. I actually entered an avocado dessert recipe myself because I love the avocado flavour & the idea appealed to me. Then I tried a couple others & found I really liked them, so I was on a mission to find another. I’m sure glad I did because this was terrific! Thx for posting."

27783,45788,2002-11-27,3,"I adore avocado, garlic, citrus and honey, and the combination of these ingredients into a dressing sounded appealing to me. If you follow the measurements of each ingredient as directed, the dressing comes out far too sweet and lacking in seasonings, despite the hefty punch of fresh garlic and the fresh cracked pepper.  I felt it needed salt or perhaps some fresh herbs to give it a more rounded flavor, and far less honey.  I think this recipe shows great potential - next time I will experiment with adding additional seasonings - perhaps a minced shallot as well, and reduce the honey to just 1 tsp."
67656,274947,2008-04-07,3,"Getting ready to shed the winter clothes in anticipation of spring, I've been focusing on fruit based treats.  Since I love apples, this recipe instantly appealed to me.  The results here were fairly good - apples were wonderfully tender and moist and the sugar, butter, juice and cinnamon formed a nice sauce over the fruit. Good baked apples that went well with my non fat frozen yogurt.  My one note was that one does get a trace of flavor from the leaf so my inclination would be to go with parchment alone though the cabbage leaf does add to the moistness.  For me the largest drawback to this dish is the fussiness of the preparation given the results.  After 10 minutes or so of trying to form a circular tart I simply created two rows for each of my parcels. Was satisfied with that choice given that it was also difficult to move the dessert to dessert plates without disrupting the configuration. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
326348,127048,2007-05-28,5,"This sauce is excellent. I served it with deep fried turkey and my entire family loved it. The only thing I did differently was that for the raisins, in addition to the raisins I also added flaved craisans in orange, cherry, strawberry, cranberry, and dried mixed berries to equal the 1 1/2 cups of chopped raisins to give the sauce a mixed fruity flaver.

305531,188041,2006-12-01,5,Great way to  make asparagus. Simple and tasty. The balsamic vinegar was a nice touch. Thanks Kitten for another keeper.

713116,287499,2008-03-05,4,"Yum!  As a disclaimer, I made this for myself only - DH doesn't like wilted spinach (understatement), and I knew better than to try this one on the kids, even though they're good eaters.  :)
That said, this was excellent, with subtle flavors to complement the spinach.  I love sesame oil, and it makes the recipe.  
I did use regular spinach instead of baby, so in the pic, you can see some of the stems.  Baby spinach would have been even better, but none on hand tonight.
Thanks for sharing!"

4470,287499,2008-08-29,5,It is easy & tasty.  The garlic & soy gives a just  right little perk to the spinach.  It took 5 minutes to prepare.
142335,287499,2008-12-04,5,Yum...so good! I added some crushed red pepper and topped it off with sesame seeds. This goes great with asian marinated flank steak. So glad you posted this and so glad I found this.
358513,287499,2010-05-24,5,Very nice recipe I only thought it was missing Toasted Sesame Seeds. I Threw mine into the oil right before the Spinach and used only sesame oil. Thank you this is a keeper. Made for ZWT 6 for Looney Spoon Phoodies :)
58104,287499,2010-06-29,5,OK I did use Swiss chard fresh out of the garden subbing the main ingredient. But it was tender and flavorful. I found a great sub for spinach. Added some ginger along with the garlic. Used 1 teaspoon low sodium soy. Garnished with toasted seasame seeds.Thanks. Made for ZWT6
1736962,287499,2011-01-23,5,"Delicious and easy to prepare. I would make this again, thanks for sharing."
653438,287499,2012-01-05,4,Made for Turning Over a New Leaf Diabetic Forum...very tasty and quite easy!  I followed the instructions only using a little less of the oils and adding a few red pepper flakes.  Served with Korean roasted chicken and jasmine garlic/ginger rice.  Thank you for submitting the recipe.
2667031,287499,2017-04-26,5,Simple and tasty. I made this to go with Ahi Tuna with wasabi butter and avocado.
47907,150622,2006-05-03,5,I LOVE oatmeal raisin cookies and this recipe does not disappoint!  I like mine slightly chewy so I baked them until they were barely cooked on top ~ YUM!  Thanks for posting!
137302,150622,2010-03-30,5,I finally found a recipe similar enough to my missing favorite Oatmeal Cookie recipe to replace the original!  What a joy!  I followed the directions for a crispy cookie since that is the kind I like.  My dough was too sticky to make into balls so I just made nice big blobs by dropping onto the parchment paper with a Tablespoon instead.  Worked great...and tasted even better!  I discovered the last minute that I didn't have any raisins in my cupboard so since it was an option anyway I substituted chopped pecans.  I will make these over and over in the future!  Thanks No Brussel Sprouts...for a terrific recipe.  BTW I got 4 1/2 dozen from the recipe.   Made for Spring PAC 2010.
139381,506589,2013-09-04,5,"I can tell you right off the bat, this is the exact recipe that my mother used.  I have found it fail-proof, and right up to her standards.  I spent years trying to make &quot;her&quot; biscuits.  This is a &quot;spot on&quot; method.  Thanks for posting!!!!"
41578,147611,2005-12-13,5,"This makes an excellent wrap!  The onion/chive cream cheese along with the horseradish and ranch dressing is a perfect compliment to the rest of the ingredients.  Wraps are a nice change-of-pace from regular sandwiches and I guarantee you won't be disappointed with this one.  You did good, Carolinerenee, thanks so much for sharing this.  It's a winner for sure!
"
189616,147611,2006-08-23,5,"Caroline, the name really fits these wraps-they indeed were Awesome! Mine were a little milder though, I didn't have any prepared horseradish so I used Horseradish sauce, and used monterey jack instead of pepper-jack. I really couldn't imagine this tasting any better than how it was!
Thank You!"
196369,147611,2006-09-21,5,"carolinerenee, I made these last night and could NOT quit eating them! The roast beef and the horseradish go together hand-in-glove and the idea of a wrap is so much better than the traditional sandwich. I exprimented a bit after the first round and I found that I liked them best with Hellman's brand Dijonaise, which is a blend of dijon mustard, horseradish and mayo. It seems the perfect blend for this wrap. Still, on a warm summer day with a cold beer, I could go for an additional spread of the horseradish in addition to the Dijonaise. I think next time, I'm also going to try some roasted red pepper slices (from a jar) and, having now also tried it with baby swiss cheese, I think I'll stay with that for awhile. But honestly, your original recipe is just killer -- any changes aren't at all an improvement -- just adjustments for personal tastes. Thanks for posting one of the best ones yet! big pat."
172369,147611,2008-04-06,5,"Big it at my party and they looked beatiful cut in half on a diagonal.
Thanks for a great recipe."
2475207,147611,2012-10-30,5,Simply delicious! My 8 and 9 year old boys made these themselves following this recipe...they loved them!!
216736,18148,2005-06-06,5,Amazing!  I made it just the way described.  I served this at a large party with a large spread of food.  The crowd hovered over this dish until it was devoured.  I will definately make this for the next party.  
421173,18148,2007-01-02,5,"My family and friends love this recipe and it is a must at all functions.

You will not be disappointed when presenting this wonderful recipe."
705405,18148,2007-12-27,5,"This was SO EASY - I forgot to put the butter on top because I was going by memory... just spread on some sour cream, sprinkled a layer of brown sugar, and put on the pecans and baked.  Everyone loved it... no one could tell what I put on top of the brie.  No one would ever guess how easy this is to make - people were hovered around it the whole night. THANKS!"
453758,18148,2007-12-28,5,"Excellent Brie recipe! It was the first thing I ran out of on my cheese tray. Next time I will double the brown sugar and pecans and add another teaspoon of butter. Thanks
Miss Erin!"
698914,18148,2007-12-29,5,"A Perfect 10 in my book! This is one of those show-stopper appetizers that is also easy to prepare, and what could be better than that? 
I used a larger Brie, so doubled the toppings and it was a huge hit. I've made a similar recipe in the past that didn't require the higher cooking temp at the end of the baking time and I think it's much better this way. I served it with a new cracker I found at Sam's Club called Carr's Cheese Melts which made for a great combination in flavors. Thanks for this yummy recipe, Miss Erin."
28784,18148,2008-02-10,5,This is the best brie I have had or made.  I served it for a party and people couldnt stop talking about it.  I will make it again and again.  Thanks
48920,18148,2008-04-05,5,"This was not only delicious, but beautiful as well.  I baked a 20 oz. wheel so increased topping amounts.  I melted just the right amoun when cut into.  Served with presliced baguette and presliced green apples that made it a snap at serving time.  Thank you!!!"
608500,18148,2008-06-27,5,A definate hit for brie lovers.  A sophisticated and yummy appie!!
64631,18148,2009-01-31,5,I made this for a girls's night of drinks and appy's - this was unbeliveable!  LOVE IT !  will definitly be making again - thank you!
522230,18148,2009-05-07,5,"This recipe exceeded our expectations and turned out to be the best part of our girls lunch! Almost like dessert! May add raisins and cinnamon next time, but no need to mess with a fab recipe!
(We used plain yogurt in place of sour cream with no adverse effects.) THANK YOU!"
400708,18148,2009-06-24,5,"Well you sure don't need anymore steriling reviews but had to add mine to this. I was looking for something fast, easy and impressive to serve to last minute guest with wine and this fit the bill - had everything in the pantry and it was perfect. This is the first time I've ever had ""baked"" brie but I assure you it won't be the last. Such an unexpected pleasure with the melting cheese against the sweet of the caramilized pecans - YUM, still thinking about it. Not a crumb was left and everyone was looking for more. I made it exactly as listed right down to serving with apples, crackers and home made sourdough baguettes. Thanks to you, I looked like a pro in the kitchen, and DH wants to know when we'll have it again. Thanks Miss Erin for sharing.  As an update, made this again with continued rave reviews, but this time found a round ""mini"" pie dish that was perfect for the round brie and toppings and looked even better - I'm posting a picture of that to show how great it looked."
72135,18148,2009-12-10,5,"easy, special, and delicious!  i have made this twice and the second time used slivered almonds instead of pecans, and added a handful of dried cranberries.  fantastic and festive either way!"
284180,18148,2010-01-01,5,"I was looking for a baked brie recipe without puff pastry.  This was perfectl!  I didn't add the butter and I'm glad I didn't as it was plenty rich without it.  My brie wheel was 20 oz, so I cut it in half to make 2 wheels and just used one.  I put it cut-side up in my dish and then topped and baked as directed.  Yummy!  Can't wait to make the second wheel. :)"
237624,18148,2010-02-08,4,really good... but take care to not eat it straight out of the oven as it will burn the roof of your mouth!  two days later i'm still uncomfortable!  oops!  i also added craisins.  a nice alternative to my usual brie topping: orange ginger preserves (which is also delicious).
1462462,18148,2010-04-16,5,EXCELLENT recipe.  I made it for a large gathering which included fans of Brie and those who supposedly didn't care for it.  The slight sweetness really enhances the flavor and converted some new fans!  Very simple to make.
262312,18148,2010-09-19,5,"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet!  I've probably made this 5 times in the last 2 years for parties, Thanksgiving, etc.  Everyone always loves this!  It's so easy to put together and had a nice WOW factor.  I always serve with crackers and apple slices.  Nice change from the usual brie with preserves."
680680,18148,2010-11-08,5,I decided to make this appetizer for a girls' night at my house and it was a huge hit! I put the ingredients together in a baking dish and left it covered in the refrigerator until I was ready to bake it. No one had tried this before and it was gone before I had a chance to grab seconds! I used more pecans than suggested - I kept adding until the top was completely covered - then added more brown sugar as well. I will definitely make this again! Very easy and very classy.
1584828,18148,2010-11-29,5,This did not make it past the second day over Thanksgiving!  Very easy to make and completely satisfying!
386585,18148,2010-11-29,5,"A real crowd-pleaser!  I made this exactly as posted, except I added some dried cranberries.  This could not be easier and was a great hit on Thanksgiving.  Thanks for sharing!"
398047,18148,2010-12-19,5,I made this as part of a birthday dinner for my boyfriend. Such an easy recipe and tastes so great! He loved the taste of this and wants it again.
1134072,18148,2010-12-29,5,"This was soooo yummy!!!  We added chopped apple, craisins, and more pecans and brown sugar, and . . . mmmmm!!!  We will be having this again for sure.  Thanks!"
587361,311786,2010-05-05,5,Thank you lifesaver!
190402,311786,2012-04-17,5,"Thanks, this also worked for me in a pinch!!"
928301,311786,2013-06-14,5,worked well for me.  nice and easy.  I just may never buy balsamic vinegar again since I can use red wine vinegar easily for either request.
136249,311786,2015-04-21,5,Great! Thanks for saving my day and my recipe!
461834,492961,2013-03-26,5,"Wonderful change to the everyday burger!!!  I made 1/4 of the amounts, for my lunch, which I just served with some chips.  To me, the soy sauce was more then enough for basting the burger and would cut that back next time, but definitely makes/flavors the burger.  I couldn&#039;t find a poppy seed hamburger roll, so just used my store&#039;s bakery, Chicago Hard Roll, that I toasted.  I liked it as written, but enjoyed it even more with some mustard and onions.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Spring 2013 PAC."
542615,507176,2013-10-21,5,This recipe is so moist &amp; delicious! Will definately make these again &amp; again! The icing is a great finishing touch for these!
1802501758,507176,2014-02-17,5,This really turned out good. Very moist and yummy! I had to add a little more milk to the icing to get it the consistency. Delicious. I will make these again
2879820,507176,2014-04-29,5,I&#039;ve made these twice and both times everyone has loved them!! This recipe is great. It makes a full sheet pan. Great for parties!! Wouldn&#039;t change a thing about recipe. I will be making these banana bread brownies again and again!!
2116904,507176,2015-01-13,5,"I saw this posted on FB this morning and I made the recipe this afternoon...it looked THAT good! Yes, it tastes as good as it looks, too. I&#039;m not the biggest fan of banana tastes but this banana bread brownie is truly amazing. It&#039;s moist, sweet, flavorful and memorable. Both my kids and my husband had 3 helpings tonight for dessert! I will definitely be making these again for dessert and for parties. Yum!!"
1803660036,507176,2015-01-14,0,"If you let your bananas ripen to where the peeling is black, it will be even more flavorful and moist!  I have not made this recipe yet, but once I do, I will let you know how it comes out. Can&#039;t wait to try it."
1803679276,507176,2015-01-19,5,Just made these tonight.  AMAZING.  But the only thing I was unclear on was the butter; it didn&#039;t specify whether the butter had to be salted or unsalted.  I used unsalted; still tasted really good.
1803682007,507176,2015-01-19,2,I also saw this on FB and made them last night.  Way too sweet for my family.  I&#039;m not really sure why they are called brownies because they are really just very moist banana bread squares.  Although they were yummy (with out the frosting) I will not make them again because my banana bread recipe is better.
5456441,507176,2015-01-30,5,"Thick, rich, moist, and the sour cream made it so yummy!  I&#039;ve never made a frosting like that, and I&#039;m definitely a fan. More cake/bread like than a traditional brownie texture. No walnuts, so I used pecans, excellent results that way as well.  Thanks for sharing, it was a good one!  Made a lot, so the remainder will be cut, wrapped in plastic wrap, bagged and frozen for a later treat."
2000137988,507176,2015-04-13,5,"This is my fourth time making these delicious brownies by request from friends &amp; family  members. Remember, the riper the banana the sweeter the brownie. Very moist and taste great with or without walnuts."
2000141599,507176,2015-04-14,5,"I too saw this on Facebook and I made them for a work function.  If you are a banana bread fanatic, you are going to love this.  I didn&#039;t have a &quot;jelly roll&quot; pan so I used a cookie pan of the same size that had 3/4inch sides.  This worked perfectly.  And because I knew my pan wasn&#039;t quite as deep as a jelly roll pan, I only used 3 bananas, but it was still fantastic.  
I made the icing while it was baking.. and only waited about 5 mins for the cake to cool.. because it said to ice it while warm... and you absolutely need to ice it while warm because the icing consistency is not like regular icing.  I will make this again and again"
2000247141,507176,2015-06-04,5,I just made this. Yummy!  I exchanged the vanilla in the frosting with bourbon and it is SO GOOD!  This recipe is a keeper!
126140,507176,2015-07-31,5,Love these bars.  Everyone thought they were delicious.  And the brown butter frosting is a perfect compliment.
2000426126,507176,2015-08-24,0,I have made these half a dozen times and only once did they turn out moist and dense like a brownie. All other times they turned out like banana bread. I&#039;m using the correct size pan and follow instructions to the &#039;T&#039;. What am I doing wrong?
2000833103,507176,2016-01-22,5,"This recipe is AWESOME! I made it with a few slight variations, and got some seriously delicious results. First, I made the &quot;brownies&quot; in a 9x13 cake pan, because I wanted them to be a bit thicker (if you do this, you MUST add on some extra bake time - I did about 10 minutes). I also halved the icing recipe (less surface area to cover...also I&#039;m not an icing girl, so a thinner coat is desirable to me). Finally, I chopped some extra walnuts and sprinkled them in the icing. I got rave reviews from everyone who tasted...even my tough to impress mother! Will definitely be making this again! YUM!!!"
2001091390,507176,2016-07-17,5,"These are INSANELY delicious! I found this recipe last year and have made them several times since, including just this afternoon- yum! I use chopped walnuts in the batter and toast another 1/2 cup to sprinkle on top. Go. Make them! :)"
2001179401,507176,2016-09-23,5,This is the best banana recipe I've ever found. Mine didn't turn out brownie like but the fluffest cake like and I added pumpkin spice instead of vanilla in the icing. It's amazing!!!
2001355566,507176,2017-01-17,5,Followed directions exactly with the exception of using a regular 9x13 cake pan and baked approximately 35 minutes. This was so good that everyone had it gone by day 3. It tastes even better the next day. Very yummy and a definite keeper.
10449415,507176,2017-05-19,5,"Delicious, easy, and not a lot of ingredients! I halted the recipe the first time since I only had two bananas and that made a nice 8x8 pan. Loved the moisture batter and easy icing."
2001986025,507176,2018-02-11,5,"best banana recipe..i always throw over ripe bananas in the freezer, and when i have 4 collected, i thaw them out and make this recipe.. changed it up a bit..although this recipe as is, is just perfect..i used self rising flour and skipped the salt and soda..(becuase i was out of all purpose..but still turned out perfect) and also used a 8x13 pan, and increased baking time...this time i added mini cho chips...the kiddos went crazy~!~!~! maybe someone else has noted this, i didn't read thru all the recipes but bon apetit"
227652,507176,2018-03-03,4,I made this for a neighbor and she really enjoyed it. I used about 4 small ripe bananas and baked for 30 minutes in a 13X9 pan. I threw it in the freezer for about an hour but it was still very moist so it really is more of a cake than a brownie. But still delicious. My neighbor said it was sweet enough w/o the frosting (I made a cream cheese frosting for her at the last minute)
2000847134,507176,2018-04-18,0,Shouldn’t they have chocolate if they are called BROWNIES?
2002165420,507176,2018-05-26,5,"so we changed a few things. First we substituted regular flour for Gluten free. we used glutino all purpose flour. I looked it up it read an even exchange which was easy. I didn't have all the powdered sugar I needed and I used some regular sugar. I lookedup the radio for that. it worked out fine. We're added on serving of apple sauce because gf flour tends to be very drying. I likemy calls, brownies really moist and not dry or cakey. I also use copper chef and because of the heat conduction cook times are quicker. so 20 minutes max or 15 for more gooey. We used Almond milk instead of regular milk. We opted to use the walnuts. good source of omegas!"
21758,12951,2001-10-22,5,I use this oil always
25656,12951,2001-12-08,5,"you can use this oil in foccacia bread and add alittle fresh basil too. it is superb on salad, or drizzled onto fresh bread."
244595,12951,2008-07-31,5,Sounds awesome!  How long will it keep?  Thinking it would make nice Christmas gifts.
915023,12951,2009-01-30,5,"So simple, yet so good! I made a batch using my summer basil and used it on salads all winter long. Great flavor!"
12657,25819,2002-06-02,4,"The combination of spinach and chickpeas is surprisingly good! Scaling down to 1 serving, I reduced the butter to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/8 tsp of black pepper. This was one simple dish to make, and it made for a great lunch with a banana and apple."
15492,25819,2002-06-17,4,"This is very close to one of my favorite recipies.Try throwing in some kufti (meat balls), serve over rice topped with yougert.  Mmmmmmmmmm"
165933,25819,2004-10-28,4,"This was terrific!  My daughter whole loves spinach dishes added 1T lemon juice and as with everything, sprinkled her feta cheese on top.  We ate most of it out of the pan ""testing it""!  Thanks for the recipe."
187987,25819,2007-03-14,5,"Awesome!Exotic flavors but easy to prepare.I added ground coriander seed as I thought it would go well,also sprinkled red pepper flakes as a garnish.Served with lemon rice.A quick and delicious vegetarian meal.Thanks for the idea."
184530,25819,2007-03-26,4,"This is a mild flavoured dish that allows the natural flavours of the spinach and chickpeas to shine through, so be sure to use the best of these you can find.  I used 300 grams of baby spinach leaves and everything else as listed, serving the finished dish on basmati rice.  Adding the juice of half a lemon greatly enhanced the flavour.  Next time I might try adding some extra spices and vine-ripened tomatoes."
268973,138406,2007-02-04,5,"Wow! This was a little tough to make, it was hard to keep the parmesan on the crackers while wrapping the bacon.  But it was so worth it!  The end result melts in your mouth, and is sooooo good, hot or cold.  Thank you!"
416738,138406,2007-09-17,2,"Eh...alright, but pretty heavy on the grease factor."
244852,138406,2007-12-17,5,I love this recipe!  I use Stater's bacon from the meat counter. It's thickly sliced. I don't understand why anybody would make a recipe with bacon and then call it greasy? Maybe the other reviewer should have cooked them longer? Recipe states....or until the bacon is done.
545507,138406,2007-12-20,5,I made this as an appetizer for my son's birthday party. The adults went crazy over them. They were so eassy to make and delicious!! I did the quick way - 40 minutes at 350 degrees and they turned out fantastic!!
531310,138406,2007-12-28,5,"These little appetizers are highly addicting!!!  I made these for guests on Christmas eve and they were demolished.  So easy to make, I just love these!!!"
14823,138406,2009-07-13,5,"I made this for my housewarming party today and they were fantastic. I used the low oven, 2 hour method and the crackers turned out perfectly. I served them at room temperature and was disappointed when there were no leftovers for me!"
526666,138406,2009-10-10,5,"These were wonderful. I used Club crackers and these were kinda crispy and crunchy, and we ate them warm! I'll certainly be making these again, and sharing them with my friends! Thanks for sharing, SweetSueAl. Made for Fall PAC '09."
464080,138406,2010-10-12,0,"These are one of our family favorites. I make them with Baked Ritz and small slices of cheese (instead of grating it). I also like to use thick, maple flavored bacon.  I cooked mine for 20 minutes at 375 and they were perfect!  UPDATE:  I made these again last night and used baked wheat thins and a raw gruyere which was fabulous.  Again, I baked them at 375 but for 15 minutes, then flipped them over and cooked them another 10 minutes."
383346,285162,2008-03-22,5,So simple and delicious.  I made this in my panini grill.  I'm wondering if it would good to add tomatoes in this.  Or other veggies.  Cause it's so good.  Or only cooked chicken with bacon.  Thanks Alison :)  Made for Newest Zaar tag.
618871,285162,2010-02-10,4,"I LOVE these!!! I actually love to take the cream cheese and bacon and some shredded chicken and maybe a spoon of sour cream and mix it all together in a bowl, then I can just spoon the mixture right onto the tortillas. DELICIOUS!!!"
6651,134575,2009-12-25,5,"Holy Cow is this cake good!  It's very very rich, but oh so delicious.  I recommend putting foil or a cookie sheet blow the baking pan to catch any overflow."
1138366,303979,2013-09-19,5,"Thanks so much Seabreeze! There is a long story for me with this Betty recipe.....I won&#039;t bore you! However, this is the rice pudding recipe you want if you want the more solid/dense type of pudding rather than the wet/creamy stove top type. Even my hubby who says he doesn&#039;t eat rice in pudding LOVED it......but he added I should have had whipped cream on it [didn&#039;t make it yet!]. I would add that any long cooking rice will work, and it&#039;s really not necessary to soak the raisins. Plus, if you goof like I did 40 years ago and forget to stir the pudding after it&#039;s baked 30 minutes as directed, the end result will be a layered custard on the top/rice on the bottom style.....but it was super good that way as well! Thanks again!"
2001286073,303979,2016-12-07,0,This is the rice pudding my dad used to make for us when we were kids back in the '60's. I'm very happy that I found it because I haven't had this type of rice pudding SINCE! Most people make it creamy/runny and/or no cinnamon.
724631,508538,2013-11-04,5,10 stars declared DH!  We used sweet potatoes because we had them on hand and these were perfect.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game.
226863,508538,2013-11-10,5,Perfect for Sunday Football!  Really enjoyed these delicious Potato Skins.  Made for PRMR tag game!  Thanks for sharing!
2597942,508538,2013-11-25,5,"What is not to love about classic potato skins?! I made these twice now... yesterday for hubby and I to munch on during football, and again today for lunch. This is how I normally make potato skins, except your way bumps the flavor way up. I never thought of brushing the skins with garlic butter. Genius! I brushed the insides and outsides. Yummy! I served these with sour cream and chives. Definitely making them this way from now on. Thanks for posting. (Made for PRMR)"
482933,508538,2014-02-03,5,Superb! Love the garlic butter and of course the cheese and bacon. Served with leftover sauce from recipe#165433.  Perfect football food. Thank you for posting.
130663,353171,2009-11-12,4,Loved it and will make again trying different fruits.
315565,353171,2009-12-21,4,This made a lovely dessert . I had to cook mine lots longerand that is I think due to my choice of fruits. I used a mango and it was so juicy that it affected cooking time - but it tasted just great. I will try with berries next time. I love the fact that the variations are endless so Loula -thank you so much.
463435,353171,2010-03-18,5,"I really loved the simplicity of this dish and found it to be a true comfort type dessert. Not to sweet, which is a plus. I topped mine with dried cherries which sank to the bottom of the pudding, and then I added slivered almonds.  The combination of the two went so well together. I will definitely make this again. Made and reviewed for the Feb.-March./Special Event 2010 Potluck Tag Game."
163112,353171,2011-01-04,5,Oh yeah!  This is called clafoutis in other places like my house.  ;)  I used frozen/thawed/drained cherries with complete success.  It cooked up perfectly in the time frame given at 350F.  I love this recipe......it's all gone.  Made for Veggie Swap 1/11.  xo Bethie
11297,353171,2011-07-12,4,I loved this served with dollops of whipped cream on a cold winters day.  I made mine with drained canned pears and slivered almonds which worked well.  I will be making this again using other fruits when in season.  Made for Aus/NZ swap June 2011
1016189,353171,2012-05-06,4,"This was super easy and quick -except for the baking time of course. I used a blender to mix the batter, poured it into the pan, and topped it with fresh blackberries. This was very good as is, but next time I make this I will add some vanilla and either add more sugar, use brown sugar instead of regular sugar, or a combo of both sugars to make it a bit sweeter and have more depth -me and my mom thought it needed these changes, but my dad and brother both thought it was fine. I wish I had taken a picture before cutting it because it turned out very pretty. Also make sure you put this in the oven while it is still warming up, as part of the cook time, because if you don't you will need to turn down the oven temp at the end to get the custard to set (I baked mine for 15 minutes longer than called for and then turned it down to 300*F for 7.5 minutes)."
402559,228323,2007-09-21,5,These were a hit at my daughter's first princess tea party. I did use chocolate chips instead of raisins though because she refuses to eat raisins. Thanks for a great idea!
153919,228323,2008-11-08,3,"These did not go over very well with the six-year-olds at my daughter's party.  The adults liked them better, however!"
4470,228323,2009-12-15,5,"Never mind the kids we loved them - I made them as a side  dish with our lunch salads. Used lite Garlic Herb cream cheese.  I would like these with black olives on them too or cranberries.  Thanks for posting this delightful tasty easy recipe
Made for P_A_R_T_Y_ 09"
60124,24017,2002-12-06,5,"The reason you probably are not getting many reviews bergy, is cause you didnt spell avocado right!!!   :)I had a hard time finding it again.
I made this tonite for husband and daughter to have with king prawns, steamed asparagus and boiled eggs.
I gave it 5 stars because it tasted wonderful, but I had to give it a kick along in the double boiler to thicken the egg mix, as it was still runny and tasted ""raw"", then I continued the recipe. This will take pride of place on the Xmas table, and I am going to try the other one you have for vegatables. thanks for a really good one "
298757,490280,2014-03-29,5,"One of my favorite memories of food at Grandma&#039;s as a kid.  Sweet, yummy, but light :)  Also, very easy and quick to make."
322548,251766,2007-09-12,5,"I totally loved this! I used a dsp of oil because I found that brushed on to the tortilla it was plenty. They were easy to make and cooked quickly but turn quickly so they need to be kept a close eye on. I made salt and black pepper flavour and can't wait to try others too, I found that seasoning before cooking resulted in a better flavour. The crisps themselves were crunchy yet soft as well despite looking like they were going to be overcooked. I don't think I'll ever buy a bag of trotilla chips again!"
73836,60938,2003-08-19,5,"These were really very,very good.  I did not fry the potato skins, however, I chose to shake them in a plastic bag with a little olive oil and seasonings, and then baked them at 230*C for about 20 minutes,until crispy,then added the toppings.  I also used low fat cheddar and instead of sour cream for dipping, I used low fat ranch dressing.  Overall a winner!!!"
469903,373481,2009-05-26,5,"My DS and I made this afternoon for a little snack. It was very easy to whip up and had great flavor! Since the brown sugar didn't seem to be melting in all places, I kicked it up to 400 for the last 5 minutes - perfectly done! DS wanted his over frozen yogurt (which promptly melted - the bubbles in the picture are actually the frozen yogurt) and I threw some unsweetened shredded coconut on top of mine. Made for ZWT5."
335614,373481,2009-05-29,5,"These are delicious. They have a lovely contrast of sweet creamy banana and piquant spice from the allspice. I ran out of lemons without realizing it, so I subbed some citrus flavored rum for the lemon juice. I had mine with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top, but they were just as good all by themselves."
96796,373481,2009-05-29,5,"How will I not eat this every day??  ;-)  I made this for ZWT5 Caribbean (and for the Caribbean Dessert challenge), and I absolutely loved the flavor.  I used to make a similar recipe on the stovetop, but this is so much easier and cooks while you eat dinner.  I always have these ingredients on hand, so this will be my new go-to dessert.  Thanks for a keeper!!!"
383346,373481,2009-06-04,5,These bananas are delicioius.  Thanks Luvcook :)  Made for the Saucy Senoritas of ZWT5
803511,373481,2009-06-04,5,These are fabulous!  Easy to throw together with stuff I usually have on hand!  Love it!  Had with some vanilla ice cream and chopped walnuts.  Made for ZWT5.
369715,373481,2009-06-11,5,Made for dessert and topped with vanilla ice cream. Everyone enjoyed these. Made as directed. Made for Family Picks ZWT5.
826110,373481,2009-06-15,3,This was OK.  It was kind of like eating baby food.  I had to add cinnamon to give it enough flavor for me.  My oldest daughter liked it though.
738401,168979,2010-02-08,5,"Very tasty.  I made this as stated a few times and we loved it.  I saw other recipes that used honey instead of brown sugar to sweeten the balsamic vinegar. I've added 1 tablespoon of butter on occasion after thickening.   I used this over beef or chicken and GREAT.  Thanks for posting, CutiePieHentai, I'll make this again."
69838,59771,2003-04-19,5,wow... this was magnificent..!!! Reminds me of the apple crisp my father makes :-) Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!
525142,59771,2008-03-10,5,"Great recipe for traditional apple crisp lovers!  I never made apple crisp but when my son-in-law that I adore told me how much he loved it when he was a kid, I had to find a good recipe!  This was awesome.  I used all cinnamon and squeezed some lemon juice on the apples and put a bit of vanilla over them before I added the topping.  YUUUUUUM!"
542159,458492,2011-10-09,4,This made a nice quick little snack that lacked depth so after two bites sprinkled on some cinnamon which added a nice layer. I made as written and include the drizzle of honey. Thanks for the post.
424680,458492,2011-10-22,5,"Did use a really ripe banana here & that gave it enough sweetness, I thought, so I left out the honey! However, I did take a hint from Debbwl & sprinkled on a little cinnamon & that really made it for me! Very nice! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this fall's round of Pick A Chef]"
137302,458492,2011-10-31,5,I was surprised that this was so tasty.  I have never liked the taste of regular scrambled eggs because in my opinion they have no flavor.  I was curious about this recipe as a result.  I didn't have any honey...so decided to taste it without any additions first.  I had a all yellow banana...since it was large I put about 3/4 of it into the scrambled egg mixture and cut the remainder in small chunks and added them after the egg/banana mixture was cooked.  I was surprised how good it tasted to me.  I'm sure that the addition of the cinnamon mentioned by others would enhance it even more.  But it tasted good enough without anything else to just eat the entire serving.  Thanks for something really different.  Almost has a dessert taste.  Made for PAC Fall 2011.
656678,458492,2012-04-10,5,This recipe was so good I had to join the website just to make a review!  Sooo yummy.  I don't tolerate raw bananas well so i'm always looking for recipes that aren't banana bread.  I used a drizzle of honey but i'm sure cinnamon would be wonderful too.  Thank you for the creative and delicious recipe :)
2309066,458492,2012-09-05,5,"Just made this tonight for dinner. SO GOOD! I used 1/2 cup egg whites, and one large banana which I mashed with a pastry blender, leaving some chunks, as well as cinnamon. I was originally planning on using some sugar-free syrup, but when I tasted how sweet this was, I didn't even bother!! Tastes EXACTLY like french toast!! Will make again and again!! <br/>Note, even with 1/2 cup egg whites (aprox = 2 whole eggs) the serving size is fairly small. Ok for a snack, but for a meal, you may want to use more, closer to 3-4 eggs (2/3 - 1 cup whites)"
2942962,458492,2013-08-13,5,"I found a recipe almost like this on my facebook as a banana pancake...tryed it , loved it...&lt;br/&gt;I did find that if you have a large banana do add 2 eggs or it just keeps falling apart. I have also made it with choped tomatoes and onion, scambled."
2001604168,458492,2017-06-28,5,Super good recipe so good. The portion of honey realy topped it of. i also made it like a pancake or crape and it tasted even better.
50969,318703,2009-09-20,4,"To start off, I have to tell you that I'm pleased to be the first to rate this recipe. :)This was made for mine and SO's dinner on 9/19/09.Since I was making baked beans and needed to fry up some bacon, I just used the "" bacon drippins "" to brown the smoked sausage in. The rest of the recipe was made as written. But I think if this is made again, I'm cutting the honey down to 1/8 th. cup since it seemed to be a bit on the sweet side. And the only pasta I had was bow tie and it worked just fine. Thanks for posting and, "" Keep Smiling :) """
930552,318703,2009-12-03,5,"This was very good! My husband usually does not like smoked sausage, but he really liked it like this. It was very easy to put together using ingredients I usually have on hand. I served appetizer style with toothpicks to make it more fun. Thank you, I will definitely make this again!"
808535,111362,2008-05-02,5,"Very delicious! I didn't put in any nutmeg or parsley because we didn't have either at home which made mine rather plain, but they turned out to make a great meal, combined with Sauerkraut (very typical). I made one mistake by peeling the potatoes before boiling them, I think that's probably why the dough was quite sticky. The result was *very* homemade looking Schupfnudeln, but that was quite ok for the family! I'll defnitely make this again!"
838461,111362,2008-11-30,4,"This was very good.
But you can eat them sweet,too.
I tried them once with thick Vanillin-sauce. My kids liked it.

But schupfen doesn't have to do with schubsen.... it means something to throw lightly. The Schupfnudeln are thrown lightly in the pan, when you fry them."
26041,24149,2002-06-08,5,"I made this before school all by myself, and I like it alot. Thank-uou for my cookbook, that was nice of you. I like to cook sometimes.

122993,24149,2006-10-06,5,Made this for a quick breakfast on a day we were running behind. Very good and so much easier to eat in the car than a bowl of cereal. ;)PAC Fall '06
51011,24149,2006-10-07,3,"This was pretty good when I was in a hurry one day last week, but I still prefer cooking the toast in the oven instead.  It was not bad, just different.  Thanks for sharing!"
93997,24149,2007-12-29,4,Very good. Easy and quick breakfast. Thank you!
744939,24149,2008-02-12,5,Had this for breakfast this morning.  It has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  Tastes just as good today as it did then too!  Thank you.
37636,24149,2008-05-01,5,"Just as it should be, without an overwhelming amount of sugar or cinnamon that I have seen on other recipes. This is one of those bare necessities recipes that everyone grows up on, a comfort food in the every sense of the word. Thanks for posting!"

98722,219233,2007-06-27,5,"A+ for sure!  I used the maple syrup, which was just perfect, neither too sweet nor too tart.  We used this on slices of pork loin, which we grilled and made sandwiches from.  They were just delicious.  Thanks for posting!"
723960,219233,2008-01-28,5,"This was great - took five minutes to prepare and after a few hours of marinating I grilled the chops in a Foreman grill. My boyfriend kept raving about how good they were, between mouthfuls!"
226242,219233,2008-07-28,5,"Absolutely wonderful!  I used this at Christmas, and forgot to write a review...  using it again tonight.  I don't think there is a better marinade out there, honestly.  THANKS soooo much for the recipe.  It RAWKS!  =)"

1154380,219233,2009-02-06,5,This was a great marindae.  I let it sit overnight and also I cooked the pork in the marinade covered the first 15 minutes and uncovered the last 15.

86512,258527,2009-04-16,5,These are great!! So easy to make too. It's cheap to make too because I always have the ingredients on hand. I would have never thought of bbq'ing green beans. I will be making these again. Thanks Jim for sharing your recipe Made for PAC Spring '09
204261,258527,2009-05-31,5,These are wonderful! My husband and I normally don't enjoy crunchy green beans as we were raised on the canned stuff. We both agreed though that these are wonderful! Thank you so much for a new recipe to use for fresh or frozen green beans.  Made for ZWT5.
369715,258527,2009-06-01,5,Made these as directed and we all enjoyed them. This was a nice change for us. We love green beans and this was a different way to enjoy them. Made for ZWT5.
296027,258527,2009-06-01,5,This is how my Dad regularly made green beans at home growing up (only his were completely stovetop in a cast iron)....so I couldn't resist making these for ZWT5!!  Thank you for posting a delicious recipe that reminded me of his.  Tres Magnifique!  **Made for ZWT5**
560491,258527,2011-03-19,5,Amazing!!  Made exactly as wriiten just halved the recipe and I wish I didn't!  We are these all and I could have eaten more.  I like the sweetness from the sauce and the saltiness from the bacon.  Will be made again!  Going into my best of cookbook.  Made for PAC Spring 2011.
383346,258527,2012-01-23,5,For the taste it's 5 stars.  But the green beans took longer to cook because I don't like them too crispy.  So next time I will steam them first and when ready add them to the remaining ingredients.  Thanks Maryland Jim :)  Made for the Best of 2011 tag game

1150638,344870,2009-02-02,4,"Mam, I'm speechless. Your bread pudding and this wonderful custard make a great combination. It's truly a warm experience. In fact it can make one forget a miserable day."
163687,344870,2011-01-10,5,Nummy!
2433986,344870,2012-10-14,0,"This is an easy recipe for really good custard.  I made it according to directions, and didn't even need to strain the egg mixture.  However, I'm not overly fond of vanilla, so I added some orange extract (about 3/4 teaspoon, to taste) that went really well with the amount of vanilla in it.  Definitely a recipe to hang on to.  This will go well with anything pumpkin for the holidays."
2510301,344870,2012-11-18,5,This was so good. I made some for my 2 year old and he ate 2 bowls. I recommend straining the eggs before you put them in and straining the custard before you chill it. Make sure u get the custard to pudding thickness while you are cooking it because it doesn't really thicken in the fridge. Such a yummy recipe
889287,344870,2013-01-04,5,Wow this is an easy fast recipe. Made it for our 25-mth old twin girls during Xmas holidays in Lebanon in my MIL's very basic kitchen. Reduced sugar to 2T and poured over sliced banana. Even my hubby was loving it :)
2646210,344870,2013-01-20,4,"This is good, but it's not custard. It's old-fashioned pudding. Custard is much different in consistency-- silkier -- no cornstarch to thicken it and is baked in a bain marie (a larger pan with hot water). If you are having trouble with this scorching in your pan, try using a double boiler."
2682280,344870,2013-02-07,0,"Gardenpoet is right, this is vanilla PUDDING...custard is baked in a double boiler in the oven for 50-60 minutes, if you try to pass this of as custard to a chef, they will laugh you out of the kitchen. Custard & CR?ME BR?L?E are closely related as they are both cooked the same way & time, & the recipe is similar while neither use thickening."
37636,344870,2013-02-08,0,"Just a comment in response to previous comments- this *is* custard. Custard is milk thickened with eggs. The cooking method doesn't matter- it can be baked or cooked on a stovetop. The consistency doesn't matter- custard can be thick and creamy or thin and pourable (like the custard ""creme anglaise""). It doesn't matter if it is cooked in a bain marie or not. Thickeners such as cornstarch are often added to custards as in recipes for pastry cream (such as go in eclairs). The *eggs* are what sets custards apart, and any good chef knows that, as a chef is supposed to know 100 ways to cook an egg, one for every pleat in the chef's hat. This *may* or *may not* be an outstanding recipe, but one thing is for sure: it's a custard recipe. But don't take my word for it. Look it up."
2803785,344870,2013-04-27,1,"If I were looking for a vanilla pudding, I would probably give this more stars.  This is not custard.  This does not look like or taste like custard.  When I follow a recipe for &quot;Basic Vanilla Custard&quot;, I expect to have custard at the end of the process, not pudding.  Since I wanted custard, I have wasted two eggs, two cups of milk, and all the rest of the ingredients."
1668270,344870,2013-09-07,5,"This recipe is what I always hoped vanilla custard would taste like, but it never quite hit the mark till now.  It came out so creamy and simple, and passing the eggs through a sieve first was a good idea to insure against any little stringy gummy bits. I&#039;m eating it right now, this one&#039;s a keeper! :)"
1800204540,344870,2013-11-07,5,"To those who say this recipe is a pudding and not a custard...I&#039;m sorry, you are incorrect. This recipe IS a custard, because it contains eggs. A pudding does not contain eggs. The combination of eggs and cornstarch (or flour) is a very common principle for pastry custards. The starch in the cornstarch or flour stabilizes the egg yolk to prevent curdling and preserving texture."
1801596484,344870,2013-12-30,0,"This turned out really well.  I added some rice from a takeout Chinese dinner to make it into rice pudding.  To my surprise it is delicious.  This is a very good basic pudding/custard!  My goodness, what is all the fuss about?  Just eat and enjoy!"
4353582,344870,2014-01-20,5,"this is the way english custard is made, this is a custard recipe as some one stated it old fashioned custard pudding, no its custard that thick stuff is pudding. I am glad to have a proper reciepe my mum was english and she never showed us how to make this. Since she has passed away I am very happy to have the correct recipe. I read the custard powder ingredients and its cornflour salt and vanilla, I would rather make it from scratch. thank you so much"
8053607,344870,2014-02-11,5,"Quick, easy and tasty.  I made 1/2 the recipe for oatmeal creme brulee.  Awesome."
1802607185,344870,2014-03-22,4,"This recipe is very easy to follow for a beginner, although I personally had problems with it the first time. I had the heat up too high and I kept ignoring it for too long so it came out lumpy, but it still tasted okay. My second and third attempts were much more successful. Tastes very good when stuffed into crepes or other pastries, but not so much on it&#039;s own."
1802636944,344870,2014-04-02,4,"Yummy.  It&#039;s custard in my books, but I&#039;m English, so what could I know about food...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I substituted 4 tbsp. flour for the cornstarch, added just a dash of vanilla, and threw in a little sprinkle of nutmeg and a cracked cardamom pod just after the eggs were stirred in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It turned out very tasty, but too sweet for me.  Next time I&#039;ll halve the sugar.  There WILL be a next time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great recipe, thank you!!"
1802661520,344870,2014-04-12,4,"I really enjoyed the ease of the custard recipe! The plain nature of the recipe lends itself well to modification (I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, 1tsp cardamom, 1tsp nutmeg, and 1tsp cinnamon to sweeten the deal). Best custard I have had in years!"
1802635612,344870,2014-04-12,1,"This is actually a pudding.  Custard is made with milk (and/or cream), egg yolks, sugar, spice.  The more yolks, the thicker it will be."
1802628263,344870,2014-04-25,5,Easy and delicious
1802686676,344870,2014-06-11,4,"My partner made this with no cooking experience and no trouble. It was a tasty, no fuss, quick custard to make. What I like about it is that it is made with milk alone, rather than half cream (I used skim milk); that it uses whole eggs instead of just egg yolks (less waste, less fuss); and that it isn&#039;t too sweet (next time will try with a natural sugar substitute). For guests or a special occasion you might want to try a richer, more complex custard (I agree with below poster that this is a custard not pudding - at least in Australian terminology... there are many types/ways of cooking custard), however, for a quick custard anyone can make, poured over poached pears on a cold winter night - this did the trick!"
1803062261,344870,2014-08-23,4,I just made this with my 6 year old daughter and it turned out lovely. We added 2.5 teaspoons of vanilla for extra taste. We served it straight away over some hot apple pies and it was delish!
1803096630,344870,2014-09-04,4,"I miss custard. Something I took for granted living in New Zealand was having either ready-made custard, or custard powder. This recipe is close, but not as thick (I guess you&#039;d have to cook it a little longer) and it&#039;s a bit sweeter. Don&#039;t get me wrong, this is a great recipe and I will make it again in the future, but I will use probably 1/3 less sugar next time and see how that comes out. Thanks for posting this recipe. It&#039;s pretty easy. The key for people who keep getting clumps is you have to treat it like gravy and stir quite frequently to ensure the starch doesn&#039;t stick to the bottom, or the milk burns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m keen to get a can of boysenberries and try some of this with that. It was one of my favorite yet infrequent desserts back home."
1803631995,344870,2015-01-08,0,"The confusion between what is or isn&#039;t custard has more to do  with terminology than to the recipe under discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the British and ex-pats living in the &#039;colonies&#039; custard is the stuff Birds and Harry Horne make - it&#039;s yellow, easy to make, kids love it, Mums love it because it gets extra milk into the kids and warms their little tummies on cold winter days, and it&#039;s ingredients are corn starch, tapioca starch, potato starch, salt, colour, artificial flavour, and arrowroot flour. It is poured over any pudding the cook deems will benefit by its addition - i.e. spotted dick, bread and butter pudding, steamed fruit, jam roly poly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, the English traditionally refer to what North Americans call dessert as &#039;pudding&#039;  which is whatever dish follows the entr&eacute;e - aside from cheese and biscuits (crackers to North Americans). So &#039;pudding;&#039; which means for North Americans a recipe that is similar to the packaged dessert sold as Instant Pudding doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that at all to the English and their relatives although most of us are flexible and tend to be &quot;mid-Atlantic&quot; in our usage. We tend to adopt Americanisms when in America - it seems the polite thing to do even if it was our language to begin with - and revert to our own language when at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, is this a custard recipe?  For those who understand my reference to Birds and Harry Horne, yes, it is.  For those who insist we are wrong, I suggest wider travel, greater tolerance for the views (and language) of others and a less dictatorial attitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comment that really stunned me though was the one suggesting using a double boiler in the oven.  I assume a ban marie was what was meant.  Most double boilers have handles that were never meant to see the inside of a hot oven and would be ruined if ever they did."
2334919,344870,2015-01-19,5,Very delicious!
2000114442,344870,2015-04-04,5,Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe. I was successful on my first attempt. My daughter and hubby loved it too.
2000132219,344870,2015-04-11,5,"Yum! I&#039;ve always been scared of making proper egg custard but this was so easy and worked really well, even with low fat milk (and no need to strain). Just the thing for a cool evening."
2000217479,344870,2015-05-21,5,"I highly recommend this custard. I use this recipe all the time now. It is wonderful and one of the best I have come across Thank you for sharing.

2000286437,344870,2015-06-21,5,"GREAT CUSTARD RECIPE ?? I did this for my husband on Father&#039;s Day and it was perfect. For years I have seen my all the women in my family make custards. I used Carnation Milk. I blended the ingredients together in my Nutri Blender, I used a double boiler, and I added a little cognac as well.  I drizzled over a chocolate cake . It was decadent. Smooth &amp; silky."
1794913,344870,2015-07-17,0,"Instead of fussing with beating the eggs, just use egg substitute, which is already homogenized -- and healthier"
2000415024,344870,2015-08-19,5,This is basically the base for my coconut cream pie.   I was looking for a quick no bake custard to make my Whovian daughter that wanted fish fingers and custard.   This was a big hit.   She loved it! (Alton Brown has a great recipe for the fish fingers).  This will be a repeat!  Thanks
2000384392,344870,2016-01-24,4,"Easy recipe, very tasty. Definitely more of a thin custard, like pudding. Would be good drizzled over sliced cake or waffles. I was looking for something to &quot;plop&quot; onto cherry pie-tarts but this isn&#039;t thick enough. I still sat there and ate a bowl of it on it&#039;s own ;)"
1802849661,344870,2016-02-02,5,Yummy! Super easy to make and tastes amazing. A great basic vanilla recipe. I&#039;ll definitely be bookmarking this to make again!
2000866963,344870,2016-02-09,5,"Just made this I think it is delicious, I made a cake recipe my Mum gave me and poured some of the vanilla custard on a slice, OMGoodness I thought I was in heaven with her."
2000968302,344870,2016-04-11,4,As simple as it is concise and exactly what I was looking for. Good recipe!
2001202376,344870,2016-10-25,5,"DISCLAIMER: I adapted this to make a sugar free custard for my hypoglycaemic husband, and, despite my error, it turned out really well! I replaced the sugar with 1.5x Splenda, added a dash of nutmeg and replaced about 1/3-1/2 of the milk with cream (just because I had some and it needed using up, which probably helped), and it worked very well. I also threw in a bit more cornstarch because I thought I had over stirred it. The end result was a light, creamy custard that was half eaten before it had even had a chance to finish cooling. Using the whole egg is also a bonus; my other half is happy to eat the extra protein and I am just happy to not be left with extra egg whites. I can always turn them into sugar free meringues but I tend to forget them..."
2001317058,344870,2016-12-23,4,This is the perfect pouring custard for desserts like pies and puddings. There are 2 kinds of custard; the type thickened with eggs and the type thickened with cornstarch. The kind of custard thickened with several eggs and baked in a water bath in the oven is solid dessert and not intended to be poured on things like puddings. That's the main difference.
1800043596,344870,2016-12-27,0,"I thought only egg yolks were used, haven't made a custard in awhile, couldn't quickly locate the recipe used in the past and thought I could get a replication online. Of all the recipes reviewed, some seemed really crazy, this one is the closest to what I remember except the entire egg, only ever remember using the yolk of the egg."
2001441949,344870,2017-03-18,0,This is delicious and the easiest custard I've made. I followed the suggestion of a previous poster and used four tablespoons of flour instead of cornstarch (mostly because I was out of cornstarch!) and added some nutmeg and cardamom. I did pass it through a sieve to eliminate any inconsistencies in the texture. It's perfect!
2001456219,344870,2017-03-26,1,"Not good. Not worth making. Box or store bought cozy shack pudding is way better. Sorry. I really wanted it to be good..nice easy recipe. The taste is not very good, and the consistency is bad, it's weird. If I take the trouble to cook, I want it to be better than the store..homemade deelish! A creme brulee recipe I made once was out of this world."
2000772732,344870,2017-04-03,4,Great. Making it for the second time. Yummy. I added some banana slices to the bottom of small mason jars and poured the custard on top. And spinkled cinnamon and nutmeg. Everyone enjoyed it!
2001544855,344870,2017-05-19,0,"Made it, hubby delirious with joy. Loved how easy it was. Made in small mason jars, easy to stack in the fridge. Going to make again today but add bananas on the bottom, sounds yummy."
2001563078,344870,2017-05-31,5,"I have made this recipe several times and it turns out perfectly! I do use 4 egg yolks rather than 2 whole eggs. That being said, there is a technique to making custard, and if you don't do it correctly, it will not turn out right. Not sure why the negative reviews on this recipe, because it's the perfect, simple custard. :)"
2001566499,344870,2017-06-03,5,"Love this custard recipe with banana, so good, I did cut the sugar down to 2T though coz it was a bit sweet for me. A great recipe all the same. Oh and definitely custard"
2001567866,344870,2017-06-04,5,One word. Amazing!!!
2001198340,344870,2017-08-23,5,"Thank you Miss_Amy for sharing this recipe. My husband loves it. He just wants me to cut back on the amount of sugar, just a personal preference. It was simple, thank goodness."
2001687941,344870,2017-08-26,0,"If you are in a hurry, just whisk all ingredients together (except vanilla) and start over medium heat. When thickened, I add the vanilla and also 2 T of butter for an additional creamy flavor."
2001843745,344870,2017-12-07,2,"Using an untweaked version of this recipe, the custard ALWAYS burned. I tried it multiple times, but the only way to prevent it is to switch pots halfway through. Additonally, the custard tastes quite mediocre the way it's made in this recipe."
2001895240,344870,2017-12-28,4,"Thanks for this, though I haven't tried it yet. My mother used to make a very similar custard that was my father's favorite dessert, served warm. She gave me the recipe many years ago and I lost it, but this sounds like the right ingredients and proportions."
2001896891,344870,2017-12-29,5,"Turned out very well. No need to change pots -- heavy bottomed psn, no problems with mixing following instructions and no streaks of egg white. I made double portions and have already eaten half! Next time, I shall reduce the amount of sugar a titch as I prefer something less sweet and infuse the milk with vanilla bean instead of using vanilla extract."
2001520005,344870,2018-01-27,0,"It turned out PERFECT and was so easy to do, thank you.....reading though should use butter too?"
2001841768,344870,2018-01-31,5,SO GOOD! Might decrease the sugar a bit next time just because I usually roll that way but it was absolutely delicious and so so easy!
2001999644,344870,2018-02-19,5,Quick and easy. Kids loved it poured over Frozen strawberries and left to set in the fridge.
2002090807,344870,2018-04-01,5,"Used 4 egg yolks instead of 2 whole eggs. Silky smooth, yummy and best of all - my 1 year old loved it! Thank you!"
2002158426,344870,2018-05-20,5,"Turned out excellent. Followed recipe exactly, except I added 2T of real butter as it was thickening &amp; a dash of nutmeg. I poured it into 6 little mason jars and let it set up in the fridge. Tasted while warm and did not get the full flavor, I actually considered adding more vanilla but did not, after it had set the flavor was perfect, no need for straining. Very quick, easy, &amp; tasty. ??"
2002168519,344870,2018-05-29,5,"This is an easy, quick and inexpensive alternative to the boxes of Jello pudding sold in the US. I used it first when I wanted to make a rice pudding, but was with the previously mentioned box. I tried it and everyone loved it. Thickened quickly, and is delicious warm or cold. Over time, I have learned to alter the sugar depending on what type of fruit I use. Strawberries, a little less. Peaches, a little more. The best custard recipe I have ever tried."
2002344762,344870,2018-11-22,0,"I learned not to let it boil or uou will get scrambled eggs I used pure vanilla,vit D milk,fresh cornstarch and stirred most the time cooking.I stopped stirring to see the bubbles form.This is an excellent recipe.Make fresh caramel to coat the bottom of your bowl.My kick like pom creme brule!"

141147,11361,2004-05-13,1,seems a good idea but it didnt make a good meal and was very fatty
51011,11361,2004-06-09,5,"I have a secret- I can not make a meatball to save my life.  I found this recipe and decided to try it out.  What great results.  I addded half this to a container of spagetti sauce I was freezing for later, and used the rest to make meatball subs. Yummy and so easy! This is so versitile and could be used in many different dishes.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
23651,11361,2004-08-26,5,"I have done this for years, especially with the Italian sausages.  It's fabulous.  It's easy to lay them on a papertowel to drain the fat off.  The add them to any dish.  Great idea.  Thanks for posting it."
353465,242806,2009-12-11,5,"I had to try this recipe just for its 25 steps. I followed it to the letter and HAVE to give it a 5+ for the end result. It was GREAT! I made this for my wife because she can not eat any nut but almonds. This being Christmas season I had to come up with a good one, this was it and I have to tell you, I ate most of it. hehhehe Vicki loved it too !!! Lota work but worth it. Thanks.."
8688,174217,2006-09-12,4,"This is a most pleasant combination of flavors.  I always have these ingredients on hand, so I am sure I will be making this often!  Thanks for this wonderful new drink idea, Evelyn!"
58104,174217,2006-09-13,5,Cool refreshing and tangy! I added a couple frozen cranberries as a garnish!
56112,174217,2006-09-24,5,"A delightful tangy mocktail.  Made exactly as directed.  Wonderful drink to serve when you want something good but non alcoholic. Didn't have an orange for garnish, but the drink is very attractive without any type of garnishment."
124249,174217,2007-01-18,5,"As far as beverages go this is a 5 star in my book. I served it with breakfast a nice change from having plain orange juice. Will certainly make again.

Thanks evelyn/athens

179133,174217,2008-04-29,5,Yummy! I had fresh squeezed orange juice left from another recipe and also happened to have cranberry juice & ginger ale so this was the perfect recipe! Thanks!
201581,174217,2010-07-08,5,"Made with lite cranberry juice, regular orange juice, and diet Vernors ginger ale. Garnished with a maraschino cherry for a real party mood with breakfast LOL! Thanks for posting evelyn! Made for When It's Hot Tag Game."
76389,62367,2003-05-28,4,"Three out of five of us enjoyed it!  I did add a little bacon that I had left over, added garlic as well, which added a nice flavor.  Next time I will use more than leftover bacon, maybe 1/2 a pound for the next time I make it.

Very good with a side salad.

Laura"
28604,62367,2003-10-29,4,"I finally had time to try something new today, and I chose this! It was very easy to make and, although I did have to change a couple things, it turned out great! I followed Laura Dawn's advice by adding some minced garlic to the meat and tomato soup mixture. I had to use Bow Tie pasta (12 oz box)- it was all we had! A last minute addition I made was about 1/4 to 1/3 cup's worth of frozen corn added to the meat mixture. I wanted to get a veggie in it so it wouldn't appear so plain. Everyone loved it, I did sprinkle some paprika on the top. No leftovers, it fed 5 people. (I had the most!) Thank you very much for sharing! I was a nice change! "
625884,62367,2007-10-24,3,"We added cheese to the top - my boys enjoyed it, but I found it a little bland.  Next timr I make it we'll see what we can do to tweak it."
403665,193053,2007-01-08,4,"Really tasty! I actually chopped up some boneless chicken breast I had and threw it in with the rest of the ingredients! There was enough for 4 servings, but my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing! Thanks for the great recipe!"
877478,306739,2008-06-30,0,"I did not have any success with this recipe. It was very ""Mushy"". Maybe better directions would help???"
451055,150765,2008-11-20,5,"I was a bit skeptical about these, but they were delish.  They came out just fine, but for my oven, I'll need to tweek it a bit.  My family likes their bacon pretty done, so depending on how thick it is, you may need to cook it a little longer.  I think we will scramble the eggs with some cheese and chives next time.  This time we topped them with a bit of gouda/pepper cheese and that was great.  This will be fun for serving large crowds an elegant looking meal.  Thanks for a fun recipe.
Update:  Next time I will use the following recipe for oven cooked bacon Recipe #208501 and only cook it partially.  Then I will use this bacon to wrap inside the muffin tins.  Think this will make the bacon crispier."
174096,150765,2010-04-10,5,"Easy, delicious, and such a cute presentation!  I omitted the salt (personal preference).  Thanks for sharing!"
236760,150765,2006-01-16,5,Wow!  I always wanted this recipe.  My mom used to make them for us when I was little!  Oh wait.....you are my Mom!  Hee Hee.  I pre-cooked my bacon in the microwave instead in the frying pan.  Another shortcut is to use the Oscar Meyer Ready to Serve Bacon.
55690,150765,2006-08-20,5,"I love this recipe!  I partially cooked the bacon in the microwave, proceeded with the recipe.  Took them out of the oven, topped them with cheddar cheese and put them back in the over for a few minutes just to melt.  AWESOME!  Plus, they look great on a plate with hash browns, grits and biscuits!!!"
70073,150765,2006-10-17,5,"Love bacon and eggs and this recipe is simple and delicious. Scaled the recipe down to four slices bacon and four eggs for the two of us, and basted them with water as suggested because I like the top of my egg cooked. Served them with home fries (I love potatoes), thick sliced bread toasted and sliced tomatoes. Thanks for posting. :) Burnice"
345142,150765,2007-04-22,5,I made this for my husband and served it as part of breakfast in bed to thank him for the wonderful surprise birthday party that he and his daughter made for me. Thanks for a simple yet lovely and super easy treat.
189616,150765,2007-07-31,5,"Delicious, I used ready to serve bacon, tastes great cold too!"

41578,150765,2007-09-24,5,"These are not only very good, but a fun way to serve breakfast.  I also melted some cheddar cheese over the top because I had some to use up (but it isn't necessary).  Great recipe, Montana Heart Song!"
17803,150765,2007-09-26,5,This was great!  I made the bacon for these the night before. I only made 6 of these but I also made 6 of Recipe #150764.  So I made Recipe #150764 first to step 8.  Pulled the pan out of the oven after 5 minutes and finished both recipes.  I'll be making these for DD and friends for breakfast after Prom this spring.  Made for *PAC Fall 2007* game
570795,150765,2007-09-30,5,So simple and easy to make and soo good. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this quite often.
1877213,150765,2011-04-07,5,"My Dad used to make baked eggs like this.  He passed away a few years ago and I had forgotten about them until I saw your recipe.  They are fantastic and very nostalgic for me.  I baked them for 15 minutes, but will try 12 minutes next.  We always had them with the yolks still a little soft.  Thanks for all the happy memories!"
1802849661,150765,2015-03-03,4,These were so easy and delicious. What is better than eggs and bacon of a morning? Perfect for on the go breakfast&#039;s when you don&#039;t have time to make bacon and eggs!
2000115541,150765,2015-04-04,5,"So easy!  Cook the bacon ahead of time according to the recipe, especially if you are preparing several.  That is what makes it a time saver. You can add different things to them also. Finely (or not) chopped tomatoes, peppers, scallions, mushrooms etc.   A little bit of grated cheese on top. Pepper only, if desired, as the salt from the bacon makes it salty to begin with."

I soaked it for days, used soap, a normal sponge and a brillo pad and still egg was stuck on the muffin tin. Had to throw it in the trash. Totally not worth a new muffin tin. If I ever make them again ill have to use cupcake liners and mind you I greased that pan A LOT and it still was a horribly stuck mess."

383346,436590,2010-09-13,5,These potatoes are wonderful.  I made half recipe for 4 serving.  But we had just enough for 3 and my son doesn't eat a lot.

27643,33500,2002-11-11,4,"Bergy, these were so good! I did them in the broiler. I used 1/4 t of the cumin. Pineapple slices were sweet, tart, spicy, a great mixture. The honey mustard gave it a good contrast. I will definitely have these again! Thanks Bergy."
1783373,466948,2014-05-25,4,"I love fish and this one was pleasing.  The market in my area didn&#039;t carry orange roughy, so I used cod loin which was on sale.  The lemon/butter mixture sure did add great flavor.  Though I did like the barbecue chip flavor, it did taste like chips on fish.  Found that it is a great idea to use it along with more ingredients as a fish stuffing to round-out the flavors.  I&#039;m  going to use this idea again as it is a great way to pump up some great flavors.  Thank you weekend cooker for sharing.  Tagged it for PRMR."

We were all very pleased, and this is a keeper."
522505,150804,2008-03-07,5,"I thought this was pretty good. I think I added a bit more sour cream, so I came out with something a little different, but still good. My boyfriend said he liked the dish better the next day. I'm sure I'll come back to this recipe to try && make it the way you stated."
311003,475858,2012-07-06,4,"These were a delicious change from our standard ""plain"" popovers.  I loved the cheddar cheese flavor and the scallions.  Even though I'm a bacon addict, the pieces I crumbled seemed a little big and gave the soft, gooey interior a bit of crunch.  I don't prefer that in a popover, so next time I'm going to crumble up the bacon very finely before adding it.  And I might just add in the tiniest pinch of cayenne pepper.  Thanks for posting this great variation of a traditional popover recipe!"
26075,71856,2003-12-20,5,"I dislike mayonnaise but often use sour cream as a substitute to make recipes that call for it, so I thought I would try it with this.  It was great on my tomato salad.  I will use it on Taco Salads with the sour cream substitute.  Yum.
My family liked it even though none of them care for avocados."
53959,71856,2005-12-28,4,This was good but ours was too thick to use as salad dressing. We wound up using it as a dip instead. 
289319,71856,2007-10-21,3,This was good.  Had a little too much chili powder for me.  I also had to add a little water to thin it enough for salad.  The only thing different for me was I accidentally used lime juice instead of lemon.  Will make a again.
320216,71856,2009-03-11,0,"Excellent! A house standard now. I halved the mayo and subbed an equal amount of sour cream, added 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard, chopped fresh cilantro and substituted roasted garlic for the powder and used the whole thing as a base. Just add 2 tbsp to a very basic wine vinegar, olive oil vinaigrette. the base does make an excellent dip for raw veggies. baked pita wedges or seafood dippers. Much better with squid than tzatziki since I hate cucumbers."
394085,330036,2008-10-19,0,"There are elements of this that I love and some that are discordant, so I am not noting stars this time.  Although rosemary is my favorite herb, I learned here that I don't like it with eggs.  The addition of walnuts is brilliant...just wonderful.  I would have preferred my potatoes more thinly sliced than I had them (which was about 3/8 of an inch).  The major issue I had was uncertainty about the pan size.  The amount of vegetables prompted me to use a baking dish about 10x10 inches and the 4 eggs (plus cream and cheese) didn't come close to the top...neither did 6 eggs.  I do plan to make this again, with some adjustments."
251917,330036,2009-07-16,5,NEWEST TAG GAME: Sorry this is so late!! This was delicious!! I only changed the nuts - used pine nuts - it was out of this world!!
136997,421368,2010-04-25,5,Very nice recipe. I halved the amounts. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag game. :)
296050,225329,2007-07-02,5,These were excellent - the bacon gives a very nice flavor to the asparagus.  I've never had asparagus roasted in the oven before - so simple to make as well.  Will most definitely be having this again.
1711061,225329,2011-05-16,5,Awesome side dish.  I served it with New York strips and mashed potatoes.  Even the ones that were not big asparagus eaters ate it up (including my seven year old)!  I added a small amount of shredded Italian Cheeses under the bacon.  Thanks for sharing.
424680,403157,2010-01-19,5,I intended to make this recipe as written but got carried away this first time around & added a cup of raisins along with a bit of cinnamon ~ ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! Another time I want to use some whole wheat flour & try a couple of other things ~ Might even try the recipe exactly as written! Thanks for sharing a great keeper!

6381,31988,2002-07-03,4,"I have made this particular recipe for years. I am Italian, and my Mom made this. We all love it. I like it with spinach or swiss chard.  DELICIOUS!!!"
28077,31988,2002-08-29,5,This has been a main stay in my Italian family for years. We use swiss chard instead of the lettuce and we add some hot Italian sausage and a little tomato sauce. We also use precooked potato cut in chunks when we don't have white beans.It is wonderful when spiced up with extra red pepper flakes. My grandmother always called it Minestra.
55729,31988,2002-09-24,5,"This gets major brownie points for being the only greens recipe my kids have ever eaten! It was great! I used Great Northern beans, & the romaine of the original recipe. One caveat - my kids tried to give this 4 stars because they said it had too much pepper, but I think the problem was mine. I forgot the salt & pepper until I had put the greens in the pot, so I think some pieces of lettuce wound up with whopping amounts of pepper stuck to them. Next time I will have to stir it in *before* I put the greens in. Oops! I also have to note that I used 2 c. water & a Knorr chicken bouillon cube."
24386,31988,2002-12-04,5,"This is a great recipe!  I used escarole for the greens and left out the onion because that is how I am used to making this dish. I will definitely make this again, but with broth as an ingredient, I don't think the extra salt is necessary so I will omit that also. Absolutely awesome recipe!"
10896,31988,2002-12-27,5,This is simple and elegant served with fresh french bread. I had to throw together a meal for some out of town guests and they raved about it.
23479,31988,2003-01-25,5,"Really good, filling soup. We were so surprised by the taste with the romaine lettuce, but we will probably try it with spinach next time. Thanks for sharing!"
74059,31988,2003-06-04,0,"zoyie,
Wonderful Recipe! Fixed it with the
romaine. Can't wait to have again.
"
15892,31988,2003-06-04,4,Yummy!  I added a splash of white wine near the end to give it some punch.  I'll make this again.
151612,31988,2004-07-11,4,Great recipe.  Being Italian I have been making this for quite some time.  For a change with a zing use Escarole and Curly Endive.  Also add 1 link of sweet Italain sausage cut into pieces and 1 hunk of Peppeorini cut into cubes.  Enjoy!!!!
80064,31988,2004-11-21,5,"When I first started cooking this, my fiance was like, ""Ew, this looked gross.""   But, then he tasted it, and loved it!  (showed him)   Never cooked romaine lettuce before- thanks!"
210357,31988,2007-09-25,5,"Oh. My. Gosh.  This was so simple and delicious.  I used up a bunch of nearly-expired romaine lettuce purchased a few weeks ago.  The colors of this dish are striking, with the white of the beans, the gold of the broth, and the deep green of the lettuce.  It tastes even better than it looks, and it's a very filling side dish, which pleasantly surprised me.    The only thing I would change is to chop the lettuce leaves into quarters.  They were a bit unwieldy for me, and I cut them in half as I ate.  I used no extra salt or pepper, and no cheese either.  I could very well eat this as a meal in itself.  THank you for sharing an excellent recipe!"
399711,31988,2008-11-12,5,This was a big hit especially with my husband and son. I used veggie broth and cannelini beans (white kidney).
1552780,31988,2010-02-14,5,"Great Recipe - Tasted great, quick to make, and I'm a beginner! ;)

THANK YOU!"
308049,31988,2010-03-27,5,"So easy, delicious & healthy! The entire family ate it up! Thank you!!"
1556323,31988,2010-09-26,5,Wow! My 3 year old just ate beans and spinach! This recipe was delicious and so simple. I used spinach instead of romaine; and I served it with toasted cheesy bread. The only complaint I have is it was a little too salty even though I didn't add any salt. But I can fix that using no salt beans. This can be a meatless dinner or a side dish. We loved it. Thanks for sharing.
735753,31988,2011-02-13,5,"I've been making this for awhile as an easy low cal, meatless meal. My changes are that I use collard greens, sub in 1/2 cup white wine for some of the broth, add some red pepper flakes at the beginning and cook a LOT longer than 20 minutes. I like the greens really mushy. I'll even add some extra broth and cook for awhile with the lid off to reduce the broth even more and get more yummy flavor!"
85018,31988,2011-11-28,5,"Sorry I forgot to review this recipe.  Beans and greens are a real western NY, Italian treat!  We usually add some precooked sweet sausage and a little bit(1/2 to 3/4C ) of marinara sauce.  Love using the romaine.  This is a great budget meal that stretches and stretches!"
647495,31988,2012-03-10,5,"I use Kale and it worked GREAT!  I am trying to eat more healthy and this is 100% approved by the family!  It is good for you, easy to make, and tasts great.  What more can you ask for?"
1271506,31988,2012-05-02,5,"We lived outside of the very-Italian city of Utica, New York, for 5 years, where we were introduced to this classic dish.  In Utica, it was always made with escarole; however, it *is* delicious (and less expensive) made with Romaine!  Per your options, I added maybe 1/2 a tablespoon of tomato paste and a heaping half-teaspoon of red pepper flakes:  perfect!  Thanks for sharing."
2894019,31988,2013-07-08,5,"This is super easy, which I like, and it&#039;s super delicious! It&#039;s also very easy to put your own spin on it, by adding sausage or changing the type of greens. Also, adjust the salt and pepper to taste. Was looking for a simple and healthy meal for my &quot;meat &amp; potatoes&quot; husband and myself. This fit the bill perfectly! I work 6 days a week, so I like recipes that are simple without complicated ingredients &amp; procedures. Could not ask for a better one dish meal!"
669600,189887,2007-11-29,0,I tried this for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it.  The extra good part was it was super easy to make. After such a heavy meal as thanksgiving it's great to have.  Thank you so much for posting this.
143721,307241,2008-06-22,4,"Made this for ZWT4.  We thought it needed some salt.  Had it on mini-bagels, but I think it may work well on baked potatoes."
186855,307241,2008-12-09,5,"This butter is simply *perfect*. Love the flavour. We had it on three cheese tortellini, which was just heavenly. This would make canned or frozen vegetables spectacular too. Being the end of November, I used basil leaves that I had frozen. Just let them rest on paper towels to absorb any moisture before processing. I also used red peppercorns. We'll be keeping a supply of this in the fridge all the time. Made for the 12 Days of Christmas Recipe Swap. Update Dec 9/08 - Just can't leave this stuff alone. Had it tonight with corn on the cob. Heaven!"
197023,307241,2009-01-31,5,"WOW! :) Fabulously flavoursome, SO easy to prepare and an absolute must-try recipe if you love garlic and basil.  Since we have a healthy little basil plant at the moment, I made a double quantity, which we've enjoyed so far on BLT sandwiches and in mashed potatoes.  I'm looking forward to also using it on pasta.  Like Diana #2, I'll be making this regularly to have in the fridge for use at all times.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, Lynn.  Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders."
461724,307241,2010-01-18,5,Love this!  Now I know what I'll do when I have an abundance of fresh basil.  Didn't have any fresh garlic in the house so I used a teaspoon of garlic powder instead.  Thanks for posting!
383346,307241,2010-10-18,5,This is so yummy.  I made half the recipe for the 2 of us.  I toasted some bread and put this butter on it and put it back to broil a few minutes.  It was so good.  And we still have leftover for the next days :)  Thanks Lavender Lynn :)  Made for PRMR tag game
172169,326385,2008-09-22,5,"Lovely flavors. Was out of maple syrup, so used some honey instead, and it worked great.

You are right about this dish being a hit with the kids, as compared to plain apples.

Thanks and cheerio!"
464080,326385,2009-02-19,4,A nice and healthy evening snack for us as we diet.  I cut my apples in half to core them more easily (with a melon baller).  Mine were cooked perfectly after 30 minutes.  I used dried cherries which I highly recommend.  THANKS!  Made for AUS/NZ recipe swap.
1803684521,326385,2016-04-05,5,"Wonderful! Such an easy and healthy dessert! I wasn&#039;t sure what type of apple to use, but I had Golden Delicious so I used that and it turned out great!"
369715,149124,2007-08-23,3,These had a good flavor to them but they needed more cheddar and bacon. I didn't think they had much of a bacon or cheddar taste to them.
75497,149124,2007-03-05,5,"Wonderful!  I cooked my thick-cut peppered bacon this way: Recipe #173076 , and I served the burgers with Recipe #42564.  DH and I both loved these burgers!  I think next time I'll add some sauted mushrooms and onions, then they really could pass for a gourment burger from a local restaurant.  I think the peppered bacon I used added a great smokey flavor.  I don't make hamburgers too often, but I'll be keeping this recipe for the next time we want to indulge in bad-for-us treat!  :)"
420929,149124,2007-06-19,5,"Very good...I will add more cheddar cheese & bacon next time, I think I was afraid it was going to drip out!  It was a fantastic dinner with fried onion strings & cherry limeade.  I'll be making these again and experimenting with the insides!"
29782,149124,2009-07-21,5,"Very tasty burger, flavor was good. I too, believe that it would be good to use more of the cheese inside the burger. I used my George Foreman grill for this recipe. I didn't want to stand outside in the hot sun to grill today. Worked out fine and there was no mess to clean.
Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!"
1052065,149124,2010-04-14,5,Very good burger. The cheddar and bacon did not over power the burger but gave it enough flavor so you didn't need to add to it. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing Kaarin!
140132,149124,2010-06-09,4,"These were good.  I will make again, my family enjoyed them very much.  Next time I will use sliced cheddar instead of shredded so the cheese will ooze out of the burger with each bite.  Thank you for sharing this great summertime treat."
41529,17244,2002-05-25,4,"It was yummy but you might want to specify between green and red apples, I used green and it was a little too much of a taste clash for me, so I assumed you meant red. I liked the sandwich, but liked it even more because it became the basis for a recipe of my own. Thanks, and mmmm"
115525,17244,2006-01-29,4,This was a nice lunch.  I liked the creaminess of the cream cheese on a sandwich.  This would be easy to vary to your tastes.
80998,17244,2007-09-29,5,I really enjoyed this sandwich.  It was tasty and healthy.  Thanks for a great one that I am sure I will make often.
474993,17244,2007-09-30,4,"This was really yummy! I used homemade whole wheat bread, 2 tbsp of cream cheese, 1/4 apple, a couple of raisins and a slice of  cheese instead. Thanks for a great pick-me-up! ;)"
537188,17244,2008-04-08,4,This sandwich made a lovely lunch. I didn't have any cream cheese so I used soft goat cheese instead.
41529,18766,2002-05-27,4,"Oh yum! This was great. My only problem was that I used Potato bread and ended up burning the bottom a little (but it was still delicious!), so my suggestion for white bread users is: follow the instructions above, and when the bottom is brown take the sandwich off and if the bananas are still intact, microwave for a couple of secs. :) Delicious! 2 thumbs up"
104295,18766,2004-06-28,5,"I was, frankly, surprised by how much I enjoyed this.  When you push the bananas down into the bread like that they break up just a tad and get all warm and creamy.  Along with the crunchy wheat bread this is excellent and very healthy!  Thanks!"
138047,18766,2004-06-30,5,"I've been doing this for years but not in a griddle. Thanks for the idea!  I've always put it in the sandwich toaster, with some brown sugar sprinkled on top of the bananas and cinnamon.  My kids love it!!"
27395,18766,2005-07-03,5,"This was REALLY YUMMY! I kind of combined this recipe with my Cottage Cheese Banana Breakfast Delight #17475 by adding cottage cheese and sugar substitute to the top after letting this cool just a bit. Thanks for a great new (and healthy) breakfast idea!
~Manda"
230258,18766,2006-04-12,5,"Fantastic!! This was really simple but delcious! I really like the way you prepare this. I almost just sliced the bananas and put cinnamon on them but then i ran back to my computer and I read the directions(not just the ingridents this time!)
Thanks for the recipe!"
227652,18766,2007-06-14,5,"So yummy!! I usually toast the bread, sprinkle with cinn/Splenda & cut up a banana to go on top, but this brought it to a whole new level. The bread was nice & crispy, the banana was warm & sweet-can't say enough good things about it. Came together in a snap, too. Thank u for the good directions, too-always helps!"
308765,18766,2008-01-01,4,"Good diabetic breakfast element for DH, we just learned he is diabetic a week ago. Thanks."
556453,18766,2008-01-11,4,"When I don't know what to have for breakfast, this is what I have!  With some milky Chai tea, it makes a pretty satisfying meal.  I usually shove a whole small banana on there...love bananas.  If I need it done quicker than quick, I just use the toaster oven and smoosh the banana into the bread with the side of my knife.  Yum."
17803,18766,2009-05-11,4,"This is an easy and fast snack to make.  It may also have health benefits, as it may improve blood glucose and cholesterol levels in people with Type 2 diabetes.  So I always give my cinnamon container an extra shake on my food.

832887,18766,2013-02-18,5,"What a treat!. This is easy, quick, healthy, inexpensive and delicious so five stars from me. I used homemade wholegrain bread which is a bit more robust - the bananas didn't smush in very much. I flipped my slices instead for about 20 seconds to soften the bananas -- delicious!<br/><br/>Thank you for posting."
376986,18766,2013-07-30,5,"Easy, tasty, and quick."
240552,244193,2007-10-23,5,"Superb!  We love cheesecake and this one is definitely going in the TNT cookbook!!  Yummy!!  Thanks for the great recipe, 2Bleu!! :)"
21752,244193,2007-10-24,5,"I grew up in New York City and this is just the cheesecake we used to get in diners when I was growing up.  I love the fact that it has no crust, and even though I like to top my cheesecakes with apple pie filling, I didn't this time, out of respect to my memories of New York cheesecakes of my childhood memories.  The cake was dense and delicious!"
362919,244193,2007-12-18,5,"this was only my second time playing with a springform pan, so i really appriciate the detailed instrustions that sort of ""full proofed"" the making of this cheesecake. i also loved your tip of useing dental floss to cut it. being from the area i can say that this is the kind of cheesecake we dream of when we get the craving, it was killer waiting all the time for this to cool but the wait was well worth it. I had mine plain but had cherry topping for whoever wanted it. this is definatly my new cheescake recipe, thanks bird"
67103,244193,2008-02-06,5,"I cut the recipe in half and cooked in a 7 or 8 inch sping-form pan.  I cut both cooking  times exactly in half too and it worked out perfectly!  I thought we might be missing something without a crust, but this cheesecake is absolutely wonderful just as it is written!  It is so creamy and just melts in your mouth.  This is a dessert that would be sure to impress anyone that you made it for.  Thanks so much for posting!"
89831,244193,2008-03-08,5,"this is the most outstanding cheesecake and worthy of much more than 5 stars, I made this cheesecake one day ahead and followed the recipe as directed by the poster, I topped with cherry pie filling but plan on making the strawberry topping in the near future, I have nothing but high compliments to Bird for this wonderful cheesecake recipe, thank you for sharing!"
62264,244193,2008-03-23,5,"update - AWESOME CHEESECAKE! This is simply the best cheesecake ever! Forget about a crust - the chilled butter works perfectly. I used an 8 inch springform pan(yes it was very full & tall) & I admit I added an additional egg (was afraid of such a low egg count - LOL). The heavy duty Reynolds aluminum foil was able to enclose pan in a single piece :) .Followed instructions otherwise as written, including time. This made for a luscious smooth creamy cake that sliced perfectly with a water- warmed knife after overnight chill. The mouth texture (like mascarpone) & taste is absolute cheesecake perfection! Served with macerated strawberries on the side to end our Easter dinner... DF was not going to leave w/o a slab in her take home bag! Thank you 2Bleu for my new best classic cheesecake recipe. This one is truly the best ever (from self-professed cheesecake snob)."
366672,244193,2008-03-23,5,"Absolutely fantastic cheesecake!!  
I prepped this yesterday and let the cake chill overnight. 
The recipe instructions were ""spot on"" and extremely easy to follow. 
I followed the recipe for the jelled strawberry topping and I must admit, this added the perfect ""finish"" to a absolutely ""perfect"" cheesecake.

Thank you so much for sharing this ""beauty"" of cheesecake recipe which my son and daughter-inlaw dubbed "" gosh it tastes just like ""cheesecake affair""!! 
So worthy of the 5 plus stars.  Bravo!!"
336025,244193,2008-03-24,5,"This was a wonderful, smooth and true to taste cheesecake that DF made for Easter dessert.  It was ""just right"" with the sweetened strawberries as topping.  And yes, I had took a big slab home in my to go bag!  Only need a few bites for a midnight snack after the Easter dinner has settled....."
785207,244193,2008-04-05,5,"This cheesecake was fantastic. I substituted low fat cream cheese and sour cream and I did a graham cracker crust instead to save calories. When I did the math, it saves about 150 calories a slice and it is still perfectly creamy and delicious. I think it makes it a little lighter on the stomach too. I chilled it overnight and then stuck it in the freezer for about half an hour before I served it and it was a hit! Thank you for a great recipe!"
269480,244193,2008-05-06,5,"Oh, my! This is so good I ate a quarter of the cake in one sitting! I made and had this as is.  The texture was just right and it literally melted in my mouth.  Feels like a taste of heaven!    Thanks, 2Bleu! Reviewed for PRMR."
166642,244193,2008-05-07,5,This is very delicious and melts in your mouth. My DH is more of a cheesecake lover than I am but I really enjoyed this cheesecake. I will make it again. Thanks for sharing.
37449,244193,2008-05-08,5,I made this for dessert and my DH raved over it! I've never had a cheesecake without a crust and really enjoyed it. I too halved the recipe and used your Recipe#281130. Thanks so much! Made for PRMR game.
424680,244193,2008-05-10,5,"Yes, I make way too many desserts, but as long as I have friends & acquaintances with whom I can share them [actually they're just being used by me!], I'm OK! Wanted to try this since it's billed as an authentic NY Cheesecake, something I've never had! REALLY OUTSTANDING, but I'm really looking forward to buying great-tasting fresh strawberries so I can make this cheesecake again using 2Bleu's topping, Recipe #281130! Thank you so much for sharing this great dessert! [Made for Please Review My Recipe Cooking Game] NOTE: Made this recipe again on 9 May AND also made recipe #281130 ~ OUTSTANDING, but you ought to check out my review of the topping, as well!"
136726,244193,2008-05-11,5,"Well the name says it all, just divine. This is the best cheesecake I've ever made, it turned out just heavenly. It was surpisingly quick and easy to prepare. I only had a few strawberries and lots of black berries so that is what I put on top but the possibilites here are endless. Because I was in a hurry to go out I didn't use this topping(I'll try it next time when I have more time). I used a pkg of Dr Oetkers clear glaze and added some mango juice where it called for water. Thank you so much for this recipe, it will be made again."
377070,244193,2008-05-12,5,This absolutely IS the best New York Cheesecake recipe! Very easy to prepare & as promised - no cracking either.  The only hard part about this recipe is waiting 24 hours ( I lasted 4....)  I did put a crust under it because I like it that way - used recipe #7537  For the topping I used a prepared one from Zinter Brown.  A wonderful tart & tangy Orange Brandied Cranberry which complimented the fab flavour of the cheesecake perfectly.
754645,244193,2008-05-15,5,"Mmmmmmmm!!!! This is seriously by far, the best cheesecake ever. It never goes dry, it's always moist and when you eat it you feel like your in a different world because it's just that good! :)"
369715,244193,2008-05-18,5,YUM- this was wonderful. I love cheesecake and this was the best. I followed the recipe exactly as written and I would not change a thing. Will be making again.
134613,244193,2008-06-10,5,This cheesecake is awesome and easy to make.  I absolutely loved it!  I also made the Jelled Strawberry Topping to go with the cheesecake.  Thanks so much for posting.
168069,244193,2008-06-14,5,"Take it from a New Yawka...this is the real deal only better. New York cheesecakes vary from restaurant to restaurant, or bakery and this is the creamiest cheesecake by far. Don't look any further because you are going to love this one. SIMPLE to make (I use a food processor, putting the eggs in last). The flavor is primo. Your friends and family won't believe you were able to make something this good. You will become famous for this cheesecake if you bring it to parties. This recipe is one that you can build a business on. You may consider substituting the liqueur for the lemon juice, too. Sprinkle some mini chocolate chips on a hot or warm cake, or drizzle with a chocolate ganache and add fresh berries for a special touch.  The best thing (other than the taste and texture) that I discovered about this cake is that it is gluten-free and I can make this for a party at my gluten-allergic friend's house.  Thanks for posting Bird."
117781,244193,2008-06-17,5,"Wow! Unbelievably creamy and custard-like in texture.  This is very different from the more dense recipes that I have tried,  but it was   perfect in every way.  The cheesecake literally melts in your mouth and has a very silky texture in both appearance and taste.  My only critique of the recipe is that there is no mention of what size pan to use. Judging by the large volume of batter, I decided to use a 10 inch pan and if filled right up to the top.  I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the batter because I find that it helps stabilize the batter and prevents cracking or uneven expansion of a cheesecake which can cause it to collapse in the middle. I wish I would have taken a picture of the cheesecake before I poured ganache over it, because it was the most lovely, smooth and even top that I have ever accomplished!  To make this extra special, I made a chocolate graham cracker crust and divided the batter in half.  I added 6 oz of melted bittersweet chocolate to one half and left the other vanilla (though white chocolate would have been awesome I think) and carefully poured the chocolate portion on the bottom and spooned the vanilla slowly over the chocolate portion. After this baked and cooled I made a chocolate ganache and poured it over the top. The result was a lovely black and white cheesecake. It was scrumptious, and my cheesecake aficionado dh said it was the very best he has ever had.  You really have perfected this recipe and your clear instructions were very useful.  I decorated the cake with melted white chocolate for Father's Day and it was a huge hit. This will be THE cheesecake recipe I use from now on and I thank you so much for posting!"
598671,244193,2008-06-27,5,"This is really great cheesecake. I ask Bird to make it for me all the time, especially on my birthday. It's my favorite!"
729777,244193,2008-09-01,5,"Jumped on the bandwagon and tried this one. But I used a strip of parchment paper around the edges and stuck it on with butter. No need for trying to get the cake off the sides. The paper just peels off after being cooled. Other than that I followed the recipe. EXCELLENT! For others who don't like a crust this one is the perfect recipe for you! Thanks Bird, XOXOXO"
775676,244193,2008-09-09,5,Wow!  I followed this recipe perfectly until I realized that I had meant to cut the recipe into 2/3 until I didnt' cut the eggs the same way.  And I didn't have any vanilla so I used Amaretto.  It turned out absolutely perfect!  The directions for making sure there were no cracks were right on. I have never made a cheesecake that looked this professional!  I can't wait to try this recipe again!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!
446776,244193,2008-10-21,5,"Where to begin! The instructions you gave were phenomenal.  I followed them to a T, and made the most beautiful cheesecake I have ever managed to bake, by far.  No one believed that it was homemade.  And then the taste!  Once everyone tasted it they surely thought it was a professionally baked cake!  It was superb!  Creamy and light, not dense like so many cheesecakes I've made in the past. THIS was the texture I've been trying for for years.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to cut the lemon juice down to 1/2 tsp and up the vanilla to 1 tsp.  Just personal preference. Also, I separated the egg yolks from the whites. I added the egg yolks when specified, but whipped the egg whites into stiff peaks before folding them in just before pouring the batter into the pan.  I also made a graham cracker crust for the cheesecake as I like a little crust.  I followed the baking instructions exactly as written and it turned out beautifully.  Thank you SO much Bird for posting this incredible recipe. It's my new perfect cheesecake!"
465829,244193,2008-12-11,5,"Bird, I can just say WOW! This cheesecake is silky and smooth, and it has a light texture. I didn't bother to check the temps, but just followed the instructions for time and heat. It worked out perfectly. The cheesecake didn't crack on cave in the middle. The recipe does not say what size pan to use, so I guessed from the amount of ingredients to use my big springform pan. I made a turtle topping for serving. Made and Reviewed for Please Review My Recipe tag - Thanks! :)"
197023,244193,2008-12-20,5,"Wonderfully, creamily light and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Foolproof, easy to follow instructions: always a huge plus.  I'll take the word of the New Yawkas and those who've eaten New York Cheesecake in New York that this is totally authentic! Loved it and so did the couple of friends who got to sample my scaled down first time making this recipe cheesecake.  I'm making a full-sized one for Christmas Eve.  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe, Bird.  Love lemon but for my Christmas Eve one, I'm going to follow DeSouter's suggestion and make it with a liqueur.  Made for PRMR."
383853,244193,2008-12-29,5,"I made this to take to Christmas Eve dinner with my family.  Everyone loved it.  It is so creamy and just absolutely perfect.  I didn't miss the crust at all.  I ate mine just the way it was without topping, but I did serve some blueberry pie filling on the side for those who wanted it.  This is the only plain cheesecake recipe you need.  This is absolutely a keeper.  The detailed instructions were so helpful especially since I am a first time cheesecake maker.  (Definitely not first time cheesecake eater though :) )  I had trouble with the waxed paper though.  I couldn't get the sides to still fit the bottom with the layer of waxed paper...I wrestled with it for quite a while and finally gave up.  (If there was a fly on the wall I'm sure he was laughing at me!)  Everything turned out fine though.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe 2Bleu!"
482933,244193,2009-01-25,5,"Featured in my Book#237470.  Originally reviewed on Nov. 28, 2008. Perfect in every respect!  I made 1/4 of recipe in my 5 inch spring form pan. I baked at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, and for the second phase when temperature was reduced to 250 degrees I baked it for 75 minutes, checked the temperature of cheesecake with digital thermometer and it was 145 degrees so removed it from the oven. Served ours with raspberries and  a bit of raspberry sauce-yummy and beautiful!    Thanks 2Bleu for posting another fantastic recipe!   Another update-made this a second time and b/c we were going to be gone hiking in beautiful Utah during Thanksgiving I made this ahead,  (son Ben requested this recipe) froze, and defrosted in refrigerator when we returned.  It was super!"
599450,244193,2009-02-13,5,"Wonderful! I served this twice: first time plain without topping; delicious! second time with recipe #281130; equally delicious! I love that it's crustless, and so did my guests, many of whom don't like cheesecakes with crust (although for the record, I still prefer a cheesecake with a graham cracker and butter crumb crust!). Thanks, 2Bleu! Made for <b>PRMR</b>."
318235,244193,2009-02-16,5,"Delicious cheesecake. I made it in three mini heart shaped springform pans for valentines day. I cut the recipe in half and still had some leftover, so know that this recipe makes a HUGE cheesecake. I also made a graham cracker crust using Recipe #116887. I made one plain, one marbled with about 1/3 cup melted semi-sweet chocolate chips, and one marbled strawberry with seedless jam. My boyfriend said that it was one of the best cheesecakes he had ever had. Because I was making smaller cheesecakes I only cooked at 250 for an hour and I didn't bother with the tinfoil and didn't have any trouble. Thanks so much Bird!"
1144855,244193,2009-02-18,5,"Excellent, I served this for dessert on valentines day together with a berry fruit salad.  I also topped the cake with blueberries and some crumbed dark chocolate for decoration.  I reduced the cream cheese to 3 8oz pkgs and sugar to 1 cup and it turned out perfectly."
805309,244193,2009-03-09,5,"This is such a great recipe! I had a premade graham crust to use up and not enough cream cheese, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion of cutting the recipe and the baking times exactly in half. It came out PERFECTLY. It hardly looks real! I reduced some ruby port with a little sugar to make a syrup to go over it and it was positively divine. Next time I'll be sure I have 5 pkg of cream cheese so I can make the real deal. Thank you for the only cheesecake recipe I'll ever need!"
1466337,244193,2011-08-09,3,Absolutely the best?  I don't think so.  This was rather bland and tasted ok at best.  What a looooong list of unnessesary steps!  I think this one needs a little more tweaking before it's ready for prime time.  Thanks anyway.
297705,244193,2009-03-18,5,"Thank you, Bird, for this recipe which I made for friend's birthday celebration. From the detailed instructions to the rave reviews from everyone who tasted it, it is perfection. I was inspired by Shimmerchk's review and added a chocolate wafer crust, cornstarch, divided the filling into chocolate and vanilla layers, and frosted with ganache and white chocolate.  I know I'll be baking this again (maybe a swirl next time) because I have requests for it for a few upcoming birthday celebrations. Thanks again, Bird, and Shimmerchk, too."
597054,244193,2009-03-27,5,"Absolutely loved this cheesecake! It was so creamy and light and wonderful. I used Pamela's Graham Cracker Cheesecake Crust recipe (http://www.recipezaar.com/Graham-Cracker-Cheesecake-Crust-7537) for the crust and baked the cheesecake as usual. I bought some cherry topping for it, but it just didn't need the topping...so rich and delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!"
296050,244193,2009-03-31,5,"This is the first time I have ever attempted to prepare a cheesecake - I'm a new baker.  The detailed instructions were so helpful and the cake is out of this world delicious.  My DH loves cheesecake and he said this was one of the best flavored ones he's ever had.  Thank you so very much for posting this recipe and especially for the instructions.  I would never have attempted this without your ""assistance"".:D"
978200,244193,2009-04-12,5,This is the Best cheesecake I have ever made.  I brought it to a party and this cheesecake was gone within the first ten minutes that they started serving desserts.  People actually thought it was store bought.  I did make a graham cracker crust and  I placed fresh strawberries on the top.  I heated up some strawberry jam and glazed the top with it.  Terriffic!  Alot of work but well worth it.  Thanks for the great recipe!
601528,244193,2009-05-10,5,"A real winner here.  First off the cake itself is beautiful.  The water bath prevented cracking and is just such a wonderful idea.  The cake is so smooth and creamy and melt in your mouth.  Nothing I have ever baked before has ever come close.  I had some trepidation about the crust but ultimately decided to not use one and make this exactly as written along with no topping.  This is the best ""naked"" cheesecake I have ever had.  It needs nothing to distract you from it's true flavor.  A graham cracker crust would be wonderful and you could dress this up so many ways.  The possibilities are truly endless.  This is an instant 5 star favorite!"
1105991,244193,2009-05-11,5,"WOW! This cheesecake REALLY lives up to it's name! Bird, you have really outdone yourself on this masterpiece. It was the most perfect, creamy, luscious, melt in your mouth slice of deliciousness I have ever tasted! I made this exactly as posted from start to finish (I was curious about the ""caulking"" part but Bird said caulk and so... I caulked). The only change I made was that I added a tablespoon of vanilla instead of a teaspoon. It came out BEAUTIFUL with a gloriously smooth top with NO CRACKS and it did not sink in the middle (check out my photo of it just after I removed it from the oven). I used a 10 inch pan and baked it exactly as directed. I really liked that there was no crust. I didn't miss it at all. I topped it with recipe #352749 which was a perfect compliment. This will be my one and only cheesecake recipe from now on. I'll never want any other. THANK YOU for sharing this with us, Bird!"
284180,244193,2009-05-19,5,"This was delicious; who needs crust??  I wanted a smaller cheesecake so I halved the recipe and put in a 7"" springform pan.  I kept the first cooking time at 30 minutes, and the second at 55 minutes since I tested it and it was done.  Served with a strawberry sauce.  Everybody loved it.  I want to eat the leftovers for breakfast...must...exhert...self...control..."
341170,244193,2009-06-11,5,"Mmmmmm..... I'm so glad I had a big supper or I'd totally pig out on this! I made it almost exactly in a 10"" pan other than using lemon extract instead of juice (ran outta lemons) and I didn't do a proper water bath since I didn't have a baking pan big enough. I used a regular rimmed cookie sheet with about 1/2"" of water. Not sure if I should have just used nothing rather than that, but wanted to at least pretend to do the water bath. Once done and cooled I topped it with cherry pie filling and sprinkled frozen blueberries on top. This was a very good a creamy cheesecake, deff served my cravings! It wasn't as firm as I expected, but still great none the less. I have over 1/2 the cake left, so next time I'll use a smaller pan as I'm sure my will power will not last long!"
333017,244193,2009-07-05,5,"Excellent!!!  I took the other suggestions and cut the recipe in half as I was only feeding 6 people and did not want to have huge leftovers.  My cheesecake cracked a bit, but that was OK as I served it with my recipe for #223183.  My guests ""ohhhed and awwwed"" the whole dessert.  I would definately do this one again!!!"
1097817,244193,2009-07-23,5,"Love this recipe.  I've make it a few times now and I can't just have one peice.  This Cheesecake reminds me of a Cheesecake they serve at a little dessert place in Vancouver, Canada called ""Cheesecake Etc""  This is the closest cheesecake recipe I can find to match it. Thanks for posting this awesome recipe."
724631,244193,2009-07-27,5,"Sublime, goes right into my Top Favorites of 2009! Rich and creamy, delight in every bite! This is definitely the best cheesecake I have ever made, and probably the best I have ever eaten (and I used to travel to a central New Jersey diner from Maryland for my previous favorite -- so I am serious about my cheesecake!). Used a 26-cm (10.2"")Kaiser springform pan that came with its own carrier, and this batter filled it up; I had bought a 12x18-inch professional baker's pan to provide the water bath. The instructions were very clear, and I was impressed by my crackless cheesecake due to the water bath. I used 2Bleu's Recipe#281130 #281130. My slice photo was taken after 7 hours in the refrigerator (4 hours after the topping had been added), in a somewhat soft state; the cheesecake needed much more time to solidify (although no one complained!). I plan to try making the full size again and freezing in quarters, and then making a half-portion of this batter in my pressure cooker as I did with 2Bleu's Recipe #264164 #264164. It will probably take me about a year to complete my experiments, but DH said he is up to the task. :wink: Made for Please Review My Recipe."
358698,244193,2009-11-18,5,"Let me start by saying I HATE cheesecake.  Not a littile, a lot.  That said.  This is one amazing recipe!  My cheesecake lovers gobbled it down and said it was the creamiest ever.  I made the strawberry jell topping and it was lovely.  This looks like a lot of work, but it was really quite easy to put together.  My family did miss the crust and have requested I add one next time, so I may try that.  This is fabulous as is.  Unlike any cheesecake I have ever made or tried, and... here comes the ultimate compliment....I, the cheesecake hater, liked it.  I ate just a really little bit, but it was tasty and didn't make me run in the other direction!  Which is huge for me with cheesecake!  You just might turn me into a fan.  5 easy stars.  Thanks for a great one!"
539977,244193,2009-12-24,5,This was very creamy.. but for me lacked flavor. Everyone raved about it. the bottome was very soft.
1110700,244193,2009-12-27,5,"Made this for Christmas dessert and got rave reviews. My family told me I'm never allowed to make another cheesecake. I did add a graham cracker crust. When I put it in the oven, I was afraid the baking time was too long - I've never cooked one for 2 1/2 hours before. When I took it out, I thought it was too jiggly, but I put it in the fridge and hoped for the best. No one else needs to worry about these times - I definitely got the best cheesecake ever. Thanks, Bird!"
1528007,244193,2010-01-21,5,"Very good!

I only had 2 pkgs of cream cheese, so I made a smaller batch and spooned it into buttered custard cups.   Placed custard cups into a baking pan with water and baked them for 20min at first temp and 1hr 15 min at second temp.

Cooled the mini cheesecakes and covered them with GANACHE . . . . OH  MY GOSH . . .  Very good!

Thanks for sharing!"
947839,244193,2010-06-07,5,"This was awesome. I've made this 3 times now and everyone has loved it.
Thanks."
699079,244193,2010-10-10,5,"This was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted!  It was light and fluffy, not too sweet, and just melted in your mouth.  Made it for a dinner party and it got rave reviews.  In fact, my husband thought I bought it and didn't believe me when I said I made it!  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar (because I ran out), but other than that, I followed the recipe perfectly.  Great recipe!!!"
302329,244193,2011-01-12,5,"This is the BEST cheesecake recipe!  It is so moist and creamy.  Not dry or heavy feeling at all.  I put a gluten free shortbread cookie crust on the bottom as my family prefers having a crust.  I didn't have enough cream cheese so I halved the recipe.  I followed the temps for the two different baking times, but changed the baking times.  I kept the first at 30 minutes, but halved the second time.  We didn't want to wait 4 hours to let it cool in the fridge so we let it cool on a rack for 20 minutes or so then stuck it in the freezer for about an hour before we dove in!  Thank you 2Bleu.  I can stop looking for a cheesecake recipe!  I found my go-to cheesecake dessert!!!"
1155727,244193,2011-03-09,5,"I was a little intimidated by the springform pan and the water bath.  I had never done a water bath before and I don't have a springform pan, but I just improvised with a pie pan and a large cast iron skillet with about an inch of water in it.  WOW.  It all turned out so well and I was SHOCKED by how easy it was to make!  I topped it with dark chocolate ganache and fresh strawberries!  Such an easy, elegant, and delicious  dessert!"
94881,244193,2011-03-22,5,"Outstanding in every way.  The directions: superb.  The taste: out of this world.  My husband's been on an *extremely* low-fat, heart-healthy diet since heart disease was diagnosed last June.  He turned 70 yesterday. I figured it was time to give him a taste treat, and cheesecake is his favorite.  Only he's rather particular about the kind of cheesecake he likes.  I decided after looking at a dozen recipes that yours was the one I'd try.  What an excellent choice.  I hated to think of him 'wasting'  fat grams on a mediocre cheesecake.  Not a chance with your recipe.  I added a graham cracker crust bottom b/c we both like those, and he likes sour cream tops, so I mixed a cup of sour cream and a 1/4 cup of sugar and put it on top when it was done baking.  Left it in the oven for another 10 minutes, turned the heat back up to 375 for that time.  Even without those two embellishments, this would have scored a perfect 10, though.  Thank you for the work you put into this.  You da bomb."
192264,244193,2011-05-16,5,"Very yummy! Very easy, too. Next time, I might try a crust, though, as my family thoought it would really be better with it."
1392819,244193,2011-06-09,5,"WOW!!! I wish I could give this recipe six or seven stars! This cheesecake was simply amazing and garnered rave reviews from my guests, one of whom even equated it with Junior's! I can end my search for the perfect cheesecake recipe; I will certainly make this one again and again. Thank you!!"
1942445,244193,2011-06-27,5,This cheesecake is fantastic! It is light and creamy and melts in your mouth. My 8 year old grandson says it tastes like a famous restaurant's cheesecake (but he didn't know which one lol). We didn't miss the crust either. I am going to try substituting stevia for the sugar for my diabetic family members.
1718471,244193,2011-10-22,5,"THANK YOU! <br/><br/>I am a New Yorker who knows Cheesecake and this is the recipe I have been looking for. In my opinion, these tweaks make it PERFECT.<br/><br/>-Ditch the lemon juice, taste is better without it<br/>-Ditch the Springform Pan - THEY LEAK 99.9% of the time & crust always gets soggy.<br/>-More yolks, I use 3 large eggs plus 3 additional yolks<br/>-Cooking method: <br/><br/>I use an 8"" X 4"" Fat Daddios round pan (Amazon) because I like tall cheesecakes. Line bottom (I buy 8"" round pre-cut parchment paper) and sides with parchment paper after spraying the pan lightly with Pam cooking spray so that the paper sticks. I add my crust and refrigerate the pan. About 30 minutes later, I add filling and bake (in water bath) at 250 degrees for 2 hours 50 minutes. Low and Slow.<br/><br/>I let it cool for a few hours on the counter top and then refrigerate. Next day, I put it back in a warm water bath for a minute to loosen the cake from the pan and flip it onto a flat plate - a little tapping on bottom may be necessary for it to slide out. Then I flip it a second time onto a 2nd flat plate or serving tray. The parchment paper on bottom usually stays in the pan and the parchment paper on the sides just peels off. <br/><br/>Beautiful looking and spectacular tasting. PERFECT EVERY TIME. If you do it this way one time, you will never do it any other way."
938397,244193,2011-11-28,5,"Listen. This cheesecake is fantastic! The texture, the taste is great!.  I've made your cheesecake many times with great results and I thank you!  With that said, here is a few qualifiers... I use a graham cracker crust - I use 3 cups ground graham crackers, 1 1/3 cup melted butter, and 2/3 cup sugar.  I use a 11 or 12 inch springform pan (I had a set of three and it was the biggest) and bake the crust at 350 for 10 minutes then cool completely.  I then follow the rest of the steps completely.  When I want to make a variety of a cheesecake (oreo or turtle), I use this base and just follow the ideas for the other recipe (such as Mirj's Chocolate Turtle Cheesecake #13371).  If you want to impress someone, this is the one to do it with.  The texture is thick and creamy and the cake is tall.  This method of a springform pan in a water bath is a common method in finer local restaurants in northeast Ohio.  Once you've done it once, its a piece of cake - sorry for the pun..."
231471,244193,2012-03-18,0,"After reading the reviews, I am in awe! The cheesecake may be fine, but FAR from the best, The recipie needs a lot of tweeking, as well as oven temperatures, baking times, and cooling time before it goes into the fridge."
1812036,244193,2012-04-08,5,"This cheesecake is absolutely amazing.  It is so light and fluffy, and bakes up beautifully.  I added a graham cracker crust to mine because my family prefers their cheesecakes that way.  I believe this is the first cheesecake I've made that hasn't cracked on top.  Perfectly sweet and creamy.  Thank you so much 2Bleu, I will be using this recipe over and over!!"
2452277,244193,2012-10-15,5,"This cheesecake was FABULOUS.  Our family LOVES hot cheesecake.  Once when I made a cheesecake we were too anxious to let it cool so ate it hot and we have been hooked on hot cheesecake ever since!!  I did half the recipe because I cooked it in a casserole dish and was afraid it would overflow.  I halved the cream cheese, sour cream and sugar.  I used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks.  I skipped the lemon juice and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I cooked it 30 minutes at 375 degrees and 55 minutes at 250 degrees.  Almost half of it was gone within 5 minutes of taking it out of the oven!!"

Absolutely delicious!<br/><br/>Thank you for all the tips about pan preparation, about the water bath and the trick with the dental floss. This made my cheesecake come out beautifully. <br/><br/>I am on a gluten free diet and I learned to choose great deserts that simply don't contain wheat to begin with instead of fighting that losing battle of trying to simulate wheat in a wheat recipe.  I made thischeesecake for my birthday. It was so good, I made it for an office Christmas Party. It was a huge hit!  <br/><br/>I added quite a bit of extra lemon juice, not because your recipe was lacking, but because I'm a lemon fanatic and I served it with fresh raspberries. Perfect combination!"
724697,244193,2013-06-02,5,Made this for my 23 year old&#039;s birthday celebration.  It was a major hit.  Kept hearing &quot;Best cheesecake I ever had!&quot;
9382334,244193,2014-06-16,5,You would not believe the raves I receive from this cheesecake! People think I am a genius but little do they know how easy it is to make. I use 2 eggs and 2 egg yolks and make a simple cookie crust. I use the same fat daddio pan(8x4-not springform) as ams007. Line it with parchment paper. I have also halved the recipe and used a  parchment lined 6x3 pan. I always top with fresh fruit and glazed with melted apple jelly and a bit of water. SO GOOD!
2000351360,244193,2015-07-20,0,Easy bit important to note secure good beater and have all ingredients accessible make it a 1/2 hour put together and nake
1802849661,244193,2015-08-31,4,"I just had to make this after reading all the reviews. I thought I&#039;d miss the normal cheesecake base, but I didn&#039;t. I&#039;m not sure this is the best cheesecake I&#039;ve EVER had, but it&#039;s really good. Great soft texture and everyone said it tasted great. I topped mine with some fresh berries and they went perfectly with it!"

2001653652,244193,2017-08-02,5,This was the BEST cheesecake!! I made a gf graham cracker/ choc cookie crust and doubled up on the vanilla since I left out the lemon juice. My family is raving about it and this will be our new go to recipe.
2001785098,244193,2017-11-09,5,"This is the best cheesecake recipe that I have tried so far! Easy and I got a lot of great tweaking tips in other comments to make this for my family! I do want to say, though, that the reason why no crust is listed in this recipe is that it is a gluten free recipe. My granddaughter has Celiac and can't have anything with gluten in it - so since we all like cheesecake with a crust I have found some gluten free pecan sandies type cookies, crushed them up really fine, added butter and made a crust that way. She she is also T1 Diabetic I replaced the sugar with Splenda. This brought the carb count down from 360.96g carbs (total carb count for original recipe) to just 96.96g carbs (cutting into 8 slices made it just 12g carbs each slice) which kept her blood sugar from soaring! Lol! Silky smooth and very rich looking and tasting. Thank you!"
2000046481,244193,2018-08-15,0,"I made this for my family as my daughter is gluten intolerant. They absolutely loved it (even my 10 yr old grandson who can be picky&quot;. My son-in-law said it was better than the nationally known restaurant who serves all kinds of cheesecake as their specialty!! That was quite a compliment in my book. It is time consuming to make, but I make it a day ahead and let it mellow in the fridge."
2002300327,244193,2018-10-13,5,Instructions were easy to follow. The cheesecake turned out perfect. No cracks. Just a hole in the middle for temp. So perfect I didnt want to cover it with a mirror glaze. But I had to since it was a birthday and themed. Daughter loved it. She doesn't like sweets. But loved this. Be warned this does take about 4-5 hours to complete. Worth it
164610,143209,2007-10-28,0,"Sounds like a great way to use bagels, and cheaper than buying store-bought bagel chips.  Hope to try these, but I'll prob experiment with baking them, brushed lightly with oil to cut down on the fat.  Thanks for the easy idea djmastermum! :)"
481092,143209,2009-02-08,4,These were quite the tasty treat.  I used pumpernickel bagels.  My one complaint is the difficulty of slicing them thin enough to be the right crispiness.  The chili powder was a great addition.
461834,517347,2014-09-24,5,"What a wonderful steak, so fresh!!  I love the flavor of this steak, yet it is so simple and quick!!  I tried something very similar to this but with chicken and loved it as well!!  Thanks for sharing a great marinade for steak that we will be using again!!  Made for CQ 2014."
50509,233193,2007-07-28,5,"This makes up in a jiffy, and it went wonderfully with mushroom ravioli. I could not find pine nuts anywhere, used almonds instead. The arugula and the basil work together beautifully."
163112,517347,2014-09-26,5,"Fabulous!  So easy &amp; delicious.  I even managed to cook it properly, lol.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014/CCQ."
482376,517347,2018-07-26,5,"Straight into my Best of 2018 file this goes! This steak is so flavorful and tender! The directions are perfect and yielded a beautiful medium rare steak. My husband took one bite and exclaimed how delicious it was. Then a few bites later he said it again. It's so easy to prepare and cook, too! A winner for sure. Thank you. Made for Susie's World Tour - Argentina"
88099,117886,2005-07-18,4,"This was just delightful.  It would have been good even without the custard filling.  I think next time I'll add a little extra brown sugar.  I used regular garlic, 1/2 bulb, and only 1 acorn squash for the two of us, but used the full ingredients for the rest.  We really enjoyed this and will be making it again, probably without the custard filling, kinda of bland.  It just didn't seem to add much to the recipe and we would prefer it just on its own.  No need for butter for this one.  Thanks for posting."
841835,117886,2010-10-27,4,I love this! I used regular garlic and cut the recipe in half as well. I added a sprinkle of cayenne on top of mine and it was delish.
329769,456752,2011-05-28,5,Reviewed for ZWT 7- visit to Africa. Amarula thickshake!!! What's not to like?? My husband loved this drink - he enjoyed it while I was cooking dinnner. Photo also to be posted
227978,456752,2011-06-10,5,"Oh, yum.  This is so creamy and tasty, like the best milkshake ever.  I really enjoyed it.  I used regular vanilla ice cream, but I think vanilla bean ice cream would be worth a try, too.  Thanks, gailanng.  Made for ZWT7, Mischief Makers."
107651,442276,2011-03-04,4,My daughter and I really enjoyed this roasted cauliflower! I forgot to review it until I decided to make it again and checked the recipe!!! It is very tasty!!
136997,442276,2012-07-19,4,"As promised, easy and delicious. :)"
12657,29871,2002-06-12,4,"I only have mediocre commercially grated nutmeg, but even so, this was was great! Next time I probably will use some more nutmeg, and substitute maple syrup for the honey. What say? :-)"
30716,29871,2003-07-15,5,"This is my favourite smoothie! Really fantastic, thanks Mirj! I used Low-fat milk."
53425,29871,2003-11-16,4,"Simple and yummy. I cut down a little on the soymilk and honey, and had this for supper after a too-large too-late lunch. I thought it was still just a trifle on the thin side, but really really tasty. I may make this again at Christmas as an egg-nog substitute with the addition of a little rum."
160974,29871,2005-05-10,5,"This has been my favorite for years. Such a comfort food for me. The nutmeg is a must.

43083,29871,2005-05-11,5,"Hey there! I made this smoothie today because I had a lone banana in need of a job=) He went into the blender and ""mirj""ed with the nutmeg beautifully! I loved it and my 3 yr old has a big smile on his face too. Yes it made a thin smoothie but those are good sometimes! "
128723,29871,2005-05-26,5,THIS IS VERY VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!! my family absolutely adores this drink.  ingredients i always have on hand and so easy.  followed recipe above except added a tsp. of splenda (like a little sweeter smoothie)and 1 TBS. of dry powdered milk to make it a little thicker. also the banana i used was a very brown frozen banana (such an awesome use for those bananas i have to freeze) had no problem with it being to thin with the frozen banana and powdered milk.  thank you so much Mirj these flavors together are just so awesome i'm so glad you shared this one.  thank you thank you =)
186071,29871,2005-10-07,4,A delicious smoothie. The nutmeg paired beautifuly with the banana. I froze the banana which ensured a thicker smoothie. Next time I will add additional sugar and 1 more tbls honey.
222696,29871,2006-01-19,5,"This is actually really delicious! It tastes like eggnog. :)
I used Splenda in place of honey and vanilla soymilk, and loved the results. This is a great, refreshing smoothie that I will enjoy often!
I also did not have freshly-ground nutmeg, so I just used Penzey's nutmeg."
230258,29871,2006-03-07,5,"This was a nice soothing drink! I really like the flavor the nutmeg gave the banana! It kinda did taste like eggnog!
Thanks very much for it!"
421511,29871,2007-03-13,5,This is delicious.  I did add a small pinch of cinnamon since I love cinnamon.  I also cut the milk down to 1 cup and made it for 1 serving.  I also grated some nutmeg and cinnamon on top for decoration.
320611,29871,2007-06-04,5,"I eat anti-inflammatory foods which means no sugar or honey is allowed. I wait until my banana(s) get extra ripe, i.e. extra sweet, so I don't have to add any honey or sweeteners. I use soy milk and nutmeg and then I add some cinnamon - YUMM!!  If I'm making this for a meal, I also add some Almased (protein powder) - FABULOUS!! And this is so simple to make. Any extra bananas get cut into chunks and frozen for future use."
150281,29871,2007-06-13,5,"Great breakfast. I had some bananas I needed to use and I love smoothies, so this was just perfect! I froze my bananas last night and it made it like a milk shake. Thanks for posting."
566756,29871,2007-09-01,5,"I used a frozen banana and only one cup of Almond Breeze almond milk.  It was sweet enough without the honey, and it really does taste a bit like eggnog.  Delicious!"
577513,29871,2007-09-03,3,I like it but it only tastes like Egg Nog because of the Nutmeg. I might've done something wrong but all I know is that I followed the recipe and it turned out okay. You taste more of the nutmeg than anything.
104295,29871,2007-09-08,5,Yum.  Just what I wanted this morning.  I used frozen banana and skim milk.  My nutmeg was the basic kind already grated.  It would have been even better with fresh!
586693,29871,2007-12-26,4,"Absolutely fabulous! It is a quick, simple recipe that is great for a snack or for breakfast. I used slightly less honey than in the recipe the second time as in the first twas to strong. I also added a bit more nutmeg. YUM"
203325,29871,2008-01-12,4,"The flavor of this smoothie is really good.  I like my smoothies more like shakes, so I added 1/4 cup of low fat vanilla yogurt and a couple of ice cubes."
337963,29871,2008-01-18,4,"Loved it!  The fresh grated nutmeg really makes this smoothie.  I doubled the honey to suit my tastes, which is funny since another reviewer cut the honey to suit her tastes :lol:  Thanks for posting Mirj."
734574,29871,2008-02-04,5,"This was sooooo good.  I have been on the lookout for a vegan (I used vanilla soy milk) sub for egg nog, and this was great...it really does taste like egg nog.  I also did not have freshly ground nutmeg, but it was still pretty awesome with the generic nutmeg I had on hand."
258867,29871,2008-02-08,1,"Urgh, I did not like the flavors in this and neither did my mother , who I made it for on May the 13th ! It was just weird. Sorry ."
140132,29871,2008-06-25,4,This was good.  I made this for my kids one morning when we were running errands.  The kids liked it alot.  Perfect for me when I'm on the go and the younger ones got to go with me.  Thank you for posting.
486078,29871,2008-11-07,5,"Wonderful.  I made with skim milk, followed the rest of the recipe as stated and drank the whole thing.  Thx. for posting such a quick easy morning pick me up. I served this to my self with a piece of toasted whole wheat bread with peanut butter on it.  I made it to lunch without one stomach grumble..."
130219,29871,2008-11-09,5,"Had this for breakfast this morning with a  slice of flax seed bread and peanut butter. Great flavor and very filling. I used almond milk as my choice of milk, very quick and easy to prepare. Thanks Mirj for another of your winners."
685371,29871,2008-12-10,4,I thought this was easy to make and tasted great! I actually used 3/4 C skim milk and 3/4 C vanilla yogurt. I only had ground nutmeg though. But I still liked it and will make it again. Thanks!
870390,29871,2009-08-31,5,Delicious! I only had skim milk on hand so I only used 1 cup then popped it in the freezer for awhile to thicken up the consistency. I think adding 1/2 cup of plan nonfat yogurt would have been a good add. Great taste as is though!
56130,29871,2009-09-14,5,This is great!  I make mine with vanilla protein powder (for added staying power) and skip the honey since the protein powder is sweetened.  I've had this for breakfast daily and I really enjoy it.  I never would have thought of the nutmeg - fantastic!
1544987,29871,2010-02-07,2,Made this for myself and my brother. We agreed it needed more flavor or at least more sweetener than a tablespoon of honey.
593927,29871,2012-02-11,0,"Good! I think people rate the four stars mainly because they want a thicker smoothie. I'd give it 4 stars how I made it too, with homemade almond milk to be lactose and soy free and allspice to taste instead of nutmeg because it's intoxicant properties. It was a lovely flavour."
1179225,29871,2015-01-12,4,"Really good! I had to tweak it a bit, but loved the combination of flavors and we were able to dial it in to make it work for us. After tasting the recipe as written it was a little thin, like banana milk and the flavors were very subtle.  I added another banana, some ice and more fresh nutmeg and I got the smoothie I was craving. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2001618952,29871,2017-07-09,5,It was delicious I added some cinnamon to.
341070,178128,2006-08-09,5,This is a great recipie when i was younger and used to stay at my nans we used to have this yummy drink before bed and for breakfast in the morning. Top tip leave the ice cream to stand for a few minutes before putting in the blender and place the hole milkshake in the fridge for around 5 minutes to give it a nice chill
340516,178128,2006-10-08,5,"I just made this recipe and I'm still sipping on it now^-^ lol And I have to tell you that this recipe is GOOD!!!!
I will most definately have to be making this again, thanks for the recipe."
1028544,178128,2008-11-16,1,"Too watery. I recommend 1/2 c milk, maybe less."
317499,264564,2007-11-10,4,"This was a good sandwich.  I did add swiss cheese to mine. Very simple I never thought to just use tomato's for the ""meat"" of the sandwich.  I used on the vine tomatoes from the store to have that homegrown taste.  Thanks for the recipe."
542159,449768,2011-08-21,5,Half sun-dried tomato and half tomato jam that makes a tasty topping for warm toasted French bread. Made half using the cumin option and half using the cinnamon/ paprika option using very large tomatoes which were just right at 10 hours. We all voted for the cumin ones and that will be the only ones I make in the future.  Thanks for the post.
463435,262411,2008-04-08,5,"Made this last night because DH was about to tear the kitchen apart looking for something sweet to eat. When I took it out of the oven, one of my DD took a good size slice to Dad and a smaller slice to her sister. Next thing I know DH came out with his plate and had another good size slice. A little later I went into the kitchen and there was just a tiny sliver left. DH had eaten almost the entire thing! I told him he didn't leave enough to share with our two youngest (who were already in bed) and he said ""Oh good, I guess that means you will have to make it again tomorrow night, because that was really good!""."
705251,262411,2008-04-23,4,This is a very rich dessert with the chocolate but not overly sweet which is nice.  It does taste really good with a topping of ice cream and plain (we tried both to make sure - haha).    So simple to throw together and baked perfectly in 20 minutes.  Tagged in 1-2-3 Hit Wonders Apr08
428885,432077,2011-03-02,5,"Very simple and VERY good! I was able to put this together for a quick lunch, and followed the directions exactly. Added a bit of chopped bright red tomato on top, and devoured. Really yummy on a cold, farm day! Thanks for sharing! PAC 2011"
424680,197387,2009-07-01,5,"AQBSOLUTELY GREAT CRANBERRY PIE ~ Very different, very tasty! I've made cranberry pies with lots of other fruit combos & in a number of variations, but it's a first with this one, & it really is a winner! Wish I could give it a long row of stars, & I'll certainly be making this several times during the end-of-year holidays! Thanks so much for posting it! [Tagged, made & reviewed as a bonus in the currrent Summer Spectacular event!]"
81611,197387,2010-10-29,4,"Very nice and different type of dessert. I doubled the recipe and put it into a 9x13, but next time would use my 10x14, as the filling was a bit too thick. The only change I made was to use sucanat in place of 1/2 the sugar in the batter. This was so easy to make, and I guess I would call it a cobbler; I thought the texture of the batter was similar to cobbler. This was great with whipped cream, but vanilla ice cream may be even better!"
756913,197387,2010-12-25,1,"I added thinly sliced Granny Smith apples; however, there seemed to be a lot of crust and not enough filling for my taste.  Also, the crust was too thick to spread easily over the fruit so I added a bit of milk.  Next time I will likely make a regular crust for my pie instead.  The flavor was very good but I just prefer less crust."
386585,507205,2013-10-21,4,"This was an interesting way to prepare eggs Benedict, that got varied reviews from my guests, but averaged out to 4 stars.  The sauce is very rich and quite different from the typical hollandaise sauce usually used.  While it tasted good, I did not care for the color, which was a tan shade.  Regarding the poaching of the eggs, I suggest that you undercook them, since they are later baked and could end up overcooked.  I made them in varying degrees of doneness  to accommodate the different tastes of my guests.  I&#039;m not sure why this has to sit overnight, though.  The muffins ended up a little soggy on the bottom, probably from sitting in the sauce overnight.  I think next time, I would forgo the corn flake topping.  The texture was not really popular with anyone.   However, I like the idea of the recipe, and will tweak it to my tastes next time.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
323186,333825,2012-11-07,5,"well, I love peas no matter how they come, and this was no exception!!!   I liked that I could put it in the oven and forget about it while busy with the rest of dinner.   Very nice, thank you, RGW,  made for PAC Fall 2012"
152178,323262,2010-01-15,5,"Okay, so maybe this isn't the recipe for all the chili snobs or purists, but it went over great with my family. Maybe it should be called beef and bean soup? Anyway, these simple ingredients came together for a wonderful tomatoey (is that a word?) blend. I used the mild chili seasoning mix since I'm a wimp when it comes to hot stuff. My husband doctored his with hot sauce and declared it very good. The only change I made was to add chopped onions to the ground beef while browning it. I used Bush's original baked beans and it seemed to give it a sweet flavor. This makes a ton, but tasted even better re-heated. This is perfect for winter dinners, thanks!"
201581,323262,2011-02-19,5,"My measures were all wrong on this, yet it still turned out very tasty: 1.5 lb ground beef, 2 18 oz cans beans, 46 oz V-8, chili seasoning 2.2 oz. Sometimes you need to make do with what you have. Perfect 'peasant-style"" chili, and macaroni added to leftovers will make another great meal. Thanks for the double meal recipe. Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag."
2002305484,413406,2018-10-19,3,Wasnt to exact liking so i tweaked it and added chocolate chips the second time around and it seemed to spice it up a bit for the kids and i added an extra tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon and it really topped it off!
465829,327888,2009-01-21,5,Absolutely perfect! I did not change a thing. I love brussels sprouts with bacon and the seasonings were perfect. I used the steam bag for the sprouts and they came out just right. I usually buy the single serving bags of sprouts to eat when I am alone during the day. So I plan to use some precooked bacon in the fridge and have this all ready to go for a simple ready to make lunch for one. Made and Reviewed for Please Review My Recipe Tag - Thanks! :)
61660,327888,2009-03-23,5,Simple and easy.  Loved the addition of bacon with the sprouts.  I used the Steamfresh bag of brussels sprouts and it couldn't have been simpler.
542159,327888,2010-03-08,5,"Tasty side. Made as written. Our family has also enjoyed Brussels with bacon, but the addition of garlic salt is very nice. Like one of the other reviewers used Steamfresh bag of Brussels sprouts making this a very quick and easy dish. Thanks for the post."
88099,175214,2006-10-14,5,Wonderful flavor of roasted garlic went great with good-old- Corn on the Cob.  I only boiled mine for about 8 minutes before transferring to the grill.  Very nice.  Thanks Sandi
301443,175214,2008-08-02,5,I'm definately in the 5 star boat on this recipe.  my only suggestion is make way more than this recipe calls for because it even tastes good on toasted french bread.  I just figured if I was going to spend the time making it I wanted it to be for more than 2TBSP
666947,175214,2010-05-25,5,"I made this to go with my barbecued veggie burgers... so yummy! I used margarine instead of butter. My mixture melted, but I'm temporarily without a microwave, so I used the heat from my stove. I used a brush and brushed a couple layers on the corn. Yum! Thanks for sharing."
133174,149096,2007-07-28,5,"I made this last night, refrigerated and then baked it this morning after allowing it to sit out for about an hour.  The recipe was reduced to 2 to 3 servings which worked quite well.  The bread was whole wheat French bread.  I used non-fat milk and egg substitute.  Instead of adding the pecans after all was cooked, I sprinkled them on the last 15 minutes of cooking which gave them a nice toasted flavor.  I did follow your lead and poured hot maple syrup over the cut casserole.  The directions say to preheat oven to 400 degrees and then bake at 350 degrees, I split the different and baked this for 45 minutes at 375 degrees."
2426491,149096,2012-10-18,5,This was easy to prepare and delicious! It's going on my Christmas brunch menu this year. I'm sure my family will love it too. Thanks!!
556223,243514,2010-02-02,5,"wonderfully refreshing summer salad....even great in the middle of january while we're dreaming of the warm weather.  i use a whole cantaloupe, keep all other ingredients the same.  Goes great with a little cottage cheese on the side."
49304,102568,2004-10-28,5,"A delicious, yummy, fluffy omelet  very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us, cooked the bacon in microwave, used my hand blender to beat the eggs, milk ,salt & pepper. Then made it like the recipe said. This omelet would be good with any kind of cheese, next time I am going to use Pepper Jack (YUM) as my DH suggested. Ellie, I will be making this again as it is a delicious easy omelet."
68884,102568,2005-10-08,4,"This is good and easy to make. I halved the recipe also, baking in a small round dish. The swiss was a bit strong for me, overpowered the eggs a bit, but I think the pepper jack suggestion by Barb would be awesome. Made for Pick A Chef '05! thanks :)"
169430,102568,2014-01-18,5,I made the full amount for 3 of us. DH and I took what we wanted and DS finished off the rest with no problem. I used a smaller amount of cheese because it was all I had but I think that it worked just fine with some less. I also used smoked ham in place of the bacon as it was in the fridge and bacon wasn&#039;t. 5 star voted from all of us.
56112,104823,2005-07-15,5,"My daughter requested smashed Red potatoes, and I knew that I had this in my cookbook, so we gave it a try.  I made with new red potatoes and used sour cream instead of cottage cheese because that is what I had on hand.  These were wonderful, and will be a regular at our home."
92385,99402,2004-09-13,5,"Delicious side dish that would also make a nice appetizer if cut into small portions. Mine turned out to be somewhat like a crustless quiche. A 13X9 in pan seemed too large to me for the amount of mixture, so I used a slightly smaller 20X30 cm (approx) pan. The carrots give it a sweet taste, and the herbs and seasoning are perfect in my opinion. I didn't bother with brushing with oil and broiling as mine was a lovely brown after the inital 25 minutes baking time. I think this is a good recipe to use to get the non-veggie lovers to eat their vegetables. Thanks for posting."
258867,99402,2007-03-24,4,"I made this for dinner and it was really nice ! I added extra parsley because it was fresh for once . I replaced the tarragon with poppy seeds - they really made a difference ,I think. I also tossed in a few leftover kidney beans from a quesadilla-side-salad the night before ,but they didn't make much difference.I cooked it in a pie pie plate and cut into traingles - I found I liked them much more cooled , they were similar to a spanish frittata but more veggie- and herbie- ish. I also had more zucchini than carrot. As well, when saute'ing the carrot , I tossed in a bit of maple syrup to really sweeten up the carrots. I served it with meatballs on a salad of spinach leaves and organic tomatoes. Anyway , I changed it here and there but it managed to be quite nice in spite of that :) and I'll be remembering it as its' easy, healthy and yummy ! Thanks !"
1052781,99402,2008-12-25,4,I've never made fritters befor this recipe.  But these were great.  And great if you need to keep your food budget in-check.
809882,99402,2009-06-09,5,"Oh, yummy,yummy,yummy. The carrots did indeed lend a sweetness to the dish and it was absolutely perfect in my humble opinion!  I did not have dill or tarragon so I used parsley, basil, thyme, and oregano for my herbs. Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly. Had carrots and zucchini that needed eating up and I cannot make zucchini taste good sauteed no matter what I try.  Recipezaar to the rescue, yet again!! I think the bigger baking pan is to get a thin spread so as to crisp it up a bit. Will make a regular rotation of this.  Thank You, chia!!"
2143807,99402,2012-01-11,5,"These were a great, used oil instead of butter and switched up the herbs. I also used a muffin pan to cook them so that i could have them in a single serving format. Good recipe!"
665137,99402,2013-05-09,4,This was good for me but not great. The idea of making fritters in a pan and cutting them in rounds seemed like a good idea to me. I like all kinds of fritters but they can be a pain to pan fry because they often fall apart. My problem with this dish is that it tasted more like a quiche than a fritter. You usually use eggs to bind fritters but much less in proportion to the other ingredients. I liked the way these crisped up because they were so thin but they seemed kind of unsubstantial and didn&#039;t look as pretty as a pan fried fritter. So in the end this is a good dish to get some veggies in you but I would either tweak it next time or go back to cooking them in a pan.
234003,199528,2007-04-10,5,"This recipe has a great taste and the pastry is incredibly easy to work with.  I don't know that I would have thought to use rosemary with dates, but the flavor was sublime.  I put these out at a brunch, and at first nobody was eating them.  Needless to say, I felt a little self conscious.  Then it dawned on me:  People thought they were wrapped cocktail franks that had been overcooked! Once everybody found out what they actually were, they started to disappear!  Thanks for posting, Julia."
1105991,345089,2009-04-12,5,We loved this really different style of creamed corn.  my little girl could get enough of it.  It was easy and tastey!  Thanks for posting.  Made for Pick a Chef Spring 2009.
627002,345089,2009-11-03,5,This corn is absolutely fantastic! And very easy to make also.  When broiling the cheese topping you need to be very careful for if it's browned too much it is tough and chewy and hard to cut. The corn is also great on its own without the cheese. Thanks for posting this recipe. I`ll be making it for Christmas dinner this year!
2511882,345089,2012-11-19,5,Outstanding receipe - Very festive and goes great with Prime Rib !
2001938045,345089,2018-01-17,1,Absolutely disgusting. I followed the directions exactly as stated and it was terrible. The texture was way off and heavy cream in corn? Ugh. I really don't know what to say other than I couldn't eat it.
2002333222,345089,2018-11-15,5,Absolutely love this recipe! Simple easy to follow instructions. One of our family favorites for the holidays! Great for those following Keto lifestyle (use coconut or almond flour) I Have shared this recipe with quite a few family and friends! You won't be disappointed!??
128473,496534,2014-05-02,5,"Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.  I really enjoyed it.  The french toast puffed up beautifully, but fell when I took out of pan.  I used frozen organic blueberries in this... so good.  The french toast was so quick and easy to make and had a really lovely flavor.  I really enjoyed the addition of the brown sugar topping. Didn&#039;t miss maple syrup at all.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
487098,496534,2015-04-07,5,"Was a huge hit at our Easter Sunday brunch!  So easy and a great combination of flavors.  Fruit, vanilla, and cinnamon...  How can you go wrong?"
2001098178,496534,2016-07-22,4,"I love this recipe. Very delicious, if made right. I have made this recipe before and had great success, but this time it came out very soggy and not cooked through. I put way too little bread for way too much ingredients. Here is the caution: make sure the next day that all or most all of the liquid soaks into the bread and frozen fruit works great but if you defrost it first you might add more liquid to the mix so it can also contribute to the liquid disaster. That is what I did. I would say to make sure it's mostly obsorbed into the bread before sticking it in the over or it might come out like mine did. I was so disappointed when I pulled it out of the oven and attempted to eat it. This recipe, I think should warn about that happening at least. Anyhow, I hope this held others to not make the same mistake.... Happy baking!"
442988,301252,2008-04-30,5,"Wow!  I saw this go by when you posted it yesterday, and knew I'd have to try it -- I had a pile of fresh strawberries to use up, and a bag of baby arugula.  Friends (big Bittman fans) had told me this is great, but I didn't quite believe 'em ... but you're all right!  This was wonderful!  With fresh, sweet strawberries, the really expensive balsamic vinegar, and baby arugula, this makes a fantastic salad.  Thanks so much for posting this!"
1365586,342632,2009-11-15,4,"Strangely good and comforting.  The bananas come out tender and sweet, which balances out the tangy tomato sauce.  (However, my canned sauce was too tangy and I sweetened it just a little.)  The eggs make it a filling dish. Overall, I enjoyed it."
41307,30300,2002-10-25,5,"I just tried this recipe and love it. I'm a diabetic and this is a great snack, low in Carbs.
Thanks for sharing it.

William"
14410,30300,2004-03-05,5,"Thanks for a great snack. I, too, am diabetic, so this really hit the spot for me. I used five-grain saltines, light mayo, lots of pepper, and a little salt to bring out the juiciness of the tomatoes. Delicious! My son, the junk food junkie, actually wanted to trade snacks with me, but I wouldn't go for it. I think I'm going to try a sprinkle of oregano, and maybe a little light parmesan next time. "
198228,30300,2005-04-06,5,"I love this!  I made a paste out of everything mashed together - I did not add any salt, but I did add a little garlic powder and parmesan.  It was wonderful!  Thanks"
139381,30300,2006-06-23,5,"MiniR,

I can see this recipe has not been reviewed in quite awhile.  However, I was going thru one of your cookbooks and discovered it. This has been one of my fave snack foods for year....exactly as you posted it!  And, all this time I thought I had created it...LOL!  Thanks for sharing a refreshing snack with everyone on Zaar.

Regards,

95520,62241,2005-03-16,5,Very good taste and texture: a perfect basic bechamel spinach recipe. Thanks for posting!
206248,62241,2005-04-01,0,Don't know why this needs a second chance ---my daughter makes wonderful spinach crepes with this recipe. 
176615,62241,2006-12-25,5,Nice basic creamed spinach highlighted by a sprinkling of nutmeg. We enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
482933,282240,2008-09-10,5,"Very good-better than a canned pear for sure!  I made as posted and the only change I would make next time and there will be a next time---is half as much butter. I think the natural juices in the pear could almost cook it thoroughly.  The nutmeg was very nice, and cinnamon would be good too.   I put it all on a dinner plate-easy peasy to do.   Thanks bmcnichol for posting. Made for PRMR tag."
917568,282240,2008-11-12,5,"Wow, nummy!  I used a bit of cardamom instead of nutmeg and it was amazing.  I think I'll make it again tomorrow and try the nutmeg.  Makes an excellent light supper or a healthy dessert.  Good one!"
832768,282240,2009-02-09,4,"eating this now...its good!  although i do say it could have a little something more.  I served this to myself with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Would also be good if cooked with brown sugar as well, maybe some graham cracker crumbs on top too!"
735462,285862,2008-03-05,5,I married into an Algerian family. They are loving your recipes! Thank you for posting them!
530893,285862,2009-08-01,5,"A really delicious way to eat carrots, the whole family enjoyed them.
Thanks for sharing!"
593927,285862,2012-03-05,4,"Good. I prefer it without the white vinegar I used. I used cold pressed extra virgin olive oil because I find the taste of my unrefined sunflower oil unappetizing, sweet paprika (I think hot is meant though), sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. I did not add the optional hot pepper out of preference here. Not a make again but worth a try. Made for Welcome to Algeria!"
865936,285862,2012-03-28,5,"I don't normally like carrots very well, but if I make them like this I will certainly eat them more often.  I liked the bit of heat and the vinegar flavor which cut down on the sweetness of carrots.  They tasted good both warm and at room temperature.  Made for ""Welcome to Algeria!"" cooking event in the NA*ME forum."
109235,72410,2003-11-21,5,These are so good.  I am so impressed.  I cut them in 2 inch squares and put them in muffin cups for a potluck dinner at work and they disappeared quick. Makes a nice presentation too! Thank you so much!
4439,72410,2006-01-22,5,i am trashing my previous review.i made these for a diiner party at a friend's home and these were inhaled. i guess there are more gourmet in florida than in pennsylvania. i cut these and put them in cupcake liners and they looked gorgeous and tasted gorgeous.
424680,416068,2010-04-24,5,"Although I'm not one to use tofu in my smoothies, it does work very well, & I might just start using it more often now! I did use a frozen banana though because I like the frosty chill it gives! Definitely a great tasting smoothie! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick A Chef event]"
185105,113216,2005-06-20,5,"This is TO DIE FOR!!!  My kids are addicted to Hidden Valley Ranch dressing for dipping carrots and celery into, and they have a FIT if I bring home any other brands...They were leary when I whipped this up and asked them to try it, but dontcha know they ate the WHOLE BATCH and then asked me to go to the store to buy more veggies so we could make more of this dip!  I also used it on salad, and the flavors were a perfect blend for me!  Thumbs up, HeyJude!  TY so much for posting!  Stacy  :)"
217657,113216,2006-08-08,5,"Light and refreshing..would be a great dip for something...not sure yet but will keep it handy.  I loved the flavor and the fact that I had everything on hand, except the buttermilk, but I used lemon juice in my milk and all was right in the world.  I will use this again and again....wonder if dry basil would work for winter?"
55221,113216,2006-08-25,4,"A terrific blend of flavors in a very nice summery salad dressing ~ Thanks for sharing the recipe!

"
1178926,113216,2009-07-27,0,"This was an awesome starting point, I used much more basil than called for and added a splash of white wine vinegar. It is a little thin, but didnt want to thicken it up with more mayo. It is very similar to a favorite local restaurants house dressing I have been trying to replicate for a long time. I am going to try this on a pasta salad next, I think it would be wonderful."
1241836,113216,2010-06-20,5,"The flavor is excellent, even though I couldn't wait for it to chill overnight, and even though I used milk & lemon instead of buttermilk...it was a little thin though(probably because I didn't let it set) so next time, if I plan on using it right away, I might omit a little milk and add either yoghurt or sour cream. Thanks so much for the great dressing, its just what I needed for my four basil plant harvest overload! One can only eat SO much pesto!"
597669,113216,2010-06-21,5,"I have just started to grow a small pot of basil and I made this to use with a fresh spinach salad.  It was delightful, thanks for posting"
176615,113216,2010-07-03,5,"Made with fresh basil from my garden and fresh garlic, this was amazing over a simple green salad with homegrown summer tomatoes from the farmers market. I would make this as needed, unlike most salad dressings, I think this one was best the same day. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
296809,292916,2008-06-02,4,"Made for *My 3 Chefs 2008* & picked because DH is a potato lover like most Icelanders, this potato dish is a tasty, quick & easy fix. I boiled the potatoes early in the dy & assembled this (w/chives added to the top) to be ready to bake w/fish fillets that accompanied it. When fresh from the oven, it appears to be too liquid but is a dish that gets its best texture from a short rest time. After a 10 min rest, it was less liquid, creamy & good to go. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
422893,292916,2008-07-27,4,"This was lovely & simple to make and the end result was a very creamy, rich dish. It was very liquid from the oven but did thicken up upon standing. I think I would have liked this more with some bacon added , just a personal preference. Thanks for posting!"
2001595948,292916,2017-06-23,0,"I haven't made this yet, but I'm thrilled to have found it! I was searching for a Romanoff potato recipe like I had at Russian acquaintances' house once years ago, but I KNEW it had cottage cheese and chunked potatoes in it, and all the recipes I found didn't. Then I added &quot;Russian&quot; to my search terms and voila! Can't wait to try this."
189790,159899,2006-12-26,5,I absolutley loved these appetizers! I don't like mushrooms but you can't even tell there are any in them... Very yummy!
82567,64793,2003-11-03,5,"thanks for posting this...my mom made this years ago and it's wonderful...I never did have the starter recipe though! Thanks a bunch,strawberryjane"
104877,64793,2003-11-15,5,"Some years ago I was given this recipe by a friend from Amish community; made a cake and brought it to a board meeting. The board members raved about the cake, and I have been looking for the starter recipe for a very long time. So glad to have found yours!!!  I have now made it a few times with slight variations, and enjoyed it very much. Now I will keep it in my recipe collection, and make a cake for our new neighbor across the street tomorrow.  Thank you!"
249074,64793,2005-11-21,5,"Detailed & clear instructions. I have been using this recipe for over 6 years now, and it is a joy to see it on here!
I would not know how to live a week without this working on my cabinet now!
Please note: * this can be frozen in 1 1/4 cup measurements in ziplock bag, dated, for up to 6 mos. To use for baking, let thaw 8 hrs. To use for ""starting"" a new batch - let thaw and count as Day #1...

288837,64793,2006-06-17,5,Thank you! Thank you!! I've been looking this recipe for years! Mom passed 11 years ago and her and I use to pass this one around to our friends.. it was the church rage many moons ago!! Again.. I can't thank enough! This recipe is the best.. I can't rave enough!
356505,64793,2006-11-20,5,"I loved this starter!! I have tried some others in the past but they just haven't worked.  I live in Indonesia and even with the very humid weather this worked exceptionally well!!  The sour smell starts to develop around the 3rd day.  This starter goes very well with ""Classic San Fransisco Sourdough Bread"" http://www.recipezaar.com/154142
Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!! ^^"
140008,64793,2006-11-21,5,"Worked like a charm, thanks!"
278214,64793,2007-12-13,5,"Oh thank goodness!  I was ""blessed"" enough to be given a starter a couple of months ago, but it is dreadful to think that you have to make it every 10 days, if you don't want too!  I was hoping to find the starter and now I have.  Thank you so much for posting!  Note, I baked two batches last night...one in a bundt pan (an hour and 10 minutes) and the other in the 4 mini pans (50 minutes).  The bundt pan is BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!"
540322,64793,2008-03-12,5,"Thanks for posting this! We od it exactly the same way except we store the starter in a Ziploc bag (with the date clearly written on it so you don't lose track of the days), and ""smoosh"" the bag every day instead of stirring. You usually need to open the bag every day or so to ""deflate"" it, but it makes it easier to give it to others, and safer to store in your kitchen.
You're wonderful, Kim! Thanks again!"
424680,64793,2008-05-17,5,"Never in all my cooking experience have I made something like this, but did so in order to use it in yet another recipe for one of my adopted orphan chefs in the recently concluded PAC! What can I say but that it does its work very well, so you get the brass ring! Thanks for sharing your recipe here!"
259154,64793,2008-09-02,5,I have used this several times with the starter I first began with Recipe #153. However that recipe is a 27 day starter so I tried this one with the starter I got from the end of those first 27 days. It worked great. I also used that bread recipe and it was great. Thanks for sharing. I am on my third round of starter and am excited to have this website to use.
123897,64793,2008-09-27,5,I used this to make a couple of cakes and a loaf of the best sourdough bread I have ever made.  The bread turned out sweet but so delish!
1597885,64793,2012-02-19,4,"Thanks for the recipe for Amish Sourdough, can`t wait to try it"
47230,29700,2002-07-05,5,I made this for our 4th of July party/BBQ. Easy to prepare. I liked that it wasn't over seasoned. Really intensified (sp?) the flavor of the fresh asparagus. Tender and delicious. Thank-you for a great recipe.
13063,29700,2002-10-08,5,"I didn't grill this, actually I did them under the broiler... they took maybe 10 minutes, and I turned them once during cooking.  The simple seasonings and cooking method, as stated, really does let the fresh taste of the asparagus take center stage.  Fantastically easy and the flavour is just to die for.  I actually had made this to accompany grilled steaks on Saturday evening... tonight we're having it with greek-roasted chicken.  I'm in heaven just thinking about it.  Thanks for this one!"
25722,29700,2004-04-25,5,"I may never prepare asparagus another way again! I skewered a bunch of these exactly as above and cooked them on the BBQ about 4 minutes, turning once. I made this tonight for a guest with BBQ'd lamb and roasted potatoes.  He asked that the rest of the food be removed from his plate to make room for more asparagus. I think that means five stars. Thanks for this recipe!"
55729,29700,2005-07-24,0,"I really liked these, but don't feel right giving stars since I had to cook on the indoor Foreman-clone. I loved the simple seasoning, and look forward to truly grilling next time."
235806,29700,2005-08-13,5,"OM GOODNESS!! Unbelievable... I preferred to use a small grill on the barbecue, and were these scrumptious! Almo and the family loved it... 2 forks up for this one!"
638893,29700,2007-11-28,5,YUMMY! Have made twice now and both times was wonderful!
539990,29700,2008-11-03,5,Wonderful!  Used my grill pan and the asparagus came out PERFECT!  DH doesn't like asparagus and he went back for thirds!!
25017,43099,2002-10-16,4,MMMM this is very good.  I didn't have anise seeds.  I cut back on flour to make room for oatmeal to be added.  The cranberries gave this a nice sweety tart flavor.  My family really liked.  Also used a 9x13 pan.
149363,171150,2006-06-05,5,"Ahhh...wonderful comfort food in the morning!
I used up left over potatoes for this yummy dish and my husband, my 5 year old and I devoured it.
Thanks for a well written, easy to follow and delicious recipe!"
131126,171150,2006-06-07,4,"This is a hearty breakfast, very filling and a great country meal and I halved the recipe. It went together quickly as I pre cooked the potatoes last night and keep cooked bacon in the freezer.  I served with toast as suggested and fresh melon.  Thanks Janet!   "
1273226,171150,2011-06-25,5,"Sooo Yummy!!  I kind of combined this recipe with a Paula Deen Egg recipe I found.  I used some frozen diced potatoes with peppers and some crumbled bacon.  To the eggs I added a dash of milk and dallop of sour cream.  (I was supposed to add cheese once they cooked, but I forgot.)  Even though I whisked the sour cream into the eggs, it still held together (kind of) and I could taste little bits of sour cream which was really good with the potatoes.  One of my favorite parts was the lack of dishes I had to do when we were done!!  I just wish I had made more, because there were no leftovers."
92335,102048,2004-10-24,5,So good and so easy.  The French toast turns out golden brown and sweet - you don't even need syrup!  Yummy!
133174,102048,2005-05-08,5,"This was wonderful good and easy.  I did not have the French bread but had Challah.  Sliced thick and dipped in the egg batter, it baked up perfect.  I added some of cinnamon/sugar to the egg mixture as well as sprinkling on the pan.  DH wants to know when we are having this again.  Thanks Marie :)"
37449,102048,2005-05-18,5,I quartered this recipe just for me and it turned out wonderfully! I poured maple syrup over the top and had a wonderful brunch! Thanks Marie! 
176615,102048,2005-08-28,5,"Fabulous and super easy. Would be great for a holiday breakfast or brunch. The cinnamon sugar adds just enough sweetness and a beautiful color. I got 13 good-sized slices, completely filling the pan, so would put the servings at more like 6. Even the kids ate and enjoyed this and they all hate French toast. A drizzle of honey is a nice touch. Thanks, Marie, for another great recipe!!"
212145,102048,2006-05-14,4,"Very Good!  I used 1 12oz. can evaporated milk instead of 2 cups milk.  Easy too.
Thanks!!"
135863,102048,2007-05-27,5,"Outstanding! I first prepared this for visiting family, and it has become my all-time favorite French toast recipe for ease and flavor. I like that it doesn't need the addition of  syrup or jam, and that you can regulate the amount of cinnamon sugar used to your liking.  Great served with fruit and sausage for a special breakfast. Thank you, Marie!
Lynnie"
454804,102048,2007-08-12,5,"5 stars for ease & taste, 4 stars for texture, ours was mushy in the middle. I would definatley make again for how easy & tasty it was. No need for soaking the bread overnight is a big +. I was unsure though approximatley how much sugar to use but it turned out great. The kids gobbled it up. Thanks Marie"
590901,102048,2007-09-25,5,Great recipe! Easy and quick to make. I used brown sugar as well as the regular sugar and lots of cinnamon and my husband loved it. Thanks Marie for sharing this recipe. For those who haven't tried it - GO FOR IT!!!
607367,102048,2007-11-11,5,"I have made this twice. Once with french bread, and most recently with Butternut Squash Bread recipe #111592 . Both times it turned out perfect. My kids wouldn't touch the butternut squash bread by itself, and I warned them that the next morning they'd be fighting over it (when I made this french toast with it), and I was right. So easy, and quick. The only substitution I made on the second go-round is that I used 4 egg whites to replace 2 of the 4 eggs."
219318,102048,2007-12-01,4,"This was wonderful except that the middle of the bread was still soggy.  Next time (and there will be one), I will try slicing the bread thinner and see if that helps.  I must have had a big loaf of french bread because I needed 1.5 times the liquid ingredients.  This is a delicious way to make french toast for a crowd."
491440,102048,2008-07-27,4,Fast and delicious - I added a little Frangelica to be sure to the egg mixture - and it was fabulous. Be sure to allow the bread to soak or it is a little dry. This is perfect for a busy mom on Sunday morning. So much betterthan standing over a griddle watching for when the French toast is browned! Thank you!
425154,102048,2008-08-31,5,"My son and I really enjoyed this, and  I liked the fact that it cooked itself.  I decided that I wanted the top to have a golden, crunchy cinnamon toast topping, too, so I also sprinkled some on the top of the bread, before baking.  It came out crispy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside...perfect!  I sliced the French bread a few minutes early, and let it dry out slightly, so that it would not soak up the egg mixture too much...this helped a lot.  Also, I had egg mixture leftover, so I dipped some stale oatmeal sandwich bread slices in it, baked them, and froze them, for busy mornings (and, the thin bread really soaked up the eggs, fast, so  if using thin bread, let it dry out some, first!)  Thanks for a great French Toast recipe, Marie!"
977616,102048,2009-01-17,4,"This is a great recipe!  I halved it because I was using leftover french bread and only had half a loaf.  It was perfect for two people.  The cinnamon sugar was so good, didn't need any syrup at all.  The middle of the toasts were a bit soggy, so next time I'll either bake it a little longer, or not soak it in the egg mixture quite as long.  But otherwise, very good!"
249867,102048,2009-02-11,5,"Delicious and easy!  We had as a breakfast-for-supper with bacon and fruit.  It didn't really need syrup, but we liked it with a little real maple syrup.  I used Evaporated milk, and put cinnamon sugar on both sides.  I'll adjust to add more cinnamon next time, but this is a five star keeper!"
41487,102048,2009-11-15,4,"This was pretty good.  I liked that it didn't need syrup, but it seemed like it had too much milk in the egg batter - the french toast didn't seem as 'eggy' as we like.  Definitely a recipe worth tweaking and making your own!"
220582,102048,2010-01-03,5,yum!! cut it down for two of us & used milk & honey bread and just a sprinkle of added pumpkin pie spice mix in the egg mixture. so delish.
1349472,102048,2010-01-13,5,"I really love this recipe!! Tonight we had it for dinner, but I didn't have french bread. Instead I used two slices of white bread and spread some cream cheese between them. It was delicious! I also topped it with sugar and nutmeg."
30503,102048,2010-02-15,4,Yum! These were tasty and very easy. I liked not having to keep an eye on them while cooking. Would be wonderful for guests!
169712,102048,2010-04-04,4,"We used regular old whole wheat bread (6 slices), 4 eggs, but way less milk. The liquid amount was perfect. Also we did not scatter the sugar on the baking dish but, rather, scattered it on the toast itself. We flipped the toast midway through the cooking time. Next time, we will cook it less that 30 minutes, because some of it burned... but, still, this is a great idea, and we intend to make it again!"
1594468,102048,2010-06-20,5,"This is absolutely delicious!  I'd always hesitated to make oven-baked French Toast, but this is the only way I will make it from now on!  Now I'm always tickled to have leftover French or Italian bread so I have an excuse to make this wonderful dish.  I sprinkle extra cinnamon-sugar on the top before baking.  I end up eating it slowly to savor every bite!  Everyone in the family loves it, and it makes a great dinner as well as breakfast."
1108191,102048,2011-05-26,5,"Loved it!  Made this for supper along with some turkey bacon and canned pears.  I had medium eggs so I used 6 of them and the whole amount of milk.  I also added a couple of TBS of flour while whisking the eggs (just how I make my french toast).  I dipped each piece of french bread in the egg mixture while the margarine was melting (next time I think real butter would be better) and then put each piece of bread on the tray after liberally sprinkling with cinn/sugar and spooned a bit of the egg mixture on top of each piece just before putting in the oven.  At the end of 30 min baking time, it wasn't as crisp as I'd have liked so I flipped it over and broiled the top for a min or so until brown.  Changes I'm going to try next time:  real butter instead of margarine, cinnamon with BROWN sugar sprinkled onto the butter and baking at a higher temp to crisp the bread a bit more and avoid using the broiler.  And I wanted to add that for making french toast, I always buy the discounted day old french bread - it's cheap and works perfect for this use! I LOVE this recipe/concept and will make it often!"
1242099,102048,2012-01-25,5,"I find that bumping the heat up to 400 has a better result.  I cut the butter to 1/3 cup the second time I made it, and we didn't notice a quality difference... so better light!  Today I tried 1/4 cup butter, which was also really good.  Also, I use brown sugar for sprinkling... approximately 1/3 cup.  <br/><br/>Really good recipe that I'll make again... it's easier than making smaller quantities on the stovetop and tastes great.  Thanks."
196059,102048,2012-12-27,5,This was delicious! I made it with eggnog instead of milk for Christmas breakfast. It was fantastic.  I agree that the butter could be cut. We'll definitely be making this again.
1346407,102048,2013-12-26,0,Excellent!  I made this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it.  I made it more like a bread pudding casserole with torn bread pieces in a 9x13 pan.  The top was a little crunchier than I would have liked . . . when I make this again I&#039;ll probably cover the pan for a bit.  Thank you for sharing.  Most similar recipes recommend overnight soaking; I didn&#039;t miss that step a bit!
2000382010,102048,2017-02-05,5,"This recipe, with a few minor tweaks, might be the best recipe I've come across for French Toast! I used 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup (and I feel like it was still pretty &quot;buttery&quot;). Instead of a whole loaf, I used 8 slices of Old Italian Bread from Franz Bakery. I made a &quot;three-quarters&quot; batch of the remaining ingredients. I preheated the oven to 400 degrees and baked the bread for 25 min, flipping it over when 20 min had passed. Finally, I combined 1/3 cup brown sugar with 1/4 tsp cinnamon and sprinkled about 2/3 of the resulting mixture on the melted butter, laid the bread on top, and sprinkled the remaining mixture on top. This recipe is so good!"
424680,291723,2008-06-28,5,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS DISH! Asparagus is one of the few veggies I make regularly around here, & this is such a GREAT WAY TO DRESS IT UP, with a VERY TASTY SAUCE! The dash of cayenne is about my speed & does make for a very nice addition! Thanks for sharing! [Made just for the 'hal-ib-ut!']"
37449,291723,2008-11-06,5,"This was a very nice dish with the smooth, creamy, citrusy sauce. I really enjoyed it! Thanks Kate!"
133842,291723,2009-03-26,5,"Kate!!!  This is just great!!
I actually served it cold and truly enjoyed it. I'm sure it would be awesome warm too. I will be making this a lot this spring.
Ohhh,  the sauce, I would love to try it on other things too it was great."
89831,291723,2009-07-12,5,"Loved this! I doubled the recipe and used 1 pound asparagus, also I used 3 tablespoons frozen thawed orange juice concentrate with really increased the orange flavor, great recipe for asparagus, thanks for posting Kate!"
1436160,291723,2014-04-21,5,"This wonderful dish was served with Easter dinner. I made the sauce a day in advance using fresh squeezed orange juice. I ended up doubling the amount of orange juice for a stronger orange flavor, tasting and stirring after each addition. The sauce is so easy to make; I&#039;m sure I will be making it often. Thanks for sharing! Made for Spring PAC 2014."
165623,291723,2014-04-23,3,This got mixed reviews at our house. While most liked the sauce they just didn&#039;t care for it on the asparagus.
107135,154224,2006-02-02,5, i love making this . it is very easy . i like adding mushrooms . thank you for posting this dee
173579,154224,2006-07-21,5,This was so easy to make.  We just loved it.  The parmesan in the middle added so much flavor.  Thanks for sharing.
176615,154224,2006-11-21,5,"Easy, fast, and everyone loved it. Skipped the pepperoni. Used 16 Kirkland (Costco) ravioli which are larger and were enough to fill an 11x7 pan. It sure beat boiling water and draining the ravioli. We'll definitely have this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
435683,154224,2007-02-26,5,"Loved this recipe, I made it for some friends as I was watching their kids at their house and took half home to my husband.  I made my own spaghetti sauce and put textured vegetable protien instead of using meat I am not a big pepperoni fan and everyone thought it was excellent, they couldn't even tell there wasn't meat, they thought I used hamburger!!  Great tasting."
268973,154224,2007-10-19,5,This was really great - easy to make and tasted delicious.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!
123964,154224,2007-11-19,4,"THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, I love it! So easy, on a day when I have so much to do, this is fast and good. I have had it at the home of a friend, NOW I HAVE THE RECIPE!!! The best part is not having to cook the pasta first."
486718,154224,2007-12-03,5,The whole family loved this! My husband did ask if next time I could also add meat ravioli which I will as this one is a keeper!
705251,154224,2008-01-12,4,"My family loved this recipe!  We also omitted the pepperoni and used meat ravioli.  My DH and DD loved that it had a firmer texture than regular ""boiled"" ravioli.  We even had my DD's friend over and she wants the recipe to take home to her mom :grin:"
169712,154224,2008-01-13,5,"This really does work!  I did it without the pepperoni, and with way less cheese, and it was still super rich and filling.   My only problem was that after an hour at 350, the middle was still not quite cooked through, so I had to put it up to 400 for twenty more minutes.  Next time, I will try it at 375 for 45 minutes and see where that gets me.  Thanks for posting!"
199848,154224,2008-04-07,5,"I easily doubled this recipe in a 13 x 9 baking dish.   I assembled this in the morning, put it in the fridge and baked it later for supper, so my raviolis had time to thaw a bit.  The pepperoni was a nice little ""surprise"" for thne kids.  Thanx for a quick and yummy meal!"
425008,154224,2008-05-18,5,"This was really good, however I baked mine at 375 for an hour & they turned out perfectly! Very good & extremely easy."
58439,154224,2008-05-21,5,"LOVE this!
SO easy, do not give this a miss!
Doubled recipe, used 1/2 mini mozzarella, 1/4 fat free parm cheese!
On a cold winter's day, this certainly does please!
THANKS!
Omitted pepperoni, felt was healthier, TRUE!
THAT'S what I love about versatile recipes, as can slightly change without totally changing submitted recipe too!"
1072593,154224,2009-01-16,5,"Soup Fly, there's the good, the bad and the SCRUMPTIOUS.  Never in a million moons did the notion occur to me that frozen ravioli could be baked.  The addition of pepperoni was clever and added punches of flavor.  This was received so well that I'm already planning a repeat.  Oh, the ease of preparation is ridiculously simple...an absolute keeper!"
355637,154224,2009-01-25,4,Insanely easy!
1112060,154224,2009-02-22,5,"This was good and so easy! I used meat filled ravioli it was delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cook it a little longer. Our ravioli came out 'al dente'  but we would probably like it a little softer. Other than that, perfect! Definitely try this one."
783601,154224,2009-04-09,3,"This recipe tasted fine, but it didn't seem all that easier than to do it the old fashioned way. I checked mine at 30 minutes, and it was still cold. I finally took it out when it was warm and heated it in the microwave. Seems like a good concept, just didn't meet my expectations."
880866,154224,2009-05-17,5,This is absolutely delicious.  Very easy to put together and tastes much different from ravioli cooked on top of the stove.  Highly recommended.
1300155,154224,2009-06-18,4,"It was great, however, I would recommend increasing baking time. Mine was stone cold after 30 min at 350. I put it back in for 20 minutes at 400 after to cook it. I opted out of the pepperoni."
124190,154224,2009-07-03,4,Yum! Great easy recipe>.I too needed more time in the oven. But it was worth the wait! Will def make again. Thanks for sharing!
866963,154224,2009-09-20,5,I used this recipe for the method rather than the ingredients since I used my own sauce and baby meatballs rather than jarred and pepperoni.  Everyone was pleased with the results and it saved me time by cutting out the boiling step.  From making lasagna and other dishes I have found that if you give the tin foil a spray of PAM it will keep the cheese from sticking.
1663103,154224,2011-01-13,5,"You have to cook more like 45 minutes and to prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil just spray the foil with some cooking spray before putting on.  BUT...this is awesome, I leave the pepperoni out and just add 1 lb of hamburger to the spaghetti sauce."
1198738,154224,2012-05-23,5,"Super!!!!!   Doubled recipe, used cooking spray on the foil as suggested, and baked at 350 for l hour.  Perfect!  Would never have thought of doing this, and didn't really believe it would work, but am delighted with the results!"
309360,154224,2013-02-20,5,Omgosh I will never boil ravioli again this recipe was GREAT. Since it was only two of us I ended up making one layer in a casserole dish. I didn't have time to defrost the mozzarella cheese so I used frozen cheese with my frozen ravioli. I also used grated parmesan cheese <br/>(didn't have shredded parm) and just let it cook a little longer. . I also omitted the pepperoni because I didn't have any on hand.It was Delicious! I definitely will be trying this again
2715825,154224,2013-02-28,5,I LOVED this recipe. I added 2 slices of deli ham (shredded) and some sliced mushroom to my center layer. I also used medium cheddar instead of Mozzarella on this. It was extremely rich and i enjoyed it so much both my Husband and i went back for seconds. However we both agreed that next time i should definitely try the pepperoni and mozzarella! I can see this being a regular on our dinner table. I can't wait to make it again. Thank you!!
1708613,154224,2013-04-01,5,Excellent recipe.  I used meat sauce I had in freezer instead of pepperoni.  Did not put the mozzarella on right away.  Baked at 350 for 30 mins then increased to 400 and put on mozzarella and took off foil and baked another 15 mins.  So easy and very delicious!
345884,154224,2014-02-14,5,Wonderful!  And so easy and fast.  A keeper!
423780,154224,2014-02-15,5,"I have always used Crock Pot Ravioli #64138 by Bekah in the past but forgot to get it going this morning. So I am rating this for the method, which is wonderful. I used the ingredients from the crock pot recipe, adding the parm from this one and the results were fantastic. I baked it 45 min. @ 350. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks for saving my dinner."
37779,154224,2014-12-21,5,Perfect busy night meal. Used turkey pepperoni and a jarred mushroom merlot sauce. Delicious and so easy. Thanks for a great recipe.
305531,154224,2015-06-23,5,Such a simple quick dinner for a busy week night. My grandson devoured this. Thanks for sharing. Made for What&#039;s on the Menu tag.
1530765,154224,2015-10-20,5,"This is truly genius. The method is brilliant and it lends itself to whatever you want to add. We like cooked, crumbled Italian hot sausage instead of pepperoni, or just use my own meat sauce. It needs at least 45 minutes in the oven, though. You really have to rely on your own judgment here and think for yourself because everyone&#039;s oven is calibrated differently. This is comfort food at its finest, and reminds me of the DELICIOUS ravioli they used to serve in my high school cafeteria. Hey, don&#039;t laugh. I don&#039;t know about you, but we had some SCREAMING cooks at our school. Man, could those ladies cook! It&#039;s high praise indeed to say these raviolis are just as good as theirs."
2001118994,154224,2016-08-07,1,"Not really a recipe. It's frozen Ravioli, pre-made sauce and cheese...Make the Ravioli and sauce from scratch with some fresh ingredients."
2001433133,154224,2017-03-13,1,"This isn't a recipe. Its assembly instructions. To make this dish properly you need... 3 eggs 300g dopio zero 250g ricotta 125g mozzarella 2 tins pomodori Fresh basil Olive oil Garlic Parmesan And maybe some other things if you like, but having half a brain and a few taste buds might help."
1911882,154224,2017-03-27,5,Absolutely Delicious and so easy!
2001530133,154224,2017-05-10,0,"I do a variation of this. I use cooked ground beef &amp; the prego to make a meat sauce, follow rest of the recipe. Its so delicious &amp; easy peasy."
1175362,154224,2018-02-01,5,"Thanks for the great way to prepare a tasty, easy, impressive dinner in so little time with so few ingredients! I put it all in an 8X8 (2 quart) Corningware casserole dish and, because it was so deep, it did take longer to bake (50-60 minutes). Delish!"
2000659458,154224,2018-10-08,5,"Made this for my honey and his friend. They crushed it. I mixed the raviolis in the sauce before spreading in pan, otherwise made it just like the recipe. Next time I may try spinach and cheese ravioli for something different. They LOVED it as it was and I will add this to my rotation of meals! Super fast and easy."
2002328984,154224,2018-11-12,5,"I made this for the 2nd time today and my husband loved it again. I didn’t have the pepperoni so I thawed leftover meatballs and sliced them in layers instead. I also added sliced mushrooms (one of my favorites) and it was just as tasty with my adjustments. I need to take a large dish to a family birthday dinner, so I think I will take one vegetarian and one meat, easy to do with this recipe and something that will make everyone happy. This is going to become one of my Go-to recipes!"
160205,69851,2008-02-03,5,"Very good, a nice difference from a plain old baked potato, this recipes a keeper!"
2000935395,69851,2018-03-21,5,This is by far the best and the simple potato recipe I've tried. You simply can't go wrong with cheese on anything. It brings out the best in whatever you cook. :)
35193,69851,2003-09-14,5,"Easy and excellent!  For uniformity, I used my mandoline for slicing the taters.  I don't think a mandoline is necessary. But, if it helps anyone, I sliced about 3/4 of an inch thick.  I used 3/4 tsp garlic powder and 3/4 sea salt in place of the garlic salt and 2 tsp dried parsley.  Those potatoes would only fit in my 9 x 13 dish by overlapping, so I first spread them on waxed paper to sprinkle the seasonings on, then placed them in the dish in one overlapping layer.  After, I drizzled the butter (I used 3T) evenly over all.  I even took the leftover potato pieces and sprinkled them with the seasonings and wrapped them all up together in a piece of foil for snacking.  That's just me!  My kids LOVED this and it was so EASY!  Yay!!!!!"
153188,69851,2005-04-27,5,"This was absolutely posituley the best thing i've ever tasted in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This will be made on a weekly occasion, if not more, and thank you thank you thank you for the recipe!!!Yummmmmmy!!!"
65056,69851,2005-05-02,5,"It's amazing how something so simple can have such great flavor.  Easy as pie and really lovely.  The small amount of the two cheeses tasted wonderful.  The potatoes were slightly crusty with great texture and flavor. We enjoyed this with beer simmered brats, but I think it would be a great side for anything.  I made a half recipe to serve two, and baked in a 2-Qt casserole dish (about 9x9) worked perfectly.  Great little recipe."
36944,69851,2005-05-29,4,"This is an easy recipe to prepare and it uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I used two large potatoes, but I left the rest of the ingredients as stated in the recipe.  I would suggest that as you layer the potatoes to sprinkle the spices on each layer.    It took about 70 minutes for mine to cook, including the time for the cheeses to melt.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Marie. "
88099,69851,2005-08-07,4,"Very nice.  I only used 2 baking potatoes (just the 2 of us) and sprinkled each of the two layers with the garlic salt and some butter.  I added a little ground red pepper to the last layer.  Did not have any fresh parsley, so I left it out.  I had to cover mine with foil after about 25 minutes.  I did add some extra cheddar cheese and also the parmesan cheese.  We like cheese.  Great recipe and easy to put together.  Thanks Marie"
183098,69851,2005-08-07,5,"This is a very nice side dish.  I followed your instructions with the exception of adding some chopped chives in with the parsley....I think that next time, I will slice the potatoes a little thicker....I sliced these sooooo thin, almost like chips.  Probably 1/2"" - 3/4"" is optimal.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe~
--Marla"
176615,69851,2005-08-08,5,"Very easy and quite delicious. A nice side dish for dinner but would also be nice for brunch. The potatoes were thoroughly cooked with a nice crunchy cheese top that we all fought for. Seasoning is simple without being bland. Thanks, Marie, for another super recipe!"
355637,69851,2007-02-23,5,"Oh yeah, these were tasty... although I think my husband would rate any potato side dish five stars, as long as it has cheese!! I do agree with another poster that I had sliced them a little too thin, a few of them were crunchy like potato chips by the time it got done cooking. But they still tasted so good... will definitely make again!!"
4291,59334,2003-11-28,5,"This was an easy, yet festive dish to serve on Thanksgiving.  The flavors were light and sweet.  A good way to serve squash for those that don't like it.  I had to bake it a about 1.5 hours it was only about halfway cooked at the 1 hour point.  Thank you evelyn/athens for the good recipe."
4470,59334,2004-04-02,5,Evelyn the stuffing is heaven and I can think of a dozen other ways to use it.  It is crunchy and the flavor is excellent. I used  Sweet & Low Brown sugar substitute - no problem. I too found that it needed 1.5 hours baking but then it all depends on the size of the squash.  I cut the recipe back to make 1 squash (2 halves) no problem. You do not say what size of box of Ritz-I did double the crackers to the almonds Thanks Evelyn - loved this recipe
2000959999,260524,2016-04-06,5,I made this recipe low carb and it was great. I used flax seed instead of flour and used 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream and 1/3 cup water instead of the milk. Topped with Walden Farms no calorie/carb jelly. Yum!
27643,24452,2002-05-29,5,"Oh, how easy!! And oh, how good!! We loved this! I sliced the apples very thin, used a pinch of allspice, and drizzled a T of melted butter down the center. I brushed it with an egg wash and sprinkled a little bit of sugar over the crust. This is very good!!"
135566,209792,2012-05-30,4,Loved the topping on this crisp. I used Fuji apples and because I have a sweet tooth I used the full amount of sugar. Served with a scoop of frozen vanilla yogurt on top.
416322,24513,2007-02-13,4,"This turned out to be a very moist cake.  It was very good, but I think I cut my apples too small because I really couldn't tell that they were there. Thank's for the recipe."
359220,26027,2008-05-15,4,"Nice recipe Mille!  I'm not a huge turkey burger fan, but both DH and I agree that this recipe will make quite a few appearances on our grill this season.  I too cut down on olives (just under 2 ounces) and on feta (about 2 ounces was more than plenty)...in fact I'm not sure the burgers would have held together if I'd used the whole 8 oz!  Quick, tasty, healthy...can't ask for much more."
38327,26027,2002-06-05,5,"These were excellent.  A healthy burger, grilled no less.  Who would have thought a turkey burger could taste so good.  I served it with a pasta salad.  Very nice on a hot summer night."
62408,26027,2003-12-19,4,"Very tasty!  Also great with Bleu Cheese (insead of feta) mixed in, and sauteed onions on top!

Great to have a second way to make turkey burgers."
140424,26027,2004-05-12,5,"Delicious!  We didn't have any burger buns, so ate them plain, and they were great.  Didn't even have mustard or ketchup on them.  Yummy.  My only complaint is that now my husband is going to want these for every meal! :-)"
35526,26027,2005-08-25,5,This is a winner folks.  Few ingredients and full of flavor.  I added a clove of fresh garlic and I used the George Foreman and it was really a great meal.  I made an extra for lunch today.  
120843,26027,2005-09-19,5,"YUM!  I don't eat red meat, so I am always on the lookout for a new  way to cook ground turkey-I used black olives in this recipe & served them on whole grain buns with tomato and lettuce. Yum!!  (or..did I already sat that?)"
159398,26027,2005-11-04,5,These were great and had so much flavor. I will definitely make them again!
234222,26027,2005-12-19,5,"WOW - these turkey burgers were excellent!  What an easy, but tasty, recipe!  I am allergic to olives, so didn't add them, but didn't even need them.  My hubby and I loved these! This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!"
300235,26027,2007-02-14,5,Great on the grill or on the Foreman girll. Exceptional taste great mix of ingredients. Very easy and well worth it for turkey burger lovers ..
451042,26027,2007-02-27,5,"This recipe really adds a nice punch to ground turkey and the flavors all compliment one another. I added a half of a freshly squeezed lemon as well to the mix. Grilled them over high heat until seared and then flipped them, lowered the temp and shut the grill lid. I also melted some pepper jack cheese over the top at the end. Thank you Millie!"
269331,26027,2007-03-15,5,"Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best!  The recipe called for â€œolives,â€? I used calamata and grilled them indoors.   They were absolutely wonderful!!!!"
514193,26027,2008-04-16,5,"Awwwwwwesome! 
I did it a little differently... added some crushed garlic, bottled lemon juice and a few dashes of some greek spices I had on hand.  Grilled 'em on the barbie for the given time (a bit longer cause I'm paranoid and they were really thick).  They really seemed to be falling apart and sticking when I first tried flipping them, but after they cooked a little they started staying together better.  I think next time I'll put some non-stick foil over the BBQ grate just so they don't stick so bad, and aren't so hard to flip. 

Topped them with a big dollop of tzaziki and ate them on crusty kaiser buns.   Yummy!

 I'll definitely make these again!"
176481,26027,2008-05-03,4,"These were very good in flavor but way too much feta for the recipe.  I had a 1 pound + 3 ounce amount of ground turkey, but still it was too much feta for the consistancy.  I recommend cutting it in half, I think this would be plenty.  The flavor was great & my BH added sundried tomatoes to his, liked it, still too much cheese for him as well.  We'll be doing this one again with modifications, still like the flavors."
597546,26027,2008-05-08,4,I used ground beef. I cut the feta in half and added lots of black olives along with 1 T. Greek seasoning.  They turned out really well and we really enjoyed them.  I made 4 smaller burgers and then grilled about 3 minutes on each side.  Cooked to med. just like we like them.
230860,26027,2008-05-12,4,"These were very good!  I used burgudny olives for this and about half the feta as someone suggested.  Having never had turkey burgers before, we were not disappointed that these were our intro to them.  I served mine on a bun with some caesar dressing and lettuce.  The only gripe we had were that they were a bit on the dry side."
539686,26027,2008-07-25,4,These are very good and have a great flavor. I also used less feta and there was still plenty. My only problem was that were a little dry. We used moist toppings and that helped a lot.
148715,26027,2008-08-12,4,"Yummy, they were quite good."
140737,184280,2006-09-13,5,"This recipe is FABULOUS!  I was told that quiche was supposed to be sort of like a custard pie, but this comes out as a rice/veg/cheese and egg layer cake.  I used jasmine rice, and the teense of soy sauce just gives it incredible flavour.  Not to mention that it's so filling.

It's so good, that I'm eating the green beans in it.  Coming from someone who refuses to eat green beans, that's quite a compliment.

I'll just be over here purring in contentment, while I think what all I can put in it next time."
102058,184280,2006-09-20,3,"Axe, This recipe was easy to make and made excellent use of leftover veggies and rice, but suffers a little in it's blandness. I would make it again, but next time with the addition of some fresh herbs. I have, and have tried many similar recipes and while this one is not at all bad, it is not quite in the hemisphere's of my 4 or 5 star ratings ... (once you have been on Zaar a while you will find you get more demanding of recipes). That said, it's ideal for kids and was a lovely recipe for a week day dinner. Definiately very edible, just lacking raves. I will certainly make it again, Please see my rating system, a very respectable 3 stars:) Thanks !"
63232,184280,2007-02-10,4,"This was really easy to make.  I was too impatient to wait for some leftover rice to appear in my fridge, so I cooked some up for this recipe. :-)  I also steamed some broccoli to add to it.  I give this extra points because it was frugal as well as tasty.  I did add some onion salt and chivesto the egg and milk mixture so it wouldn't suffer from blandness.  I will definitely make this again!"
5060,184280,2007-04-22,4,"We enjoyed this a lot for Sunday brunch, I used green onion, parsley, red pepper, tomato and a quarter cup of salsa. And of course the cheese on top, happened to have some cooked brown rice in the freezer left over from a fairly spicy jambalaia which added some zip with the salsa. I will make it again, great for leftover stuff, thanks for posting."
450571,184280,2007-05-23,5,"This was so good, and I love this recipe because you can absolutely use anything that you want in it.  The crust was a great idea too, I really liked it because I'm not a big fan of pastry type crusts.  I used roma tomatoes, potatoes, yellow and green onions, fresh baby spinach, fresh basil, and fresh rosemary topped with mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  It was sooooo good.  Thanks for posting!"
1903982,184280,2011-05-08,3,"This recipe is a very good starting point! I used a sweet red pepper, an aneheim pepper, mushrooms, scallions, and minced garlic. I did alter/add more spices, such as 1/4 tsp of cumin and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the egg and milk mixture. Also, I think next time I will try adding a little flour to the crust mixture so it doesn't crumble as much. Other than these 2 alterations, the recipe is a good one! My taste-buds were thrilled."
126440,184280,2014-04-06,4,"Turned out great for breakfast.  Didn&#039;t have 2 c. rice but probably 1+ c. so added 2 T. flour for the crust.  Added mushroom, onion and red pepper for the veggies which I saut&eacute;ed for a few min. Then added half a can of green chills.  Added 1/2 t. cumin to the  3 eggs and 3/4 c. milk.  It filled up the pie plate so couldn&#039;t have used all four eggs.  Topped with Mexican cheese, baked for 33 min. served with a slice of ham."
135566,122614,2008-09-14,5,Excellent way to eat baked potatoes.  I used recipe #27947 for the chili and Kraft fat-free shredded cheddar.  I also put a small dollop of reduced-fat sour cream on top.
486725,122614,2014-12-04,4,A weeknight meal that&#039;s fast and tastes good. The cheese is really good on it too (though I am pretty sure we used less).
1045753,317713,2010-02-05,5,"I live this recipe.  I actually got it from my mother-in-law a few years ago.  I started looking for it on zaar, because I had misplaced it.  I love this so much I will eat it three meals a day until it is gone.  and it is so easy."
112064,6813,2004-03-19,4,"I made this last weekend, and wowed my audience! Yummy way to start a lazy Sunday....only change I made was to add some salt to the mushrooms as they cooked - drew out the moisture. Great recipe! "
5060,6813,2005-06-26,4,"We really enjoyed this omelet, the taste was definately a 5, but sorry I had to give a 4 because I think for an omelet this size there was way too much filling, I had a hard time fliping it once it was filled. Perhaps next time I would add an additional egg or make it into a fritatta, or of course use less filling. All in all it was delicious, thanks for sharing a keeper!!"
140107,6813,2005-06-26,5,I used five eggs and less salt but more pepper. you have hit a homerun with this.
165207,6813,2005-10-14,4,"YUMMO!!  My omelettes turn out more like scrambled eggs due to my impatience, nevertheless this was delicious.  A quick, simple, tasty lunch :)"
316250,6813,2006-08-29,5,"excellent! i threw in a slice of provolone cheese and instead of basil, used italian seasoning.  served with bacon and called it a weeknight dinner. my husband raved!  "
184530,6813,2007-12-01,4,"I really enjoyed this.  For one serve I halved the eggs and milk, used a small clove of garlic, four asparagus spears, two mushroom caps and six basil leaves.  Rather than boil the asparagus I sauted it in a non-stick pan, along with the mushrooms, for about five minutes - my asparagus was quite thick.  I then wiped out the pan and made the omelet, adding the ingredients as specified.  I only just noticed parmesan can be added.  I'll make it again soon with parmesan, and will update my review."
29783,115092,2005-09-28,5,"This was FABULOUS.  I only had thick sliced bacon so I used 5 slices of bacon.  I also thought I had potatoes, but alas I did not so I guess mine was more of a soup.  I also did not add additional salt since recipe calls for 2 cans of soup, and I added a bay leaf. Otherwise I kept to the recipe. As the cook I couldn't stop ""testing"" during cooking.  I almost couldn't eat during dinner, but I ""managed"" to make room (haha).  DH has requested it be added to our soup suppers.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!"
232480,115092,2005-12-23,4,"I followed this recipe exactly.  I didn't add any salt at the end since the soup and the bacon are salty enough.  I didn't particularly care for this but dh liked it.  It was definitely easy to prepare, though!  I am not sure what it was that I didn't care for - when I figure it out, I may try this again. "
809083,4568,2008-04-20,4,THis is a very yummy and easy to make dish.  Our whole family loves it.  We just added extra bread and that made it perfect (we have a big family so we have to double it and add extra bread)
764613,4568,2008-05-10,0,Just like my paternal grandma used to make!  I'm so thrilled to find and use this recipe ... my married daughters come home quite frequently and ask for my favorite recipes.  This is definitely one that I will be sharing with them!
543291,4568,2017-11-16,0,something is wrong with this one since the move to Genius Kitchen - how many cups of sugar?
779699,399771,2010-02-01,5,"This was great comfort food for a snowed/ iced in evening, without being overly heavy! Changed DH's mind on eggplant too. :) Made for Veggie Swap January 2010."
464080,399771,2010-02-11,5,"Loved it.  That being said, I was out of mozzarella cheese (used it to make a cream sauce for some gnocchi to go along side this recipe) so I used fat free cottage cheese which made my end result kind of like a veggie lasagna with no noodles :)  So yummy.  I obviously didn't get all of the moisture out of the eggplant as it was swimming upon being baked. . .I just dumped out the water and it was good to go.  I used homemade marinara sauce Recipe #3445 which had mushrooms in it (nice touch as well).  YUM.  Shared the leftovers with our neighbors too.  Made for Veggie Swap Feb 2010."
226863,399771,2013-01-20,5,Loved this non-breaded version of Eggplant Parm!  I used low fat mozzarella and shaved parmesan instead of grated.  Turned out deliciously cheesy!  Made for Photo Tag!  Thanks for sharing Acadia!
537937,317271,2008-09-12,5,"What a winner you have here Amber.  I think the best part for me was the addition of the Almond butter.  I used the natural kind that I buy from Costco.  I thought I would have to add some type of sweetner, but after tasting it, it didn't need a thing more.  I used raspberries instead of cherries, but I""m sure any type of fruit would be excellent.  Like I say, it was the almond butter for me, but then again, I'm a p.b. freak!!!  I'm so glad I tagged this for PRMR.!~"
37449,317271,2008-10-28,5,I used Raisin Bran and so enjoyed this cereal! I used dried cherries and loved the addition of the almond butter! Thanks for a great  breakfast!
388414,211234,2007-10-20,4,"So Quick, Basic Ingredients, Healthy, and it still tastes good!!! Used 2 Activia Strawberry yogurts, one cup of whole organic milk, and 2 ripened naners... YUMMY.. 

Thanks for a quick treat that I can make almost all the time due to the ingredients always being on hand.."
124228,70919,2004-01-31,4,"Fast, tasty and easy to make!  A great source of vitamin C.  Healthy and colorful addition to a meal.  "
130219,70919,2008-02-06,4,"Bergy this is sure one healthy, vitamin packed salad. The pickled beets turned all my salad pickle beet color, but it was tasty and different. I would NEVER have thought of putting pickled beets in my cabbage apple salad! I think I prefer to have my beets solo but this was something different to try and I liked it. Thanks for posting."
51011,235428,2007-07-06,4,"Cooking pork tenderloin has become one of our favorite meals because there is enough for us to have dinner, and lunch the next day.  I loved how quick this recipe came together.  I did use fresh garlic instead of powder, and did not use onion powder.  I also had to use a bit more oil.  My oven took longer to cook the pork- about 45 minutes.  Also, the oregano was a bit overwhelming, but I liked it.  Thanks for sharing!"
38643,235428,2007-08-06,4,"Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  I am not a fan of thyme so I reduced the amount to 1 teaspoon. I also did the same with the oregano. The taste was perfect. As the previous reviewer stated, my oven took longer to cook-about 50 minutes."
441396,235428,2007-12-12,5,"I loved the seasoning in this recipe. I added 1 cup of water and omitted the oil to cook the tenderloin in the crockpot. It was delicious. Even my two youngest (and pickiest) eaters gobbled it up. 
I used the juices and liquid in that were left in the crockpot for a wonderful homemade vegetable soup."
609132,235428,2008-04-04,4,This was very good and easy to make.  The spices were very good and the pork was very tender.  I had to cook mine for about 40 minutes to be done.
800399,235428,2009-02-27,4,"This is very good, though the spices were a bit overpowering.  Now I either use a larger pork tenderloin or cut the spices in half.  I serve it with Parmesan or Garlic mashed potatoes, and it's a delicous and easy WW meal!"
280271,235428,2009-11-15,5,We loved this. We didn't feel that the spices were over powering. The pork came out very moist and tender. This is so easy to prepare. I normally grill my pork tenderloin but this is a wonderful recipe for when it isn't grill weather. I served it with recipe #35944 keeping with the thyme theme and recipe #255385. Thanks for posting. :)
632249,235428,2009-12-16,4,Quick to put together and very good flavour. I will make this again. Thx Holly.
665681,235428,2010-03-03,5,"This recipe is a staple in our house. The spices are delicious. We don't think they are overpowering, but our kids do, so we usually peel off the seasoning portion for them and everyone's happy."
812096,235428,2011-01-05,4,This recipe is just what I was looking for!  Very good.  With the new Points Plus it is 4 points per serving.
397051,194900,2006-12-17,5,"So easy, so good, inexpensive and it works well with asparagus too."
230557,194900,2007-01-12,4,"I used 2 cans of green beans with 1T of balsamic vinegar.  It's probably much better with fresh beans, but it dressed up the canned ones nicely."
353579,194900,2007-01-19,4,"Yummy beans!  DH was quite impressed.  Next time I might use a tad less vinegar and a bit more parmesan.  Thanks so much for a new, easy and interesting way to serve green beans!"
133174,194900,2008-04-07,4,I used a 16 bag of frozen cut green beans.  The balsamic vinegar could be reduced to 2 tablespoons but the cheese is perfect.  I will need to try these again with fresh beans or as suggested asparagus.
383346,194900,2008-08-17,4,I used only 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar.  I liked that it was cooked in the microwave.  I had to add 5 minutes to the cooking time.  I'll try again with another cheese like cheddar or mozza.  Thanks Alskann.  Made for Alphabet chef game
881774,194900,2008-11-30,0,I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and my family did not like them at all.
378553,194900,2013-01-22,5,"To cut calories I didn't use the cheese, so I added some garlic and heb seasoning instead and these were very good. I used 16 oz. of frozen  haricot verts so I cooked them a couple of minutes longer. I'm sure with the cheese they'll be even better!"
704950,332367,2008-10-23,5,"Absolutely fabulous!  I used tomatillos mixed in with red tomatoes because I wanted to try this today and there were no green tomatoes to be found!  I used 2 large red tomatoes and 2 large tomatillos.  The tomatillos mimicked the tart green tomato so I could get the flavors.  I also used shredded parmesan instead of cheddar. Since I used parmesan, I only put in 1/2 tsp salt to the spice mixture.  I know those are some pretty big changes but I had the french bread pieces to use up and I loved having this recipe for them! This bakes up wonderfully and looks great in the casserole dish when served!  I will definitely make this again and again with green or red tomatoes!!  Thanks for posting!!"
4439,332367,2012-01-19,5,"beyond fantastic. i am going to use more tomatoes and a little more bread!!! we loved it.<br/>after it was done, i sprinkle some goat cheese crumbles on top, perfect final touch. sorry I forgot the stars in the first review."
17803,139471,2007-02-03,4,"This was a nice light treat we enjoyed the other night.  After cutting the pears in half we also cut off a sliver of pear from the bottom, so they would sit flat in the baking dish.  I liked the slight salty sweet  taste from the butter in combination with the orange honey mixture.  Very easy to make.  Thank you for sharing."
546010,225805,2008-01-18,5,"This is a wonderful appetizer. Salty, sweet & crunchy all at the same time! What more cold you ask for?!  Thanks!"
49304,102058,2004-10-26,5,"Great crepes, I served them with Apircot Jam, also a Caramel Sauce Yummy. Made them just like the recipe said, didn't change a thing. Perfect crepes, Don't let the amount of steps scare you. Easy to make, just don't use over the 2 tablespoons  of batter when cooking the crepes. That you Sharon, for posting a good healthy crepe recipe."
167225,102058,2004-12-30,5,"Ohhh delicious. Tender and perfect. I thought I was going to freeze some for future meals, but it is so easy to eat crepes for every meal and snack (really easy, with these) that that did not happen. I've filled them with butter and sugar, apricot jam, and creamed spinach (not all together) and I'll have to make them again to try mushrooms, or ham, cheese and egg, etc. etc."
88099,102058,2005-01-12,5,"These were awesome.  I went and bought an 8"" heavy duty no stick skillet (couldn't find a 7"" or a crepe pan) to make these and followed your instructions to the tee.  The instructions were flawless and the timing was right on the mark.  I have never made crapes before.  I used the whole wheat flour.  Wonderful recipe.  Can't wait to experiment with this one.  Thanks."
65056,102058,2005-01-26,5,"Wonderful!  I chose the blender method to make these, which was just so easy.  After I first mixed this up, I was very concerned because the batter was just so thin, I thought it would never work.  But, it thickened up enough after the rest period to make perfect tender and lacy crepes.  I don't think anyone would suspect these are made with whole wheat flour and they are just delicious.  I used most of them to make Cauliflower Mornay Crepes  #91207, but I've still got a couple left that I am dreaming of fillings for.  Easy to make, especially with your blender and very much worth it.  Wonderful clear and exact directions.  Just terrific.  A real keeper!  Thanks for another winner, Sharon!"
121185,102058,2006-03-24,5,"Perfect crepes!  We filled ours with cottage cheese, sourcream,pow. sug and topped with strawberries - Soooooo good!!!"
356867,102058,2006-09-26,1,"Worst crepes Ive EVER made, dont taste good, they stick to the pan, and they rip easily. Wanted to try a new recipe, but this one is definately not my favorite. "
327711,102058,2007-01-22,5,These were great.  I didn't let them set for an hour (the kids wanted them now) and they still turned out great.  I filled them with fresh berrys and cool whip.  Since they had whole wheat and eggs I didn't feel bad about the cool whip!  I used a wok to cook and none stuck!
171790,102058,2008-04-08,5,"These crepes are fantastic. I made most of them with a crepe maker. They turned out light and airy with a hint of butter flavour. I made a few in a frying pan, and while they weren't as thin as those made with the crepe maker they still were wonderful. I had no problems with sticking using either method. I didn't even grease the frying pan."
899574,102058,2008-07-22,5,Great recipe. Crepes were firm and even. Nobody was able to tell they were Whole wheat.
519256,102058,2008-08-02,3,"These didn't turn out that well for me. My batter settled a lot during the hour it set. The first 3 crepes turned into scrambled pancakes and the last 5 or so (I only got about 8 out of the batter) were way too heavy on the whole wheat flour and were tough. Not sure if my method was off, but I would not recommend this recipe for beginners."
873985,102058,2009-01-24,5,"WOW!!! THese are INCREDIBLE!! And good for you! Low Calorie, whole wheat...can't get better than that!
I didn't have an hour to wait for the batter to sit so I blendid it all in my Magic Bullet and popped it in the freezer for 20 minutes which worked like a charm! The crepes came out beyond perfect! And so delicious!!!"
1206575,102058,2009-03-17,5,Excellent. Easy. Fun to make. Great to eat.
1141280,102058,2009-04-17,4,"These were pretty good! The reasons I gave these a 4:
the butter did not seem to blend completely... There were tiny chunks of butter in the batter, even after beating the mixture and letting it set. Did anyone else experience this? Also, it's not necessary to butter the pan as the butter in the batter made the crepes easy to lift off the pan."
1024401,102058,2009-05-28,5,Recette absolument merveilleuse! ma famille et moi enjoyed these immensely! made a lovely alternative breakfast! made for the chow hounds for ZWT5!
283834,102058,2009-05-31,5,"These were really good and really easy to put together. Not hard to cook up, even though I was afraid they were going to be. I just made them plain and sprinkled a little sugar/cinnamon mixture over them and we all scrummed them up! Thanks! Made for ZWT5 - Jammin Java Jivers"
869532,102058,2009-06-08,4,"I made this for lunch today and thought they were pretty good. The butter didn't completely dissolve, so next time I'll melt it first. 
We had them with Gruyere cheese and some for dessert with grand manier and cinnamon sugar and Nutella.They were nice and fluffy. Made for zwt5."
719083,102058,2009-06-09,5,"These were easy and delicious! I cooked these on a griddle and just had to use my spatula to keep them in place and more circular. I will definitely be using this recipe to make crepes again! Made for ZWT5, Dining Daredevils."
142367,102058,2009-08-19,5,"I love that these use whole wheat and yet were as yummy as white flour crepes.  We did not let the mix stand and had no issues.

Thank you for sharing!"
738870,102058,2010-02-13,5,These were wonderful.  Thanks for a healthier version of crepes.  My family loved it and I will be making these again!
683416,102058,2010-05-05,5,were great!!!
1622945,102058,2010-05-27,5,"I added just a pinch of vanilla extract, and a packet of Sun Crystals.  I won't be making regular crepes again because this tastes just the same."
814986,102058,2010-07-20,4,"I made a double batch of this recipe to use in manicotti and followed the recipe exactly as written.  The whole wheat flour gives a nutty taste to the crepes, and though I don't think it mattered for my final product, I have to disagree with other reviewers who said there wasn't a noticeable difference between ""traditional"" and whole wheat crepes.  My picky eaters went for the manicotti, draped with bechamel and marinara, but preferred my usual recipe for dessert crepes with only lemon and sugar.<br/><br/>These were, for better or worse, probably the most tender crepes I have ever made.  They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious and helped me keep the manicotti from being dense and heavy, which I loved.  They were also sort of a challenge in the pan, which I didn't love.  They ripped easily and required a very light touch when filling them - just spreading the cheese mix onto the crepes was likely to tear them.<br/><br/>Overall, I am likely to make these again to try to get more whole grains into my family's diet, but they won't be my only crepe recipe.   And next time, I'll make sure to use a feather-light touch from the get-go to minimize ""kitchen taster"" mistakes."
795897,102058,2011-01-29,5,Eggy and delicious!
945269,102058,2011-05-06,5,"These are easy to whip up and so delicious!  I sometimes slather with butter and maple syrup.  Other times make a fruit sauce for the top with whipped cream, and other times I just slather with butter and sprinkle with confectionary sugar or cinnamon and sugar.  Delicious any old way!  Thanks - Dave"
341324,102058,2011-09-07,0,"Buttery, tender, and easy to work with! I melted the butter before trying to incorporate it and added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and an extra tablespoon of flour. I will definitely make these again, next time with pumpkin pie spice in the crepe and a maple cream cheese filling."
268689,102058,2012-01-22,5,"This recipe worked really well. The second time I tried to make it I used Egg Beaters and had trouble with the crepes getting too crispy. So, I added a couple more tablespoons of melted butter. (I wouldn't recommend that substitution to others though - stick with the original recipe.)"
2190117,102058,2012-05-10,5,Thank you for a very easy to make healthy alternative to regular crepes. This is now my official crepe recipe.
2272899,102058,2012-05-24,5,"These are so good! My first time making crepes, I was worried they would be hard to make but these were easier than pancakes :) <br/><br/>@Kath2226 reread step 8, you didn't stir after chilling :)"
224088,102058,2012-05-26,1,"I am baffled by the numerous positive reviews.  I made the recipe as directed, with 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour (!?!) and let it stand for 1 hour.  I've made crepes many times and was expecting a thin batter, but this batter was no where near thick enough.  I had to add a lot of white flour at the last minute.  Has some change been made to the recipe???"
2326253,102058,2012-07-12,1,"Having just come back from France, I was really excited to use this recepy but rather disappointed by the taste. I followed the ingredients exactly, only substituting vegetable oil for butter due to not having any at the moment. The cr?pes tasted way too eggy. I like my cr?pes to taste more neutral, so that I can eat them salty or sweet, depending on what I want to eat them with. The egg flavor would mask any other flavor from the filling. I had to add more milk and whole wheat flour, as well as a bit of agave and salt. They came out significantly better and no longer eggy.<br/><br/>The original recipe also had a very thin consistency. I like my cr?pes to fold without breaking, so more flour should do the job. <br/><br/>Another tip: make sure your pan is oiled after each cr?pe and that your heat doesn't go too high so that they don't get crispy but remain soft."
1378827,102058,2012-11-13,5,Perfect!  I make my crepes in the blender and they always turn out great.  This is a nice light  eggy recipe for using whole wheat flour.
2804113,102058,2013-04-28,5,"I have never made a crepe recipe where the first one turned out perfectly, but this one did!  It is my new go-to for crepes.  Can&#039;t wait to try it with manicotti!  I also melted the butter.  I didn&#039;t understand how you were supposed to incorporate it if it was cold.  Worked perfectly.  I also added a bit more flour as they seemed a little thin."
632249,102058,2013-06-12,5,"This is a great recipe for low carbers! I assumed that the butter was to be melted so went with that and it worked out perfectly. I made a pizza style filling for my daughter&#039;s lunch, and she loved it. I can&#039;t wait to experiment with more fillings! Thanks for sharing this!"
186468,102058,2013-06-26,5,"Trying eat cleaner but still enjoy favorites, I chose this recipe because of the whole wheat flour. I made the recipe with a few changes; used almond milk instead of regular milk, and added a touch of vanilla. We had them with fresh strawberries from the garden and ate the entire recipe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are a bit more &quot;meaty&quot; than your regular crepe in that they have more texture. I liked it, but it was a funky feeling at first. I&#039;m not sure about them being &quot;too eggy&quot;. They were perfect to me."
191533,102058,2014-01-28,2,"Disappointing. I was happy to see the lower carb content, but it definitely threw the ratios off in this recipe. Definitely a bit more eggy in taste than your typical crepe. Batter was much too runny, even prepared as directed. It wasn&#039;t covering the pan or getting thick enough to even remove from the pan when cooked, so I compensated by using more batter per crepe, and I only got 5  9&quot; crepes. And I forgot the trick of making the batter in a blender- the butter solidified when I added it to the ice-cold milk and eggs, and I had little bits of butter that didn&#039;t mix in with the electric mixer."
1478685,102058,2014-02-25,0,Love this recipe. We have made a few times now. My fianc&eacute; and I try to limit any white flour and products as much as we can so we were happy to find this whole wheat recipe! Honestly we like these a lot more than the traditional white flour crepes.
285039,102058,2014-03-02,4,"This is a very effective recipe. However, I was out of whole wheat flour and since my children like Spelt, I substituted it instead. I had to double the spelt since it isn&#039;t as thick as whole wheat so I used 2/3 instead of the original 1/3. I let the batter sit almost an hour because I had to make accessories and they were thick enough to flip easily. I am not a crepe aficionado so I might have committed a crepe crime with texture and flavor, but my family loved them and that is all that matters when I cook. (I am the husband)"
2001902445,102058,2017-12-31,1,awful should be a recipe for an omlet
2002146147,102058,2018-05-08,0,I am so glad this wasnt my first attempt at making crepes! I would have thought that I just can't make crepes. This batter was like water and very difficult to work with. I ended up with only 3 usable crepes. Dinner will be late today because I have to start over with a different recipe.
58104,69967,2003-09-02,4,Yes very rich and delish. I skip one stick of butter just couldn`t put it all in. I enjoyed the anise flavor.
86318,69967,2004-05-05,5,"This is a lovely cake. I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf in a 5 1/8 cup loaf pan, but retained all the recipe's ingredients and proportions. Thank you very much for this recipe."
305531,166749,2011-05-06,5,Good potatoes. Hard to believe that these haven't been reviewed before now. Simple and good. Thanks ElishevaH for sharing. Made for Bargain Basement Tag.
135566,166749,2011-06-27,5,Yummy baked potatoes.  I did sprinkle Molly McButter butter-flavored seasoning on my potato before topping with the sour cream mixture. I also used light sour cream to cut back on the fat.
63128,3667,2004-10-11,4,"This was good but the cheese/egg filling kind of got lost and didn't add the cheesecake type layer I was hoping for. I also couldn't figure out the point of sauteeing the apple mixture before baking it. I would have given it only three stars, but my husband (Mr. Sweet Tooth) seemed to enjoy it more than me, so four seemed right."
424680,48738,2009-10-11,5,"Absolutely ~ Dip, sauce, spread: All great! I made a double batch (used Fuji apples) & when all was finished, I divided the conserve in half & added a small amount of cranberry juice to one portion, making a thick syrup that we enjoyed on pancakes! Definitely a keeper recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adopted orphans in the current Pick A Chef]"
179133,48738,2010-12-17,5,"This is very nice! I used Pink Lady apples, 1/2 cup superfine sugar, and an extra 1/2 cup cranberries (I needed to use them up). I was afraid the apples wouldn't be cooked after the allotted time, but they were perfect. I'll probably just end up eating this all by itself it's so good, rather than *on* anything! Thanks for sharing!"
383853,280184,2008-09-14,5,"WOW!  These are super yummy.  I've always heard souffles are hard to make, so I've never attempted one, but come on...bacon...cheese...how could i resist this one?  It was so good!  It wasn't nearly as hard as I expected to make either.  I never got my flour, butter, milk mixture to boil, but it was getting super thick so I just took it off the heat after waiting for quite some time...but they turned out great anyway.  I only have a regular small muffin tin, I would love to make these again in jumbo tins.  I'll have to go out and buy one.  Great recipe and easy to make!  This is a keeper.  Thanks CoffeeB!"
88099,280184,2009-02-28,4,Very good.  Mine sank in when I removed them from the oven.  Not sure what I did wrong.  But the flavor was very good.  Thanks for sharing.
2349259,280184,2012-08-02,5,"This is a very good recipe. It was my first try at making a souffle. The only thing I did different was add onion. Wow, very yummy. I would like to make it in a bigger dish and wondered if anybody would know what or if I needed to alter the time to or the oven temp."
65502,280184,2012-09-08,5,"Great flavour, very easy to make and something that I would attempt again. I made this as directly but they collapsed as soon as I gently removed them from the oven. My oven light doesn't work so it could have been because I had to open the oven door to check in on their progress. They didn't look as nice but they tasted very good! Made for Went To The Market tag game. Thanks CoffeeB! :)"
2001933446,280184,2018-01-17,5,"omg so good the two of us ate them all!. I had a few pieces of bacon left and some eggs and ive never made a souffl&eacute; but googled it and got this! It was very thick like dough and i thought i did it wrong but when i added the eggs it loosened up. It says bring to a boil but its weird to boil dough... either way i followed the directions and it came out killer. my gf said it was fluffy and delicious but recommended adding jalapenos. I thought it would be good with spinach, i will try the variations in the future. great recipe and fun :)"
2002061258,280184,2018-03-18,0,"If I serve this for bridge to 3 tables of 4 players each table (12 persons) for lunch, what might I serve with it?"
745372,363536,2011-01-08,5,"Delicious!  The bacon and drippings made the brussels sprouts palatable, even enjoyable.  Thanks for sharing!"
199848,363536,2009-07-17,4,"Brussels sprouts happen to be my favorite veggie.  I thought this was very good as written, but then I made it adding chopped onions and a little garlic and it was out of this world!  The cider vinegar really gives a wonderful finishing touch.  I had petite brussels sprouts so there was no need to cut them in halves.  Thanx for a great new recipe for my favorite veggie!"
369715,363536,2010-04-15,4,This was good and easy to make. We all enjoyed it as written. Made for Spring PAC 2010.
428060,363536,2011-11-25,5,"This gets a full five stars, it was my favorite dish for Thanksgiving. I had to add butter while I was cooking the sprouts, and I cooked them until they started to caramelize."
143721,364404,2010-04-20,4,I was concerned when I was how much oil this recipe called for!  Very easy to put together.  We thought the bottom crust was somewhat doughy.  I would suggest prebaking the bottom crust than adding the remaining ingredients. The topping was perfect.  Made for Spring PAC 2010.
383346,374082,2009-08-29,3,It gave the steak a nice taste but something was missing.  There is not enough of balsamic vinegar.  I'd try with more next time.  I let the steak  in the marinade for 2 hours.  Thanks Ice Cool Kitty :)  Made for Photo tag
65502,374082,2010-06-10,4,"This was great on Recipe #385538, the beef version! I did make a significant change which is why I took a star away. I tried it as listed and couldn't taste the balsamic vinegar, so I used 1/4 cup of it. I'm wondering if that was supposed to be the amount listed because what was there does not equal 3/4 cup. It was great with that amount and not overpowering! I also used the fresh thyme. Made for ZWT6. Thanks Ice Cool Kitty! :)"
560807,269443,2007-12-03,5,"I just tried this tonight. Sis and I were looking for something to pour over our fries for our li'l movie night, and this was perfect. I made a little too much, so when the fries were over, we just scooped the rest of the sauce and ate that plain! I added a bit of Tabasco sauce for an added kick, and it turned out great! Thanks a lot!"
63807,71172,2004-02-23,5,A huge hit with my kids! Thanks for sharing!
51109,71172,2004-06-27,5,"I made this while on vaction with friends.  It was a 5 on all counts...easy, tasty, and appealed to everyone. I served it with purchased garlic toast, but will make homemade next time.  Thanks for sharing."
177085,71172,2005-03-28,5,"This was devine! I served it with breadsticks seasoned with recipe #109314 and it was great. The family loved it, will make again! "
206357,71172,2005-07-12,5,This was a great dish.  I will definitly use it again.  My family and friends loved it. Thanks for sharing!
102064,71172,2005-08-22,5,I served this with cannelloni for dinner on Sunday. My stepsons loved it. It was a great dish and it will be served again. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.
220403,71172,2006-02-06,5,"I took this to a Super Bowl party yesterday and it was quickly devoured!  I didn't get to try any, but it was given rave reviews by kids and adults alike!  I served it alongside fresh breadsticks.  It was quick to put together.  Thanks!!"
222564,71172,2006-02-21,4,"Yummy. Made this with chopped white onion and added a little salt. Could have doubled the oregano. Great with garlic bread, though little on the rich side. If worried about that, crisp fresh baguet will do nicely along."
822032,71172,2008-09-14,5,"I made this pizza dip for breakfast this morning. Haha. In my defense I am pregnant, but man it is deeeelish! And very easy to make!"
37636,71172,2008-12-07,5,Goes great with breadsticks or slices of freshly baked baguette. Perfect for teenagers or lovers of Italian food. Thanks for sharing! ~Sue
233616,71172,2009-01-06,5,"Thanks for a great addition to my holiday party. People really liked this recipe. I made no changes, and I served mine with cut up pita bread - very pizza-crust like, if you think about it!"
628779,71172,2009-05-25,5,Great as usual. The kid's really liked this and  the adults kept going back for more too. Thanks for sharing Kitten
625696,71172,2010-01-01,4,"People seemed to either really like or not care for it very much.  Personally, I really liked it!  Its very flavorful.  I stirred some cheese into the cream cheese/sour cream mix, then topped with some more cheese.  I would make it again for myself, just scale it down.  Thanks!"
844554,425464,2010-05-23,5,This turned out wonderful for us! I cut the recipe in half and it worked great. Made for Newest Zaar Tag Game 2010.
280271,425464,2010-05-30,4,This is really good but next time I think I will use half the amount of lemon juice. It seemed just a bit too much. I added extra horseradish because we enjoy the heat. Thanks for posting. :)
179133,425464,2010-07-02,5,I've never made cocktail sauce with mayo in it so I enjoyed this change. Made exactly to the recipe. Thanks for sharing!
3861,647,2002-09-16,4,"I finally made this recipe (been sitting on it all summer) and it really is ""Awesome"". I didn't stray too much from recipe except I added about a half cup of raisins. I too cooked it at 325 F but used two foil pans and cooked it for 90 minites. Two thumbs up Johnson!!! I bet dried cranberries would be a good addition...hmmmm"
33588,647,2005-03-15,5,"Great bread,thanks.Linda"
289319,647,2006-11-27,4,"Great bread, just a bit on the sweet side for me though. That is just a matter of personal taste though.  I think I may cut the sugar back next time and see if I that helps.  I did substitute half of the oil for applesauce and the bread was still quit moist.  I will be giving these as Chritmas gifts and it is SUCH a nice change from the typical banana bread.  :)"
233583,647,2007-02-05,5,"Marg-  AWESOME, DELECTABLE, as DS said, ""best bread I have made in forever!"" So if I could give you 10+ stars I would.
The house smells wonderful and homey and the taste just quietly explodes in your mouth as you taste all the flavors and the textures. I cut the sugar to 1 1/3 cups for dietary reasons and it came out fabulous.  All else was followed as you wrote.  I cooked for 95 minutes at 325, (time probably increased due to the -25 degrees outside) The tops were crunchy and the inside was moist and delicious.  
I can go on and on.  Everyone should try this.  It is a keeper and will be a regular from now on!"
380081,647,2007-02-23,5,"This has to be the best bread recipe I have ever used.  My husband is not a fruit bread kinda guy, but he ate almost 1/2 a loaf.

THANKS for such a keeper!!!"
185446,647,2007-04-19,5,"I halved the recipe, and it yielded one nice loaf.  Thanks for an easy and tasty bread.  It will surely be made again."
167534,647,2007-06-29,5,"This really is awesome!

I've made this before, but apparently, I never rated it.

Last time I used this recipe it was to make muffins. I left out the walnuts (I don't like 'em) and added a bit of milk (one or two tablespoons) to be able to get the batter into the muffin tins. I baked them for 30 minutes at about 375F (sorry, forgot to make a note of the temperature, so no guarantees) and they came out delicious. My sister even said that they were about as good as the chocolatey things I baked - and coming from her, that means a lot! :)

(As a side-node: my apples were pretty much regular-sized and yielded one cup of diced apple each.)"
138429,647,2007-08-23,5,"I have been on a Apple Bread kick lately and finding this recipe  rang true to it name.  So  moist with great flavor.  I baked it at 350 for 70 minutes.  Great recipe,thank-you."
104295,647,2007-09-02,4,"Nice bread.  I did have to leave the walnuts out due to the fact that I'm using up what's in the pantry before the move.  I liked the fact that it is fullof apple, I think the kids would have preferred a little less fruit.  Very moist and tender."
55589,647,2007-10-15,5,"Great recipe!  Very sweet though, even though I decreased the amount of sugar slightly.  I'll just consider it a dessert instead of a ""healthy"" apple bread."
166294,647,2007-10-19,5,"This was like a little taste of apple pie in a bread.  Delicious!  I used half oil and half applesauce and it's very moist.  I was glad I didn't halve the recipe as I had intended to do because we went through one loaf in one lunch between the 6 of us. And you're right, the ends are just as tasty.  It was a yummy way to use some of our orchard apples."
484613,647,2007-10-21,5,"this is a great recipe!  Loved by all!  
I substituted pecans for walnuts and added 1/2 tsp. of apple pie spice to give a bit more zip.  Yummy!"
620435,647,2007-11-11,5,"This bread was very good.  Everyone enjoyed it and I will make it again.  I used bread flour and baked at 325 degrees for 70 minutes.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I also posted 2 pictures, one with the batter in the pans and one when they were done.  Thanks again for a great recipe."
159559,647,2007-11-13,5,Very tasty and moist - a nice change from banana bread :) A definate keeper - thanks!!!
231951,647,2007-12-17,5,"Made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. My son even goes, this is better then a co-workers of his. That is a true compliment coming from him, due to the fact that he's still a picky eater. Very easy to make. Can use any apples, I used Empire."
373083,647,2007-12-30,5,"Made 3 batches of this for christmas baskets, but used small pans.  Snuck 1 for myself, it was awesome.  I added a streusel toppong on half of them.  Delish both ways!  Great recipe!"
103628,647,2008-01-21,5,"Incredibly moist, rich, and yummy.  Easy to make, too!  So it's not terribly healthy...but it's sooooo tasty!  Next time I think I'll try using applesauce and add more walnuts than called for (I like walnuts).  Thanks for such a great recipe!"
753332,647,2008-02-05,5,"I made a half recipe -- just one loaf. I wanted to make it more healthy for my kids, so for the flour I used one third white flour, one third whole wheat flour and one third wheat germ. It came out fantastic. The kids love it and it's SOOOOO good."
443633,647,2008-04-27,5,Very good.  I used 1/2 ww & 1/2 white flour.
316523,647,2008-05-06,5,"Absolutely wonderful!!  So moist and tasty.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white, and also used half oil and half apple sauce.  It turned out soooo good and is definetely a recipe to keep for years!"
230102,647,2008-09-18,5,"This turned out great!  I sent it with my husband to a Monday night meeting and it was gobbled down.  The recipe didn't specify pan size, so I used 9 x5.  The loaves weren't too scant, but I will try it again with an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 and see if I like it better.  I also used granny smith apples.  I think next time, I will look for a not so tart apple.  We just bought some ginger golds at Costco and they are really delicious.  I think I'll try them!  Of course, I used the full cup oil and it was wonderful.  Had to leave the walnuts out because I didn't have them, but will have them on hand for the next time.  Mine was done in about an hour at 325 degrees, but my oven runs hot.  Time also might change if I use a smaller pan.  Marg, thanks for another great recipe and also for the specific baking time and temperature that you use!"
996271,647,2008-10-20,5,I've made this bread twice now! It truly is awsome apple bread. Thanks for the recipe!
854020,647,2008-10-28,5,"this recipe is fantastic - i use coarse sea salt and extra walnuts - the result is salty, sweet, and disappears quickly."
1019036,647,2008-11-17,5,Awesome recipe! I made one loaf with walnuts and one without.  Both turned out beautiful!
583931,647,2008-11-24,5,Fabulous!  All 4 of my children and my picky husband loved this bread.  I used freshly milled flour and apple pie spice (instead of just cinnamon) and it was DELICIOUS.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!!
883184,647,2008-12-28,5,"This has become a family favorite in our house.  Very yummy and makes emough to share.  Freezes well, and works great in large or mini loaves.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
1118402,647,2009-01-08,5,"This bread is Awesome.  The whole family loves it and it is very moist and delicious.  It has replaced the usual banana bread that I always make.  I added 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice and I have never added nuts to this bread.  It is delicious.  I also baked the bread at 325 degrees for 60 to 70 minutes.  It does freeze very well, I just got a loaf out of the freezer from August, over 4 months ago, and it was just as good as being freshly baked.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!"
1146004,647,2009-01-26,5,"Made it last night and the response was that it really is awesome apple bread! I substituted on stick melted margarine for the oil and added vanilla, doubled the cinnamon and used 3 apples. delicious."
486648,647,2009-01-27,5,"Marg, this is really great bread! I cut most of the oil out (used applesauce) and added some dried cranberries instead of all the nuts (half and half). I made one loaf and 18 muffins. Thanks so much for this Awesome recipe!"
1267955,647,2009-05-14,5,"Very good, i added extra apple though...will make again!"
1194254,647,2009-09-01,5,"Will make this again!!  Like Bob, I also added rasins.  I also thought of maybe adding a mashed banana to it next time."
1400691,647,2009-10-01,5,i used apple sauce instead of oil and mixed the cinnamon and sugar in together with it. it was great. i also added a small handful of finely chopped nuts and a cup of raisins. i am saying it ws great but it is only a guess since i made it in the morning and it was gone when i went to get a slice later that day. kids never even left a crimb.
165501,647,2009-10-03,5,"Exceptionally good!  Since I didn't have applesauce to replace some of the oil, I just decreased it by 1/4 cup (cake is still very moist).  Used a cup of dark brown sugar and half a cup of white, about four cups of apples, half a cup of ground flax seeds, half white and half whole wheat flour and apple pie spice with a little extra cinnamon.  Had it for breakfast this a.m. with some whipped cream cheese.  This a keeper!"
313943,647,2009-10-30,5,This was wonderful! I made it once as listed (no nuts) and once with half applesauce and half oil. Both times it came out great! Gone before it cools in this house. Neighbors keep asking me to make more. This will definitely be a Christmas gift this year.
1439665,647,2009-11-07,5,"Delicious!  I poured the batter into 5 mini loaf pans.  2 without nuts and 3 with walnuts.  My family loved the ones without the nuts.  My 17 year old son loved it, as well as my husband. :)"
597586,647,2009-11-08,5,"I cut this recipe in half b/c I needed eggs for a breakfast casserole I was making to go with it.  For one loaf I added 2 eggs b/c when I mixed the sugar, oil & vanilla w/ 1 egg it didn't look 'wet' enough to me.  It turned out great w/ 2 eggs for 1 loaf.  Other than that, I made it exactly as directed & it was AWESOME! Wish I had enough eggs to make 2 loaves!"
1054210,647,2010-03-28,5,"So good, I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  I was skeptical of the batter once it was all mixed, it seemed really really thick, and when the apples went in I thought it was way too many apples but I kept with the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  I don't even think I'll make banana bread again unless I have to, this was so good.  I did use some sweet apple sprinkle from pampered chef on top too."
911737,647,2010-06-18,5,"I didn't change anything and it was fantastic. I used a couple of different types of apples because that is all I had, but it still turned out great."
984090,647,2010-09-26,0,"i actually found this on another website first, but i'm glad i can review it here!  this bread is AMAZING.<br/>it tastes really good with 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar also. I also use 4 cups of apples and put it in a 9x13 for an hour on 300.  my FAVORITE way to use up apples."
34025,647,2011-08-11,5,Loved this recipe...it was moist and very tasty...added a drizzle rather than the sugar on top...will definitely make this again...thanks for submitting it.
2427451,647,2012-09-30,5,Absolutely wonderful flavor and texture. I added a dash or two of nutmeg and baked it at the suggested alternative of 325 for 70 min. Came out perfectly!
1179225,647,2014-02-10,5,"We really loved this bread, both flavor and texture. I wasn&#039;t sure if the apples should be peeled so I peeled them. I&#039;m looking forward to making this recipe again, baking in mini bread pans and freezing them to have on hand for a breakfast treat or dessert. Thanks posting the recipe!"
2853299,647,2014-05-18,4,"I made this bread today. It was great, I decrease sugar to 1 2/3 cups, and still taste sweet. And add 3 handful of raisins... The only thing that I don&#039;t like is every bread/cake that I made with baking soda, it will left bitter taste in my tongue."
2000557937,647,2015-10-13,5,Just made this bread yesterday and I had to make more today. I initially made this for my picky eater son for a snack. But once my husband got a hold of it see Ya later. This bread is amazing and the batter is enjoyable as well.
2000692086,647,2015-11-18,5,This is amazing! I definitely will make it again!
1790806,647,2016-10-27,5,I made this yesterday 10.26.2016 my family and I loved it! Will be making it again in the near future! Thanks for the recipe!!
2001506330,647,2017-04-25,4,"Very tasty, everyone loved it. However, I found it to be on the sweet side and I have only used half the amount of sugar!"
1216137,647,2017-07-08,5,I also reduced the sugar by half and added some dried cranberries and have been told that it is the best fruit loaf that they've ever tasted when I made it on Father's Day so I thought I'd bake it again this weekend.
8526,459,2002-12-01,4,"These came out OK, only because my husband had a basic idea of how to make crepes. I'm just wondering about the lack of directions. What kind of pan? Butter or no butter? How much butter? How high should the heat be? How much batter per crepe? Well, we used butter, on a heavy bottom pan, medium high heat and made them very thin. Kept them warm in the oven until they were all done. This recipe made about 15 crepes."
135271,459,2006-02-26,4,My husband now knows this recipe by heart.  Every Sunday morning he treats the family to crepes.  
88378,458,2009-07-08,5,"Excellent crepe recipe!  I am no pro when it comes to crepes, but these were a complete success.  I didn't refrigerate the batter and it did fine using right away.  I used a 10"" skillet, sprayed with nonstick spray.  It also helped to spray my spatula for flipping.  I held these in a baking dish in a warm oven as they came off the heat - and I sprayed between the crepes so they wouldn't stick together.  (Whole lotta sprayin' going on!)  I got 12 crepes.  Filled with a savory curry chicken.  Super good; I'd definitely use this recipe again!!"
1366254,379580,2009-09-20,3,This tasted alot like my teen time spread.. my little sister loved it
27873,16165,2002-01-03,0,"Thank you for a simple alcohol-free recipe for eggnog.  I have not yet tried it, but my son will be delighted!  All the other one's i have seen yet sound great, but I don't like the taste of alcohol...and I am not about to serve it to my 8 yer old.  I will comment when I have made it and past it by the experts (my son and I).  By the way, how long do you suppose it keeps in the fridge?"
516010,16165,2007-07-26,5,yummy
1022977,16165,2008-11-12,5,exellent recipe with pumpkin pie spice and cinnimon spice and i used vanilla ice cream instead of just cream and vanilla
407338,109327,2009-01-29,5,Wonderful recipe for a topping on anything!  Bananas go so well with walnuts. YUMO!!  Prepared for the Cookathon for KelBel January 2009.
133174,109327,2005-01-30,5,Oh my this was awesome!  I have made banana nut pancakes/waffles but not syrup.  It was gone before I knew it.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for posting.
24386,109327,2005-02-23,5,Wonderful idea and so delicious on our French toast this morning.  Used pecans instead of walnuts and will definitely be a do again.  Thanks so much for posting.
89831,109327,2006-04-30,5,"This stuff is way to good, I couldn't keep my spoon out of it lol! I already had my walnuts toasted and frozen so this took minutes to make, it's a definate keeper thanks for sharing kel!...Kitten:)"
107135,109327,2006-05-16,5, i liked this very much on top of the pancakes thank you for posting dee
465056,109327,2007-05-31,5,"I threw the bananas in the blender to make a smooth paste then added the butter and syrup.  I left out the nuts, but used a 1/4 t black walnut flavor.  It made a nice smooth syrup without comments of ""chunks"" in my syrup.

Everyone loved it.  I think this would also be good over ice cream."
294000,109327,2010-09-26,0,Yum!! Used homemade syrup that had some cinnamon in it.  Really made waffles so much better this morning.  Thanks!
186851,436914,2010-09-10,4,"I made these for my cousin who loves bacon with anything!! Oddly enough they are pretty good tasting with the maple syrup together with the bacon. I would imagine once my cousin tries them, I will be making them often.  Too funny!"
1803061096,436914,2014-08-22,5,"I thought these were wonderful! I love the salty - sweet tastes. I make my bacon in the oven, on a baking rack at 375 for 20 min. That makes for the perfect crunchy bacon to these cookies. Definitely stir in the bacon by hand, and bake on parchment paper. 7 minutes was just right at 375 in my oven. Thanks Gina!"
1623450,436914,2015-03-29,5,AWESOME!!  My kids said they smelled like pancakes cooking.  Husband said they tasted like breakfast (Pancakes and bacon).  Very easy and really good
346576,195436,2007-01-09,5,"We had these potatoes for dinner tonight and they were absolutely wonderful!!  Instead of sprinkling the cheese on the layers, I stirred it into the sauce.  Yum!!"
128473,502632,2014-05-05,5,"This was a really lovely sandwich.  It was full of flavor, had excellent textures and was quick and easy to make.  I used a nice fresh Italian Bread, butter, cheddar, bacon and spicy cilantro lime mayonnaise, so good.  I will be enjoying this again, next time I will add a slice of tomato as well, I think it would really compliment the sandwich. Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring Pac 2014."
718118,356257,2009-05-07,5,"I wanted to top a salad with baked tofu, but I didn't want any marinade to compete with the delicious homemade salad dressing. This recipe was perfect! It's nothing fancy, but if you're looking for an easy recipe that delivers texture without all the soy sauce and added ingredients, this is it! Plain, simple, delicious tofu."
223979,173242,2006-06-20,5,"My family enjoyed this.  I tasted it a tiny bit because I do not like bananas and it was quite good.  Very easy, so my kids can do this themselves.  Thanks!"
133174,173242,2006-06-24,4,I reduced the recipe for just the 2 of us.  This is a nice quick recipe and dessert can be on the table in 15 minutes or less.  It is not overly sweet and green tip bananas are a must to keep the bananas from being mushy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
58104,173242,2006-06-27,5,"This is warming, sweet, creamy, tangy, crunchy, and smooth! I made for one using 1/2 a banana, skipped the oj, topped with a pinch of cinnamon."
65197,173242,2006-06-28,5,"This is a wonderful change of pace in our house!!  I rarely do desserts during the week, but this was quick, simple and delicious!!
Thank you"
281701,173242,2006-06-28,5,"Great dessert!  So easy, my 4 year old helped me prepare it!  Not too sweet.  The orange juice gives just the right amount of tang and balances the sweetness of the bananas nicely!  The family loved it!  I recommend using bananas that are a little on the green side."
500860,156441,2007-08-12,5,"OMG!!!!

A deceptively easy recipe that is TOTALLY ADDICTIVE! I could make this every single day. Are hearts of palm even healty? Must research that. Because after this recipe, I'll be eating a LOT more of them.

Don't be tempted to add tomatoes or sause. Just make this as is.

I didn't have garlic salt so used salt and garlic...and just to taste. Also I used dried parsley because I didn't have any on hand.

SO SO SO SO yummy. A great side dish...but not substancial enough to stand on it's own as a main course. Doesn't mean the flavor is anything less than the best though!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!

Thank you Gourmet Grad, this was the surprize dish of the evening!"
512532,156441,2007-08-23,3,This tasted pretty good but it had way too much garlic salt for my taste. Some pieces were unetible because they had concentrated garlic salt. I'd like to try this again with at least half the amount of salt.
616152,156441,2008-02-18,5,This was really good.  I added a few canned & chopped artichoke hearts and a splash of rice wine vinegar.  I'll definitely make this again.
143318,156441,2008-09-03,3,"Love the idea of this - what a unique and easy side dish for any day, a holiday or potluck. Even in Florida we only see hearts of palm served cold. This recipe is too salty; even my saltaholic husband could barely eat it. I will be glad to update the stars in my review if you reduce the garlic salt to 1 tsp.  I used a 14 oz. can and would say this serves two as a side dish - it would only be for four if there were several side dishes. I would like to try this again with other flavors, like replacing the garlic salt with fresh garlic and lemon."
1056692,156441,2013-09-27,4,"Really good side. I didn&#039;t measure anything, just drizzled oil then sprinkled the other ingredients over the top then tossed it all together. I did add some broccoli before baking. Very good with baked chicken. Thanks for sharing!"
47510,308221,2012-03-03,5,"What a wonderful flavor sensation!  I precooked the bacon so it would be done at the same time as the shrimp.  After assembling the shrimp, pineapple and bacon, I sprinkled a bit of Old Bay over them.  Because I was cooking so many, I popped them in the oven at 350 degrees until done.  I served the shrimp with a spicy remoulade dipping sauce."
463435,420761,2010-04-29,5,Made this the other day for dessert. It was fantastic! I usually just top angle food cake with strawberries however the addition of the other berries makes it so much better. I will definitely make this again. Thanks  for sharing this recipe. Made and reviewed for the April-May Potluck Tag.
163688,7311,2004-10-28,0,"this is definately not bavarian potatoe salad. we don't use lemon juice!! If you want authentic, you might want to try another recipe."
153188,7311,2005-05-11,5,"With so few ingredients I was iffy about what this was going to taste like.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved the lemon taste, and the salt and pepper, along with the sugar, gave it a nice texture, it was amazingly good, and it will definitely be made again!"
111600,7311,2006-10-30,5,"My brother and I planned a German themed dinner for my mom's birthday.  My mom was absolutely thrilled with this potato salad and kept saying that it tasted just like her German grandma used to make.  My brother, who lived in Germany for fifteen years said that it had an authentic German taste.  My only suggestion is to double the recipe because it is so good you want everyone to be able to have a helping or two!  It was a hit. Thanks for sharing!"
60992,7311,2007-08-13,5,FANTASTIC! I have been missing my best friends potato salad (she is from the Stutgart area of Germany) and this recipe is the closest to hers I have found. First if all according to my friend in America the only potatoes that come close to the ones they use in Germany are Yukon Golds. I also used veggie broth in place of the chicken broth and kept about 1/4c. of it to mix in with the oil. Instead of vegetable oil I used Enova and it was perfect. Per Edith I subbed white vinegar for the lemon juice and used about 2 teaspoons more than 2 tablespoons. I added about half of a very thinly sliced peeled English cucumber and some fresh minced chives. We were in heaven. According to my friend this potato salad should NEVER be refrigerated and you must finish it by the following day or throw it out. To me this is the perfect way to make potato salad. Thank you SO much for posting.
267323,7311,2007-09-26,5,"My DS said this tasted just like a potato salad that he enjoyed during a recent visit to Berlin, Germany. He liked it so much that he now wants to learn how to make it on his own.  I also made it again with a little onion powder for another DS who loathes raw onions; he raved about how good it was and asked for it again. This was very easy to make. We will use this recipe often. Thank you for posting this."
163872,7311,2007-11-03,5,"Incredible!  I made this and another German-style potato salad a few weeks ago for our annual Oktoberfest celebration in our home.  Those who have been to Germany loved this one best, including The Beau; those who have never been to Germany kept coming back for seconds and thirds of this one too.  I won't wait until our next Oktoberfest to make again, wonderful flavour and a new favourite for me.  I used Yukons based on another reviewer's recommendation and tripled the recipe because we were having so many people over.  I didn't realize I was out of vegetable oill and just subbed grapeseed oil, turned out fabulous."
226867,7311,2008-08-10,4,"Liked this a lot, although my 
DH, friend and I all added salt. Used olive oil cause it's more diet-friendly! It is a lot like my Tante Frieda's Swabian potato salad (different region of Germany). Thanks!"
125640,7311,2008-09-14,3,"Very easy to make, unfortunately my family wasn't so sure about it. It seemed like it needed something flavor-wise, definitely extra salt and maybe some basil and/or garlic? Probably better quality broth would have helped at any rate. Thanks."
185139,7311,2008-11-07,3,I think this needed more salt or something.  This seems pretty authentic but it wasn't the best potato salad I've ever had.  We enjoyed it though with Nurenburger bratwurst.  It was a good match!
462821,7311,2009-04-15,0,"This is NOT an authentic Bavarian recipe! For true Bavarian potato salad, potatoes are boiled whole (water is fine, broth is not necessary), and then peeled and sliced (not too thinly) while still hot. Just let them cool slightly until you can bear to handle them. The salad is then immediately dressed with several table spoons of boiling water, (olive) oil and vinegar (NOT lemon juice - BTW 2 TBS won't season much) and plenty of salt and pepper. NO sugar! The potatoes need to be hot to soak in all the flavor. The salad is usually decorated with hard boiled eggs cut into wedges. Onions and thinly sliced cucumbers are usually served on the side so people can mix them into the salad as they like it."
252816,102171,2005-12-11,5,"We love squash cooked this way. I have also halved the squash,microwave till done. mix all ingredients,pour over squash,brown slightly in oven.Great way of serving squash..."
340141,24360,2006-09-01,5,"I made this in the crockpot with a Kraft honey BBQ sauce.  The flavor is outstanding.  I can only think that it will be even better made stovetop so that the sauce reduces a more; can't wait until cool weather to try again.  As for prep, it is SO simple.  "
59790,36217,2003-06-06,4,"This cake turned out very dense and chewy, more like a brownie.  The molasses flavor was very strong the first day, but mellowed out as the days went on.  It was very tasty, and even better served with something creamy like vanilla ice cream or yogurt.  A little hint though, make sure to use soft butter, and cream with the sugar before adding other ingredients!"
168896,36217,2007-05-18,5,"very nice and easy recipe.  had no baking soda so i was looking for a recipe that was simple, pretty healthy and no baking soda needed.  texture was nice.  not gooey like brownies at all; dense but not too heavy...it was still moist.  i did cut back on the sugar molasses but next time i wont...i will follow recipe exactly as i feel it could have used it.  thanks for sharing..."
2774239,36217,2013-10-05,3,Very dense and heavy.
4470,102171,2006-05-13,5,  The maple  syrup with the cinnamon gives a special flavor to this squash. Try to use real maple syrup - there is a definate difference to the taste  I did not use any brown sugar just the syrup.  The squash was quite meaty so I covered them with foil for the first 30 minutes  then unvovered for a further 30 minutes. Thanks Chef Dee for adding enjoyment to my dinner
186802,102171,2008-08-03,5,This was absolutely yummy!  I made this for part of my Saturday night dinner!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing is is that it took an hour or so.  Thank you so much for this incredible squash recipe! :)
1643242,102171,2010-06-29,5,My wife are not squash eaters. We tried this recipe on a whim. This will be the third time that I have fixed it. Since I do alot of the cooking it is an easy recipe to follow.
4470,12619,2002-02-10,5,"Excellent recipe.  I cooked it for 3 minutes and used a teaspoon of oil, lots of pepper and the balsamic vinegar gives it just the right zip.  No wonder it's your favorite."
30231,12619,2002-04-10,2,"Basically a good idea and easy,However, the asparagus needed a much longer cooking time. Also, one T oil was not enough; maybe it would have been in a non-stick pan but that's not what I used."
51089,12619,2003-03-13,5,"Yummy! Like vivian7, I used more oil and cooked the asparagus a little longer. I also used just a pinch of sugar. Great for company!"
21752,12619,2003-03-22,5,"There was this gorgeous bunch of asparagus calling out to me in the supermarket.  They were a little expensive, but spring is just around the corner, and I felt like treating myself.  Now I needed the perfect recipe, and Eve has never let me down!  She didn't this time as well, and I really enjoyed every delicious green bite!  I cut the asparagus into 1 inch pieces, used about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, added some fresh garlic and a bit more balsamic vinegar than was called for.  I stir-fried the asparagus for about 3 minutes.  My one mistake was preparing these ahead of time.  By the time dinner rolled around, there was hardly any left, I had been picking at them all afternoon.  Thanks Evie, these deserve much more than a measly 5 stars!"
119445,12619,2004-01-06,5,What's not to like?  All those great flavors and so easy. When served my dh covered his in parmezan cheese. Too good. I had to make this two days in a row in order for us to get our fill!
27416,12619,2004-05-07,5,"Hi Evie;
Cut my own home-grown asparagus, first cutting, fresh, fresh and fresh from the garden.
Turned out excellent,loved the balsamic vinegar, added to the flavor.  I did add a sprinkle of hot red pepper flakes along with the freshly ground black pepper.
Slowly fried for 4 minutes, then added vinegar, stirred, removed from heat, covered and let the flavors do their job.
Thanks, this will be a regular.
""Uncle Bill"""
5060,12619,2004-05-23,5,"Our favourite veggie this time of the year.  Nice simple recipe and quick, we like our asparagus to be a little crunchy and this worked perfectly. Love the taste of the balsamic with the asparagus, we will be makeing this one again, thanks for posting."
149075,12619,2004-12-31,5,"I will never steam asparagus again, thank you!"
49304,12619,2005-02-09,5,"Great recipe, We love Asparagus, this is another yummy recipe. I made it using 2 teaspoons of Olive oil & the rest as stated in the recipe. We loved the flavor of the balsamic vinegar. Thank you Evie, for posting the recipe."
167225,12619,2005-03-21,5,All of the flavors in this combine really well. I will definitely make it many times.
64934,12619,2005-03-25,5,"I've always roasted my asparagus in the oven, so I was very curious to try his recipe.  I'm sure glad I did!  It was so easy and quick to prepare, and the balsamic vinegar added a nice flavour to the asparagus!  I certainly will be making this again.  Thanks Evie!"
6258,12619,2005-03-26,5,"This is a delightful recipe.  The asparagus was flavorful and zingy!
I made this exactly as you directed, and was so happy with the results.  Definately a new tried and true recipe. :-)"
182809,12619,2005-03-26,5,"This is as good as it gets! Followed your recipe as written, but before putting the asparagus in pan, I toasted a hand-full of pine nuts. This was extra nice cause I din not have to turn the oven on. Thanks for this keeper!"
103628,12619,2005-03-27,5,"We eat asparagus quite often, and always prepare it the same way.  This was such a nice change--so yummy!  One tip--don't do what I did--which was not dry the asparagus thoroughly before putting it into the hot oil.  Yikes!  Lotsa popping oil is not a good thing.  ;)  But the taste of this recipe IS a good thing!  "
122235,12619,2005-03-27,4,"Very nice asparagus dish!  I usually do a garlic/olive oil asparagus, but when I looked at the menu, there sure was a whole lotta garlic being served.  I tried this recipe & found it to be a very nice change from the usual.  I did add a bit of sea salt, otherwise followed Evie's recipe faithfully."
207176,12619,2005-04-20,4,Thanks for this easy recipe.  I added sliced mushrooms since I had them and I added salt.  Best of all for me is that my husband liked it!
102058,12619,2005-06-16,5,"10 stars Evie!, you have converted me from boiling or steaming my asparagus forever! I read all the reviews and
cooked mine a little bit longer, in a little more oil (older frypan & personal preference) and served these on a bed of julieanned carrots with a sprinkle of Parmisan cheese...The flavour was brilliant and if I was told I could take only one veggie dish with me to a dessert island for a year, this would be it ! The balsamic compliments the flavour of the asparagus and the zing is refreshing. Foster son said he liked it very much indeed (usually everything is ""good"" and he shovels it in)...and I had to laughingly fight him for the last spears in the dish since we reached for them simultainously :)He won, but I have this recipe on the menu for guests in the weekend so my next fix of these is close by :) In aditition to the great taste this recipe is super easy and super quick... please see my rating system: a brilliantly deserved 5 stars:) Thanks !"
40533,12619,2005-07-10,4,Very good recipe. Nice and basic and allowed the flavor of the asparagus to really come through instead of overpowering it with something else stronger. Thank you very much.
144798,12619,2005-11-16,5,I made this for my Mom and GF and they just loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.
235067,12619,2005-12-11,5,Simple and easy and they taste great!  I used a garlic balsamic to my recipe.  Will use again and again.  Thank you.
60989,12619,2005-12-27,5,A very tasty and simple dish. The balsamic doesn't overpower the asparagus but compliments it. Thank you!
231054,12619,2006-01-07,5,What a terrific way to prepare asparagus.  Everyone loved it -- but the great thing was that they couldn't figure out that secret ingredient (the balsamic).  I cooked it EXACTLY as your instructions were written.  It was perfect.  I think the asparagus would be a little on the limp side if cooked any longer.  Thanks for a great recipe.
282735,12619,2006-01-10,5,"Excellent...we loved it!  I used garlic olive oil, but then again I use garlic in everything! ;)"
215083,12619,2006-01-12,5,Very good!  Thank you.
277472,12619,2006-01-24,5,"Great recipe!  Asparagus was nice and crispy, and tasted like it was a lot more work than it was."
133174,12619,2006-03-23,5,Can't believe I haven't made this before?  It is very good and very quick.  The balsamic vinegar adds the perfect touch.
302961,12619,2006-03-26,4,"Loved the flavor, I did add a little fresh garlic to my  EVOO before adding the Asparagus, my father thought it was tough, I thought it tasted great.  I do think I need to increase cooking time if I fix again. "
95743,12619,2006-04-27,5,Excellent technique.  Don't know why this couldn't be used on other quick-cooking fresh vegetables.
73471,12619,2006-04-28,4,"For years and years my family never could wrap their heads around balsamic vinegar in anything else but a cold dish or salad. Now they have seen the light. I thank you for opening the door on a new way to enjoy food. I will aslo say that I used a 9 dollar bottle of balsamic that was more for salad dressings than fanciful cooking, but this was the first time tried. I'll get back to you when I break out the good stuff.

I served this dish as a side with a grilled unmarinated sirloin and a baked potato in which it matched well as to be expected. Wine served was an Australlian syrah that did well to match both the steak and the vegetable. However, I would go with a Napa Valley Pinot Noir if you plan to marinate the steak or use garlic in the asparagus. 

I also found that the asparagus helps with a few minutes of rest after the stir fry before the vinegar is added. Kill the heat, cover, let sit, then add vinegar, stir, cover and let sit again. That should cure any problems with undercooking the asparagus."
165416,12619,2006-05-25,5,"Quick, easy, tasty, a perfect recipe!"
215829,12619,2006-10-14,5,I have always done the roasted asparagus thing but was looking for something different.  Found this and fell in love.  Really good.  Thanks so much for sharing.
291650,12619,2006-12-02,5,"Thanks Evie - a great, simple recipe. Asparagus is everywhere at the moment and this is a wonderful (and different) way of serving!"
88099,12619,2006-12-09,5,"So simple yet so delicious.  Loved the taste the balsamic gave these.  I did cook mine longer than stated, but not a big deal.  Thanks Evie"
387559,12619,2007-01-14,5,I am a asparagus eater. I will try any recipe for it. This one was one of the best. I loved the flavor.
317712,12619,2007-01-21,5,"Very good and easy.  I overcooked the asparagus a bit, stick with the 3-5 minutes. Served with Balkava Salmon."
240552,12619,2007-02-03,5,"This was my first time cooking fresh asparagus.  It was wonderful!  My son loved it, too!"
254805,12619,2007-02-04,5,Great way to serve asparagus. very easy and elegant. Thanks!
192623,12619,2007-03-14,5,"Quick and easy and delicious!  Recommend only making enough for your meal, as it doesn't seem to heat up well the next day - but that's not the recipe's fault - that's just asparagus!  A really great way to add a little flavor to asparagus without adding tons of calories and fat.  This is the only way I will make asparagus from now on!"
174096,12619,2007-03-28,5,"Delicious!  I am not a fan of asparagus, so I came looking for a recipe that would make it more appealing.  This was perfect.  The tang of the balsamic vinegar was exactly right.  Thanks!"
8688,12619,2007-04-03,5,"Truly great! So easy and very tender and flavorful!  I will absolutely make this again.  Thanks so much for sharing, Evie!"
26719,12619,2007-04-04,5,"This recipe is amazing.  I served it to MIL, DH's Aunt and Cousin when they were over for dinner.  Everyone raved about it. 

I followed the directions to a T and I would absolutely not change a thing! 

I served it with Basmati rice, Luby's Chicken Lombardy, and ~Christine~'s Broccoli Salad.  

I have also made it by roasting the asparagus in a stone baking dish and drizzling with balsamic at the end.  Same great taste.   This is a keeper."
468146,12619,2007-05-07,4,Evie this recipe was really good! I served them with marinated flank steak and grilled gorn on the cob. I did add some roasted garlic and garlic and herb seasoning to them. I liked the tang the balsamic vinegar gave the asparagus. This one is a nice change from steamed asparagus and I will make again!
358796,12619,2007-05-13,5,"Simple veggie dishes are my favorite, and this is no exception. Olive oil, balsamic and pepper season the asparagus just right while still allowing the great, natural veggie flavor to shine through. And easy and quick way to prepare those spring spears! You could also do this on the grill the same way. Yum."
27643,12619,2007-05-14,5,"Wish I could give more stars! This is wonderful! The Balsamic vinegar is perfect with the asparagus. We had this with steak and boiled new red potatoes. Thanks Evie, for a recipe I will use often!"
199418,12619,2007-06-05,5,"This was great.  I usually make a similar recipe that requires oven roasting.  This is so much better on a hot day because it doesn't heat the house up, not to mention it is quicker."
60124,12619,2007-09-06,5,"easy, good, served with fish"
582788,12619,2007-09-23,5,"*****BRILLIANT*****
You just made an asparagus lover out of me! This is THE way asparagus should be eaten, hands-down! The balsamic vinegar accentuates this vegetable perfectly. Thanks so much Ma Duck!

P.S. I had to make a second batch of this asparagus because I ""accidentally"" ate the first one before it got to the table...oops."
184530,12619,2007-10-21,5,"Quick, simple & tasty!  I cooked the asparagus for the full five minutes and it was perfect: crisp, but not undercooked.  Loved the spiciness of the freshly cracked black pepper combined with the balsamic.  Be sure to use good vinegar."
376098,12619,2007-10-23,5,"Fantastic!  Took no time at all and was cooked to a perfect crispness.  A keeper, for sure!"
258877,12619,2007-10-26,3,"If you are not using the oven, this is a quick and easy way to cook asparagus.  I am not sure what I am looking for, but plenty of recipes to try here... This was not one of my favourites."
485728,12619,2008-02-26,5,"The asparagus was divine!  I cooked it about twice as long to get it a little softer, and I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.  Thanks so much."
158086,12619,2008-03-18,5,"I just loved this, and it was so easy as you do not have to cook it first before frying....will make often..."
242205,12619,2008-03-24,5,"This is delightful! Served it for Easter with grilled lamb chops, carmelized carrots and roasted potatoes. Yum! Thanks for sharing."
425677,12619,2008-03-25,5,I have made this twice in two weeks already!  This is now my new favorite recipe!  I did alter it just a bit to our taste.  I used 2 tbs olive oil.  Salted them just as much as I peppered them and fried them for about 5 minutes and then let them simmer covered for about 5 more minutes.  I like them a little more tender instead of super crisp.  This is just my personal preference though.  Great recipe!!!!
634448,12619,2008-03-25,2,"I don't know what happened, but this recipe didn't work for ,e.  it took a LONG time to cook through, in fact, I ended up taking it out and steaming it in the microwave, and then I sautee'd it some more and added the balsamic.  I didn't really like the taste (and I love asparagus, and like balsamic).  Sorry, just not my fav flaor combo, and especailly when it took so long."
507071,12619,2008-03-29,5,Loved IT!
228187,12619,2008-04-17,5,keeper
166475,12619,2008-04-19,4,"A friend rated this, as they love asparagus and I merely tolerate it. He said the flavor wasn't quite ""wow"" enough for him to rate a five star, but he did enjoy it better than steamed asparagus. I ate a whole stalk, which usually doesn't happen, so it must be a good recipe!"
318361,12619,2008-05-03,5,Just what I was looking for!  I remembered that I like a butter and balsamic combo so I used butter.  It came out sensational.  Thanks Evie for the inspiration.
198082,12619,2008-05-04,4,"this is a really delicious and simple way to prepare Asparagus. I ran out of pepper so i used Montreal Steak Seasoning. I only used a few dashes, however that combined with the Balsamic Vinegar was delicious. My 4 year old, who rarely eats Vegetables and has NEVER liked asparagus ate this and enjoyed it. Even my picky DH liked it. It was really good. The Asparagus turns out crispy and firm, not soggy like it is sometimes when you steam or boil it. This is a keeper."
731905,12619,2008-05-17,4,A little sharp but maybe I used to much balsamic.  This was so easy though!  I added a sprinkle of cheese as well.  Will make again!
194829,12619,2008-05-27,5,"I loved this recipe. The pepper is such a simple ingredient, but it really brought out the flavor of the fresh asparagus. I'll always make it this way. Thanks!"
144897,12619,2008-05-27,4,Delicious!  I will definitely be making asparagus like this more often.  I did leave out the pepper because I don't care for it but I love balsamic vinegar so that more than made up for it in flavor for me.  Thanks so much for sharing! :)
172172,12619,2008-08-03,5,"EMMMM EMMMM! Love that balsamic/pepper combo! The first time I made the recipe as is, and the second time I added some red pepper flakes and grated garlic. ;) Delish. Especially great in the summer when you really don't want to turn the oven on. Thanks Evie!"
20480,12619,2008-08-11,5,"What a lovely way to prepare asparagus.I had not seen your recipe but followed it to a T. Before posting my gem;I decided to search Balsamic Asparagus and there you are.
Thanks for posting it for me.really good!
Rita"
886144,12619,2008-08-12,3,"found this kindda bland, added some salt. nothing great sorry."
330505,12619,2008-09-14,4,Very nice change for asparagus. Incredibly easy to prepare! Thanks for posting!  Made for the I Recommend Tag Game.
146742,12619,2008-11-09,5,"5 stars for simplicity.  I liked the fact there's no need to turn the oven on.  Even though I only used 1 TBS. balsamic vinegar, It was a little too strong a flavor  for us, but I think it was because my asparagus were very thin stalks and not thick.
I will make this again."
1027710,12619,2008-11-17,0,"very good, very fast!!!  My hubby loved it>  Thanks for the post."
1048945,12619,2008-12-09,5,"I made these to go with my roast and mashed potatoes and they are delicious!  We all loved the flavor of the vinegar with the veggies and this is a new way to serve them, which I am always looking for!"
440735,12619,2009-02-06,0,Easy but ok!
486648,12619,2009-03-16,5,"Fan-freakin-tastic!! We served this with pork and garlic mashed potatoes, and it really completed our meal. I added some parmesan cheese after cooking, and it complemented the flavor. Thanks for this great recipe!"
140132,12619,2009-05-08,4,This was good.  The kids love asparagus too and DH and I were having to defend our asparagus on our plates from the kids after they ate all theirs.....lol.  Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe.
325654,12619,2009-05-21,5,Great recipe! Now one of my favourite ways to eat asparagus!
1077944,12619,2009-05-26,5,"Great flavor, really easy to make.  Watch closely though - it's easy to overcook and especially with asparagus, I prefer undercooked to overcooked. Thanks Evie!"
746800,12619,2009-07-07,1,"Yuck.  The flavor in this was not complimentary.  The balsamic totally overpowers the asparagus flavor, a feat that's hard to do in my opinion."
352538,12619,2009-07-12,5,Yummy.  It took a few minutes longer than 5 (maybe 7) but it was well worth it.  Fast and delicious.  Everyone enjoyed it.
964469,12619,2009-11-16,5,Mmmmm. I just cooked it and it was really good.
1523279,12619,2010-02-05,0,Thanks for a nifty variation on this fav veg of ours...........will never just boil tem again!
1374955,12619,2010-02-25,5,"We LOVE this recipe.
I made it last night and will again this weekend.
This goes in our fav. recipe file."
800077,12619,2010-03-23,4,"This is a really lovely way to eat fresh asparagus.  I usually just roast it because I'm unsure of what to do with it in the pan.  I've made it once true to recipe, and once I added a touch of dijon mustard and honey to the vinegar.  I must admit I like it even more with the additions, but this is a great idea to build from."
1588791,12619,2010-04-20,4,"I have been making this similar family recipe for years now, and I still get compliments from friends when I serve it!!"
261797,12619,2010-04-20,5,"I've been doing something similar for a couple of years now.  I toss the asparagus with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, black pepper and sea salt, then put it on the grill til it starts to caramelize a little, then drop it back into the dressing for another quick toss before plating.  When I'm feeling fancy, I shave some parmigiana reggiano curls on top, on the plate."
1601627,12619,2010-04-21,5,"Yum- I love this and make it a lot!

I also like to chill it afterwards and then put the balsamic and oil on top, and sprinkle with a little feta cheese and serve cold. Delicious!"
1541495,12619,2010-04-25,0,Delicious flavor and so simple!  Before serving I sliced up a fresh tomatoe and added.  Next time I will invest in GOOD balsamic.  I will make again.
249880,12619,2010-05-04,5,This was sooooo good! Thank you for a new way to do asparagus!
191533,12619,2010-05-06,5,"I still think the asparagus is most delicious if you roast it to smithereens, but we like this recipe too. It probably retains more nutrients this way..."
1269015,12619,2010-09-24,4,"This is nice and sweet, and very easy to make. Can't go wrong there! Thanks for sharing."
415907,12619,2011-01-06,5,This was very good! I rubbed salt and pepper on the asparagus before I put them in the pan.
969655,12619,2011-04-10,5,I am so glad that I tried this. I really really liked the flavor the balsamic gave the asparagus. I did add a tiny bit of kosher salt once they were on the plate. Absolutely delicious. I served this with recipe 416056 for Garlic Parm. pork chops and a green salad. So tasty. Thanks for the great idea. Not sure I will cook asparagus any other way.
28087,12619,2012-05-05,5,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Made as written and was very pleased with the outcome, wonderful flavor and great texture, just the way I like asparagus cooked. I served this with Recipe #86649 Thanks for posting! Made for ""Down on the Farm"" Photo Tag May 2012!"
1669908,12619,2013-06-28,5,Quick and easy!
198154,12619,2018-03-02,4,"Was in need of a quick, yet tasty, way to cook some asparagus. This recipe was both of those. Served as a side to salmon."
47892,184980,2008-08-24,5,I love this salad and have the same recipe in one of my cookbooks except it doesn't mention the optional bleu cheese (it's either or for this recipe-parm or bleu but not both.) I toast the walnuts first. To tone down the strong peppery flavor of arugula I sub some baby spinach leaves or loose leaf lettuce. Thanks cg
4470,184980,2010-04-17,5,"What a taste treat this is! Everything just blends together to create a great taste sensation.
I had Italian Parmesan and it wouldn't curl when I shaved it but the flavor Mmmm. I cut the salad back to one serving and used 1 tsp of Walnut oil.  A definite will do again salad."
107135,464792,2011-10-27,5,this is going in my man trap cook book.  its really easy tastes good. made it with recipe #440442 and worked well  .people that dont care for carrots would eat this . i just cooked up a bag of those little snack carrots easy
560491,464792,2011-12-29,5,Great carrots.  The sweetness from the brown sugar and the salty bacon are wonderful together.  Made as written and would not change a thing.  Going into my Best of cookbook.  Made for Everyday Holiday.
209983,134289,2005-10-31,5,"This was very refreshing and tasty.  We all really loved it.  My son and I love banana's and this incredible!  I liked the idea of the coconut, we didnt rim the glass with it but had it in the drink and the coconut gave it a nice touch.  Thanks for posting
"
222055,134289,2005-12-21,5,"I think I feel the boost! This is something I definetly need- a fitness booster! I love the taste and the ease of making this drink. I drank the first glass immediately after taking pictures and I have the rest in the fridge getting cold. I am going to have it in the morning for breakfast! I'm glad I finally got the nerve up to make one of ""the kings"" recipes. 
(That's my nickname for Thorsten. To me he is the king of photography on zaar!)
Thanks Thorsten, I can't wait to actually have it after a future workout!!!"
47510,134289,2005-12-29,5,"I chose this recipe for the Holiday Cheer photo swap and served it at our Christmas brunch.  I doubled the recipe, using 4 tablespoons of honey since we like sweeter beverages.  I did use Thorsten's suggestion of rimming the glasses with honey and coconut and it made a lovely presentation.  The recipe was super easy to prepare and my whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  "
121789,134289,2006-04-19,4,Good.  This is a good short term energy boost.  I did try to call it breakfast one day but could actually feel it wear off partway through the morning.  It's perfect as a boost when you finish a workout but need extra energy to make lunch or drive home or something.
230258,134289,2006-05-08,5,"This tasted great!It had so many different flavors so it was a treat with every slurp! I did really well in my track meet today and it may have something to do with this drink! So thanks, for both the recipe and my track talents!"
281399,134289,2006-05-13,5,Very Deelish!! Not to sweet.The bananas I used were frozen. Instant cold! We will be making this again. Thanks so much for posting!
288618,134289,2006-08-02,5,"I love this drink!! I make it all the time. I use lite coconut milk. I also make 1 serv. So I use 1 frozen banana, juice from half lemon, 1/4 cup oj, 1/3 cup coconut milk, 2/3 cup milk and 1 tbs honey. SOOOOO Good!!!! Thanks Thorsten!"
427184,134289,2007-05-17,5,"5 stars! The consistency was great, and I loved the coconut milk in it giving it that little extra. It also wasn't terribly sweet which I also liked, I used a flower honey which is a little more mild and I really enjoyed it. I also added 2 tbsp of ground flax. Thanks!"
738867,134289,2008-01-24,5,I had this after working out the other night.  It was like a tropical party in my mouth.
1374435,182780,2009-09-04,1,if you really really like bananas then you will enjoy this. i made it and all i tasted was banana... exactly the same as an uncooked banana.
39835,112648,2005-03-27,5,This was wonderful with dinner and leftovers will be great for breakfast and lunches. Although we skipped the nuts and dressing this was enjoyed by all. Thanks for sharing this keeper which we will be having often.
593927,112648,2012-03-06,5,"I enjoyed this more than I thought I would but it is not properly food combined with the bananas and for that reason and that I don't like bananas much anyway I would leave them out if I were to make this again. I used recipe#38413 in a greater quantity for the dressing and poured it over top rather than mixing it in, just before serving. I may leave the walnuts out as well if I make this another time. Made for Please Review My Recipe ~ ~ ~ from February 14th"
870705,112648,2012-05-21,5,"I used 1 banana, 1 apple and 1 can of Mandarin oranges and omitted the nuts.  I used the canned oranges because we like those better than regular oranges.  You didn't say what kind of salad dressing to use or if you meant the kind that looks like mayonnaise so I just used mayo.  It was great!  Just like a salad we have at Christmas except ours never had oranges.  Made for Please Review My Recipe cooking tag game."
59064,18901,2004-05-24,5,Very easy recipe that makes a good icecream substitute and has no dairy in it.Big hit with our 3 year old.
225882,18901,2005-06-28,5,Was a great addition to our luau.  And a great deal better than the real stuff (yuk)  Thanks!
303545,18901,2007-02-17,5,"I love banana poi.  So happy that this is posted on here!  I'm not keen on poi, so this is a great alternative :)"
1677099,18901,2011-10-27,5,"This is great!  It is so simple and tasty.  I used a little less coconut cream than the recipe.  I just ate it with chicken and rice and it was lovely.  I can imagine doing many different things to vary it.....limes, coconut milk, adding spices, for example red pepper flakes or cinnamon, depending on what I want to serve it with.  Maybe I need to have a luau now."
30534,33545,2004-10-15,5,Excellent! A delicious and easy way to dress up beets. I toasted the walnuts in a skillet on the stove top but wound up using only 1/2 the nuts and doubling the blue cheese. Another great recipe by Miller®™
27678,33545,2005-09-09,5,"Wonderful salad! I had some sad old beets hanging around the fridge (they last forever) and had nearly given up hope of finding a recipe that would make them ""fresh"" again but this one has a lot of zip and it's so easy too. I also upped the amount of blue cheese. Make sure to add it at the last moment or your blue cheese turns pink! Made a great side to fish."
13593,33545,2006-04-22,5,"Simple ingredients and simple preparation make this recipe a hit for me.  Not only is this delicious and affordable, it has many good health benefits from the nuts, beets, and cheese.  Everything in moderation of course.  I added the toasted walnuts while they were hot and it made the cheese drizzly and yummy.  Adding the hot walnuts does dull the color of the beets, but still tastes wonderful.  Thanks Miller, and I am sure you have the angles laughing so hard their sides hurt.   "
340141,33545,2006-11-24,3,This was very good.
464080,33545,2008-05-04,4,"I would rate a 5 and hubby a 3, so we met in the middle at a 4.  Super quick salad.  Didn't have any walnuts on hand, so used slivered almonds which tasted great!"
494084,33545,2008-09-21,5,"Unfortunately, I did not have any walnuts for this recipe so I can't really rate it as written.  Having said that, what could go wrong when you combine beets and blue cheese.  Two of my favorite ingredients combine to make *WOW*.  I might never have put these 2 things toghether if it were not for this recipe.  I am so glad I did!!!  Try this one......Thanks for the great recipe!"
849727,33545,2010-03-21,3,"Fresh and light, but a little boring."
341513,33545,2010-05-19,4,"I made this without the walnuts and cooked it in foil in the oven for 20 minutes at 350. The balance was good, and I think I only give it 4 stars because I still don't like beets :) Just not quite stellar to me."
125266,166149,2007-08-05,5,I had to substitute dried figs and the salad was still a hit.
176615,166149,2008-06-22,5,Loved this! Fresh figs and blue cheese were meant to go together! Only change I made was to use all baby arugula. Fresh lemon with a dash of olive oil was just the right amount of dressing. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
389243,135634,2007-06-14,5,"What a handy idea.  I started doing this shortly after seeing your tip.  I cook up an entire package and freeze the remainder.  I find it easy to put together a BLT, use for bacon and eggs or as a garnish for bits.  It only takes a minute to warm in the microwave. 

Thanks for the handy tip!"
310480,135634,2007-09-25,5,I already cooked my own bacon to use instead of buying them.  I love the tip to freeze them.  I will definitely be trying that.  I just cooked mine enough for a few days in the refrigerator.  Thanks for the time-saving tip.
143318,482224,2012-09-20,5,Perfectly cooked parsnips!
465056,457823,2011-07-20,5,I made this to go with French Toast.  I was so busy making the French Toast that by the time I was ready to sample this it was GONE!  Not even a nibble left.  It sure looked pretty though.  I would just have to say it must have been at least a 5 star because the potato hating kids even scarfed it down.
520644,457823,2011-10-05,5,"Wonderful flavor!  Mine crumbled instead of staying in a 'cake', but that could be because I cut the recipe down.  Either way this is a great recipe! Made for 123 tag game"
193060,198763,2007-06-14,3,"I'm not sure if the taste warranted the work.  It wasn't difficult by any means but it didn't ""wow"" me.  On the other hand I had a friend that was bowled over by them so it may just be personal taste.  They seem a bit ""retro"" to me."
6357,41005,2002-11-22,5,"I halved this recipe and made this as a part of our dinner tonight. I used a block of 250gm tofu(paneer), a little over 1/2 tsp. of curry powder, a little over 1/2 tsp. of fresh lemon juice(instead of lime) and a little over 1 1/2 tbsps. of fresh orange juice. I pre-heated my oven at 220C and then baked this for exactly 25 minutes at 220C. Served these hot, right out of the oven! This is the ""BEST"" appetiser I've ever eaten! Everyone in my family loved it and nobody could believe that there was not even a pinch of salt in these! Truly good to have at a party. I love your idea of using the leftovers as a sandwich filling with chutney - splendid! Since these are dry, I definitely wouldn't categorise them under ""curries"". Also, I'd put them as a side dish and not the main course. These are best enjoyed on their own rather than with rice, since these come out dry once baked. Thank You so much for sharing a GREAT and EASY recipe."
19973,41005,2003-01-15,4,"I gave this a high rating because it's  Tofu and I liked it!   I did it just as you said.  I think the concentrated OJ with the curry powder was the trick.
My husband & I are counting calories and Tofu was on sale.

Thanks,
Debbie 97380

"
102937,41005,2003-09-09,1,"We eat tofu all the time and I love to try interesting recipes.  I didn't know what I was expecting, but I really did not like the taste.  I think the orange concentrate overwhelmed the curry.  I ended up throwing it all in the trash!  Sorry!"
4470,41005,2003-10-25,5,"This has a delightful flavor - I made it for a vegetarian friend to have as her meat course (we were having Japanese stew) and she enjoyed it very much.  Be careful that the sauce does not burn on the bottom of the dish.  I marinated the tofu all day in the fridge in the sauce. I flipped the tofu over , as suggested, half way through the baking it was a rich golden color.  I agree that this recipe would make excellent appetizers  I would serve them a drop of hot chili sauce and cut into cubes instead of the larger triangles Thanks rsarahl for a new tofu recipe"
111336,41005,2005-08-24,3,"Good, quick, easy recipe.  The leftovers are nice cold for sandwiches.  These were a litte mild for our taste, we'll add more curry next time.  The sauce burned in the bottom of the pan, a real mess; line with foil and spray with PAM."
340130,41005,2007-07-10,5,"This was really good. I used a red curry powder and bottled lime juice. I coated it with the marinade on both sides and baked for 30 mins turning after 15. It was really good with brown rice ...
next time I may try with a chutney on the side. I WILL be making this one again and again. Thanks!"
920589,41005,2008-08-29,1,"Had to bake for nearly an hour, turning every so often to get the tofu to brown-- and even then it was soggy & floppy, not crisp. Tasted like raw tofu with OJ and a bit of pepper (from the curry powder). Wouldn't re-do."
61569,194409,2009-07-02,5,Wonderful taste and very simple to make.  Had my steamer out for other dishes and used that to steam the already peeled and diced potatoes and that worked out great.  Made the recipe for 2 servings only and that worked out perfectly.  Made for Unrated Asian Recipe Tag Game.
632249,317351,2011-01-30,5,"I made this mix to include in my Xmas Goody Baskets this year and it has gotten great<br/>reviews from the recipients. It is a cinch to make and is economical. As you can see by the <br/>photos, I used baggies rather than a jar and it looked cute! Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
2159715,472781,2012-01-24,5,Works like a charm and SIMPLE to Au Gratin anything.  So nice to better understand the mother sauces and be able to make quick variations.
55670,472781,2013-02-13,5,Absolutely fabulous!  I make bechamel quite often and its great to see the variations other than my own.
2899711,472781,2015-07-11,5,Fantastic! I know the basic bechamel and now to know how to do all the variations is wonderful! Thank you so much.
272731,242934,2007-08-14,5,"I have to laugh about this dish. When I first tasted it I thought it was very bland, but by the time I finished eating it-far too much later-I had decided it was totally outstanding, ultimate comfort food! :) I had enough ground beef to almost double it, but not quite, so my doubling it left it a little liquidy-my fault for putting too much milk in. I used 1/2 Mama Iulucci's pasta sauce that I had made last weekend. I baked it in a 13 x 9 pan, and I divided my biscuits by layers in half and put them on top of the casserole at half height, because we have trouble getting biscuits to get done on the bottom when we put them on casseroles. They got done and also cut the carbs somewhat since I only used half the biscuits I otherwise would. Then I sprinkled a little cheddar on top the last 10 minutes or so of baking. I will definately make this again and hopefully do a better job of doubling it-my family is big. Thanks for the recipe!"
174090,242934,2008-09-22,4,"My casserole-hating family gobbled this up. I used spaghetti sauce and it had a good comfort-food flavor. The biscuits were still raw on the bottom after 40 minutes so it took a bit longer to get them to finish baking, but that didn't hurt the flavor of the casserole at all."
6220,1823,2001-06-14,5,Darn Good!!
16140,1823,2001-09-04,4,Very *Moreish*Added a little dry mustard to the dough mix.
129201,1823,2005-03-12,5,"Yummy bikkies that are easy to make...they DO go really well with a beer...lol.  I might try Julie's idea of the dry mustard or maybe some chopped chives next time, just for a bit of variation.  Thanks Doreen - I've tried a number of your recipes now and they are always winners!!!"
508459,1823,2007-06-05,5,"Delicious!  Easy to make, perfect for a snack, my kids loved these.  Gonna make them next time we have a card game."
881977,191468,2011-11-04,3,"We tried this out this evening - out of 6 people, only 1 thought it was ok.  (Since it was me, I decided on 3 stars; the rest of the family would have given it an average of 1.) Definitely needed a longer cooking time for us as the thinner slices weren't cooked all the way through.  We're saving the slices and will try to use the rest of it in cake, sweet bread or pie so we can get some use out of them."
19683,17304,2003-03-21,5,Great departure from the norm and very very good.  Thank you.
462637,271022,2007-12-15,4,"Loved it! I doubled the recipe but reduced the amount of cayenne pepperand hot sauce, as pregnancy is not allowing me to tolerate spicy food much. Made some AWESOME BBQ Turkey Meatballs. Thanks for the recipe."
305531,271022,2014-04-26,5,Great BBQ sauce. I made it as directed but used 1/2 of the cayenne and chili powder which was perfect for us. A bit of a bite but not overwhelming. This made great BBQ chicken. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for Spring PAC 2014.
128473,271022,2015-02-05,5,"Thank you for sharing this hot n spicy BBQ Sauce.  It is the bomb.  So hot, spicy and flavorful.  I loved that you could taste the mustard, and spices. It was quick and easy to make.  It was wonderful basted on roasted pork tenderloin.  The perfect foil.  I&#039;m looking forward to the sandwiches today.  The meat will be even more flavorful, I&#039;m sure.  Made for the Best of 2014 Tag Game."
936601,198343,2008-10-13,4,"Very nice.  DH loves anything banana and this was rated by him as ""a keeper""   I did cut down a bit on the cinnamon and allspice, delicious all the smae!  Thank you for the post!  Made for Fall PAC 2008."
21841,3149,2003-02-13,5,This is fantastic.  I made it the first time according to the recipe and I made it a second time and cut slits in  a T-bone steak and inserted the garlic.  Each time was a winner.  It doesn't get any easier than this.  It's Garlic/balsamic lovers dream!!
110506,3149,2004-05-02,4,This was very good. I used a steak here in the Netherlands which is called kogel beefsteak. It is a very lean tough piece of meat and this marinade vastly improved the flavor and the tenderness. I cooked the steaks on the charcoal grill and they were very tasty. 
331305,3149,2006-07-04,5,"Quick, easy and so good! We have only used this recipe for our steaks since finding it on this website! "
338394,3149,2006-07-30,5,"I loved it!  You have to adjust the ingredients a bit though.  I recommend reducing the olive oil by half, doubling the balsamic vinegar and leaving it ""wet"" (don't pat dry) when you put it on the grill.  Also, don't discard the garlic as it adds a great aroma and taste to the meat while it cooks.  This marinade is good for one pound of steak only, you will need to make more for larger portions of meat.  Marinade for a minimum of one hour for each inch of thickness.  I know the receipe says that the balsamic vinegar doesn't have to be expensive but make sure it's strong or you will be left with a steak that has a great aroma with little flavor.  Again, I love it and highly recommend it to those individuals who like their steaks with a little flair.   "
362734,3149,2007-05-05,5,"Made the marinade as written but cut my steaks into cubes for kabobs. I let the cubes of steak marinade for about an hour. The skewered steak cooked quickly on the grill. We thought the flavor was very good, slightly tangy and spicy. Even my 2 year old liked it. Thanks for the keeper recipe!"
581574,3149,2007-09-23,1,I tried this recipe for my steak dinner and I am sorry we did not like this at all.....I followed what another reviewer said...and I apologize but we could not even eat this...we had to through it out...I could have done something wrong but maybe balsamic vinegar is not for us...as it was our first time trying anything specifically with Balsamic vinegar
1141459,3149,2010-03-22,4,"This was pretty good. I made it per original instructions, but I will follow the changes another reviewer made to increase the vinegar and decrease oil next time. It was a great quick marinade with staples most people have at all times."
2001502556,3149,2017-04-23,4,"Balsamic Vinegar's purpose is to aid in penetration into the meat; with what-ever spice (garlic, salt, pepper, Chicago Rub or spice abc/xyz of your choice. OK to be creative...as long as its a good cut of fresh meat cooked properly its hard to go wrong!"
28572,17180,2002-01-17,5,"This stuff is great in the morning with a hot cup of cocoa on my back porch. Got any more recipes like this one, Barb?"
9869,17180,2002-03-26,5,"Quick and easy, the peanut butter gives it a lovely flavour. My husband asked if he could pleeeease have a couple big slices to take to work..lol
Thanks for posting!"
28649,17180,2002-04-11,5,"This was so simple to make and tastes very good. Of course, anything with peanut butter has to be good."
2369,17180,2002-05-21,1,"It was very easy and quick to make, but we did not care for the taste.  We prefer the bread made with shortening."
32143,17180,2003-01-18,5,"This is very good! Quick and easy
and my little girl loves it.
Thanks for the recipe."
102480,17180,2003-10-06,4,"Very good, and pretty good for you. Also easy to make."
152402,17180,2005-04-01,4,"I chose this recipe because it was very late at night and I wanted something really easy that didn't even require sifting.  It was definately easy.  And it had a good flavor, but I would add salt next time as it seemed to be missing something but I'm not sure what."
1028247,17180,2009-08-23,3,"Excellent with coffee, The amounts shown only made 1 loaf, and I would maybe put in a little more soda."
19021,1923,2001-09-17,5,This was pretty easy to make and very delicious. I have been searching for a recipe like this one for some time. I used canned pie filling and I am planning on trying cherry next time.
30746,1923,2002-02-20,2,"this was far too sweet and needed more apples, less sugar"
626447,1923,2009-07-24,5,"If you like your crisp nice and sweet keep it like it is.  If you like it less sweet cut back on the sugar in the Topping.  Served up with Vanilla ice cream or Cool Whip, it can't be beat!"
1381915,1923,2009-09-12,1,"Something about this recipe just doesn't seem right.  There is way too much topping, especially for that size baking pan.  It is too sweet.  I wish I had read the reviews first.  I probably would have picked a different recipe."
169430,287791,2008-05-19,0,"I'm not going to star this review because I feel that I did this recipe a real dis-service by being to cheap to buy the ask for bags. I used a ceramic dish that I tightly covered with Press and Seal wrap and punched 6 holes in the top of. I let it go for the 6 mins in the micro while I made pancakes. The aroma was incredible and had the whole downstairs smelling of apple and cinnamon. The trouble came when I opened the micro to find that the tightly sealed wrap had been steamed open and the liquid that had been made had bubbled out of the dish entirely. Now while the apples and nuts were fine (I used pecans as I'm out of walnuts) the cherries had become very hard and almost inedible with the lack of moisture. I think this would be really wonderful made with the bag as the recipe says. Also, I should mention that I used 3/4 tsp of Splenda Brown (I made one serving) and that made it plenty sweet. Made for Photo Tag."
424680,287791,2008-05-23,5,"What an easy treat to make, & so tasty, too! I followed the directions right down the line & the result was WONDERFUL, especially when served over some frozen peach yogurt! Can you imagine how long it would have taken Grandma to make this, way back when! Thanks for sharing your great recipe! [Made & reviewed as a kidnapped recipe in the Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #16]"
930714,287791,2008-08-22,5,I never thought something so simple could taste so great.  My husband and I loved this.  I can't wait to make this again for the rest of my family!
322453,287791,2008-11-06,5,This was a great filling for crepes for dessert tonight. I can't wait to eat the leftovers for breakfast :)
542159,287791,2009-11-16,5,"Yummy! We love baked apples and this has all the flavor of a baked apple in a mere 6 minutes. Was planning to serve over frozen yogurt, but after a big dinner we just eat plain in a bowl and Loved it. This would also be good on pancakes or over ice cream. Thanks so much for the great post."
573325,348917,2009-02-01,5,"Oh my gosh! These are very tasty pancakes!!!! I had them for breakfast today with cheese and maple syrup and they were just perfect. Not sweet, because they dont have sugar, but that was just right for the maple syrup. What a lovely combination of sweet and savoury! I added a little bit of cinnamon (1ts) to the batter which was nice.
For me this made 6 thick pancake. Made for Newest Zaar Tag 2009. Thank you so much for sharing, Sharon123!"
88099,348917,2009-02-11,5,Made these for dinner and we really enjoyed them with some warmed maple syrup.  I agree that these have the perfect sweetness to them.  I did add just a little vanilla but other than that made as directed.  Thanks so much for sharing.
628076,348917,2009-03-01,3,"Sorry to give these such a low review however, we just didn't care for these pancakes. When you bite into them and get a squish of cottage cheese it throws you off a bit. They are better after a few bites but I wouldn't take these over just a standard buttermilk pancake."
594923,348917,2009-03-09,5,I really liked these. The cottage cheese chunks really add something. I ate these with grated cheese on top. Yum!
1250824,348917,2009-06-07,5,These are delicious!  Golden brown and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  My mother used to make these every Christmas morning when I was growing up.  Was very happy to find a recipe for them on here.  Just like she used to make.  We serve them with a dollop of sour cream on top and a bit of Smuckers fruit syrup (boysenberry is my favorite).
248946,348917,2011-05-23,5,"A keeper!  I've been looking for a recipe that enough protein to give them staying power and this one is delicious and so filling, with a taste sort of like French toast.  I used my immersion blender on the cottage cheese mixture to make them lumpless for my kids and used it again with the whisk to whip the egg whites.  One kids had them with strawberry jam, another with cinnamon and sugar, and two with nothing but butter.  I can't wait to try jam and sour cream!  Thanks, Sharon123!"
22973,153891,2006-05-23,5,"These were probably the best Cauliflower I have ever made and eaten...My goodness but they were absolutely delicious!!! I also fried some mushrooms and onion rings in this same stuff,and all was delicious.We had them with ranch dressing for a dip.This stuff is great!!! Thanks, Darlene"
305531,153891,2006-08-01,5,"These were really good, especially with ranch dip.  We also tried these with leftover peanut sauce and that was surprisingly good as well. As already suggested, I will also do these with onions and mushrooms next time too. Thanks for the recipe!"
298043,153891,2006-08-02,5,These are addictively delicious.  My father's supper club served these years ago with a side of blue cheese dressing on the side.  They were the most popular appetizer. Thanks for posting!
89831,153891,2006-10-16,5,"This is a wonderful recipe, I did make a change to the spices though, I used <a href=""/186029"">The Best Creole Seasoning!</a> in place of the spices listed in the recipe, we like things really hot! I also liked the batter, it fryed up nice and tender! thanks hon!...Kitten:)"
264339,153891,2007-03-03,5,"Excellent!! we all loved it..made exactly as posted EXCEPT I added WAY more than a dash (as suggested because we do like spicey)
also I had a lot of prep work with the rest of my supper tonight so when I cleaned the cauliflower 
I also did the egg,mily, salt thing and as you suggested I did it in a large(galon size) zip lock baggie then added the califlower and stuck it in the fridge for at least 2 hours..at the same time in another LARGE baggie I did the flour and the seasonings...
got all my other supper  close to being done and these went quickly..
I was able to add all the cauliflower to the dry ingredients and it had enough room to really coat well..I do recomend the baggies..NO CLEAN UP!!
these are really good and I found the timing to be about 6 to 7 min...good good good!!!
then these were"
269198,153891,2007-03-19,5,"Loved this recipe. Very tasty. Even my picky 5 year old who won't eat cooked cauliflower only raw with dip ate it. I served with ranch dressing. Had some ranch with taco seasoning mixed in to go with it, also like Lonestar's Amarillo Cheese Fries copycat recipe posted up here. I think I will refrigerate them for awhile though next time, so the breading will be a little better."
316717,153891,2007-06-01,5,"yummy. now i don't have to go to the restaurant and pay $$$ for the fried brocoli, it's so easy. surprisingly very filling too."
254909,153891,2007-10-18,5,"OH yummy!  All four of us, even the one and four year olds, couldn't get enough of these!  Most definitely a repeater."
232190,153891,2007-10-27,4,This was very good.  Not as heavily coated as some places serve it.  I found I liked it with quite a bit of salt after frying.  Using the baggies also kept the mess to a minimum.  Thanks Parsley!
123444,153891,2007-10-30,4,"These were quite good, yet the oregano, or possibly the thyme seemed a little overpowering.  We could not taste the parmesan cheese at all. Next time I think I will increase the parmesan cheese a bit, and cut back on the oregano, and thyme. The two just didn't compliment each other."
407007,153891,2007-11-05,5,"wow! this an outstanding recipe.  I had been looking forward to making this recipe on my day off all week -- and it was well worth the wait! I put half the batch into a bagged caesar salad (got the idea from 'everyday italian' on the food network) and had the other half for snacks. both were great! I didn't have ranch to dip in, but they still were fantastic plain. thanks for a wonderful keeper! looking forward to trying this with other fresh veggies!"
380275,153891,2008-09-17,5,"I've made fried cauliflower before with the dry mixes in the store...boy does this blow those away!  Never again will I buy those.  I did change it up a little since I like things pretty spicy.  I added cayenne pepper drops to the egg mixture and used a ton of garlic and onion powders and put some Pampered Chef ""Chipolte Rub"" in the flour mix.  I also increased the parm & romano cheese blend to about 1/4 cup. I used cheddar cheese soup made with 1/2 a can of milk  to dip this in.  I had to pry myself away!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!"
1049212,153891,2008-11-27,5,"WOW! I have been looking for a recipe for cauliflower.  It was so quick, easy, light and tasty.  My family ate the entire batch.  We served it with ranch dressing which was awesome.  This is a KEEPER!  Thanks."
140132,153891,2008-11-30,5,"I loved these!  I like to order them when we go out but have never attempted them at home.  I chose this recipe and am so glad I did, we enjoyed them very much.  I also use zucchini sticks with this, but it didn't stick as well as the cauliflower.  They were delicious.  Thank you for posting."
305869,153891,2009-12-05,4,"Sooooo good!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the temp seemed a bit too high for the cook time, when we do this again (which will be very soon) we'll try 350 and make sure to use bigger pieces.  Some of mine were too small and the cauliflower pretty much disappeared (which made for little pieces of very tasty deep fried batter, danger :) . Thanks for sharing a perfect combination of flavors and for getting my 5 year old to eat cauliflower!"
1444619,153891,2009-12-22,4,"it was good, i used a small cauliflower head so had plenty of crust with these proportions... i ended up making white cheese sauce, and spreading all over them... i'de do it again, but next time i'de put some of that white sauce inside the egg mixture, in the first step..  thanks!"
126440,153891,2009-12-25,5,I made half a recipe along with other appetizers.  Great flavor.  DH loved it and ate most of them.
134145,153891,2010-03-07,4,"I made this recipe tonight and it was a big hit. I don't have a deep-fryer so I debated whether to bake these or do a shallow pan-fry. I settled in the end for the pan-fry. Some of the flour floated off in the oil, but enough of it stayed on that in the end they were quite tasty, even if they didn't have such a thick coating as one would get with deep fry."
227607,153891,2010-03-16,5,We loved this!  Four of the five kids ate a bunch and the fifth tasted them but did not want anymore.  I loved them and am waiting for hubby to get home to see what he thinks.  Served with ranch.
131021,153891,2010-08-22,5,I really liked the seasoning mixture. I tried it also on some other veggies that I then coated with cracker crumbs and they were a big hit also. I didn't taste the cheese though so I might try it without and with more next time to see if i can taste it.
1972173,153891,2011-07-31,5,"loved this recipe, been looking for one for a while that actually works and tastes good. Have even thought of trying other veggies now to, the only thing is I will add a little more ingredients and leave out the cayenne, being I don't like spicy food. Thanks so much for this recipe."
2117940,153891,2011-12-23,0,I can't wait to try out this recipe. I grew up in upstate NY and always ate deep fried cauliflower when my mother took us to Bernie Murray's for chicken wings. You have to try these with Cocktail Sauce it's the best!
2532510,153891,2014-01-19,0,Definitely not spicy enough.  I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and needed more.  Plus for one full head of cauliflower need to double recipe for both egg mixture and flour mixture.
45900997,153891,2014-01-29,4,"My family has been frying cauliflower for close to 100 years so I would make several suggestions. Cut the cauliflower into tennis ball size chunks. Steam until a fork will barely go in. Cool quickly, you don&#039;t want mushy cauliflower. Mix eggs with a cup of milk. Dip in caulf. and roll in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne. Fry in hot oil. Serve while still hot. Small children will think it&#039;s fried chicken and ask for more."
1802463153,153891,2014-02-07,5,"This is sooo good.  I also grew up going to Bernie Murrays and getting this and wings!  I live in Virginia now and they don&#039;t make it anywhere down here.  I found this recipe and made it for my friend, who also grew up in Elmira, NY, and had this at many restaurants.  She was quite impressed, and loved it.  Her husband who hates cauliflower, also loved it.  It is really good."
1802454235,153891,2014-11-30,5,Very good.  I have an electric stove &amp; set the temp. knob between 6 &amp; 7.  FYI in case you don&#039;t have a  fry thermometer.
2000229403,153891,2015-05-27,5,We enjoyed this recipe very much! I changed it just a bit. I used three eggs and about three times the milk. It came out very light and very delicate flavor definitely doing again.  We enjoyed this recipe very much! I changed it just a bit. I used three eggs and about three times the milk. It came out very light and very delicate flavor definitely doing again.  One other change was we put all the spices in with the wet ingredients then floured.
2001018363,153891,2016-05-19,5,"Fantastic, even kids who don't like cauliflower ate heaps. I didn't have all the herbs but used what I had, will be doing this recipe loads. I tried to serve this with roast lamb, well what was left as they were all eating it up as I was serving, a huge hit and also a great finger food."
2001071031,153891,2016-07-01,5,This is a GREAT recipe! We were doing the cauliflower with chicken wings and dipped the last half dozen wings in the egg and powder and deep fried them. OUTSTANDING!!! Great for both.
2001160214,153891,2016-09-08,0,This was good next time I made it I added more salt and it was just like what you get at the county fair 5 stars!!!!!!
2001415809,153891,2017-03-04,5,"I'm from upstate NY and live in NC, unfortunately I couldn't find fried cauliflower anywhere. This recipe is great! Thank you"
2001473074,153891,2017-04-04,4,This came out really nice and soft. It taste great with garlic sauce!
2001549476,153891,2017-05-22,5,Came put amazing. I used grated mature lactofree cheese and lactofree milk and everyone loved them. I am already craving more!
2001419013,153891,2017-05-27,5,I only needed to fry about 3 minutes at 355F. Needed an extra egg to have enough to coat all of the cauliflower. Subbed almond milk for the 1T milk...probably didn't need it at all. Used the ATK gluten-free flour blend (minus milk powder/sub soy flour). Upped the spices quite a bit. Used homemade vegan parmesan. Covered lightly in BBQ sauce when done and made a vegan ranch dressing. It was a hit! Reminded me of my favorite appetizer at Watercourse Foods!
2002230080,153891,2018-07-26,5,"Yummy!! This was a great recipe. Very easy to make and delicious to enjoy. We tried dipping them in both ranch and marinara, and found that either way is good. Next time we try this one I will add a little more spice the batter to liven it up a bit, nevertheless, very tasty!"
2001966606,153891,2018-10-25,5,Added more cayenne bc I like it spicier and omitted the thyme and oregano. Great taste! Dipped in Blue Cheese
198486,40658,2005-02-26,5,"This is not a review of the recipe.  It is a review of ajvar in the abstract.  I bought some commercial ajvar the other day and was totally taken in by it.  It's kind of a combination of an Indian condiment and a Mexican salsa or mole.  Wonderful on crackers, vegetables or toast.  I would suggest, if you like heat, adding some hot chiles peppers to the other two vegetables.  Haven't tried this recipe, but it seems to match the ingredients well and makes sense.  I'm going to buy some eggplant today."
548123,40658,2007-11-02,4,"Delicious! I have tried commercial brands, and loved them. This one is sweeter than most, but still yummo!"
471652,40658,2008-01-26,5,"This also is not a review of recipe but comment on ajvar. I am currently living in Slovenia and enjoying ajvar immensely.  It is a condiment here, often served with grilled meat.  Most often it is served with a grilled sausage called cevapcici.  I have asked local friends  for the recipe but each family has their own,  secret recipe or simply buy it from  the grocery.  The ajvar aisle is quite extensive!  Thank you for posting this.  I can't wait to try it and have with me  always, even when not in the Balkins."

146356,248015,2007-09-22,5,Just made a double batch. Yummy!  Thanks for sharing this simple but satisfiying recipe.
2586,248015,2007-09-23,5,"Delicious pesto! The only thing I did different was to add 1 Tbsp. of lemon juice. This pesto has a nice, thick consistency and the flavor is outstanding. I like the addition of salt and pepper, as I believe it really enhances the flavor. My basil was a small-leafed variety so it took forever to pick the leaves off the stems. Next year I will plant a larger leafed basil. Other than that, it couldn't be simpler to make."
199697,248015,2008-09-06,3,A reluctant three stars for this pesto.  I used a fully packed 2C basil - right out of the garden.  Used a smidge extra pine nuts all other ingredients to recipe list.  DH and I both agree tooo strong on the basil front - coming from a tried and true basil lover.  Am thinking better measurement might be less basil - or less densly packed .... after all - with these ingredients what's not to like so I'm thinking it must have been just tooo much basil packed into my 2 C measure.  Recommend lightly packing basil to just about 2C measure....Maybe should do the Alton Brown measure by weight with the basil next time...
202661,248015,2008-10-09,5,"This was excellent! A 5 star for sure.  The salt was a perfect addition.  I used 2 cups of basil, and packed it firmly not super tight.  It worked perfectly.  I used raw hazelnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I wouldn't change a thing. Coworkers wiped out a full single batch in about 5 minutes. Good thing I made a double batch.  Robbins EVOO from Solvang, CA was the perfect oil.  It was deliciously fruity and fresh.  Thanks for posting this."
283251,157925,2006-06-16,5,I made these for an appetizer for my friend's wedding. (cut in small wedges) SUPER easy to make and the recipe doubles well. Thanks for sharing! :)
360437,157925,2007-07-06,5,"Very good! I loved the flavor. I pan fried one wedge and baked the rest of them. I think I prefer the pan fried, but both were very good. I did bake them much longer than 20 minutes to get them crispy and golden brown. I served them with chunky mushroom pasta sauce. Yum! Thanks, I'll make this again!"
379453,157925,2007-10-31,4,Will make this again - baked in oven and loved the way it turned out nice and crispy!
69904,157925,2008-06-26,5,"This was yummy!!  I exposed my family to polenta for the first time and it went over well.  = )  I love the fact that I could make it ahead and save myself a lot of rush at dinner time.  I sent this out the door with my dh along with some shrimp marinated in Italian seasonings, so all I had to do was fix a salad and dinner was done.  Fast, simple, and tasty.....you can't ask for much more, except someone else to wash the dishes!  Thanks, Charmie.  Reviewed as part of ZWT 4 Summer '08."
439797,157925,2008-11-22,5,"I really liked this, but no one in my family would eat it.  They are picky."
462279,157925,2009-07-11,5,I used a combination of parmesan and cheddar cheeses and pesto instead of the basil.  I pan fried it and served it with marinara sauce. Absolutely delicious!
449929,157925,2010-04-17,5,These were wonderful!
209920,248649,2008-01-05,5,"These were fabulous! Brought them to work for a potluck & they were gone QUICK! They were liked so much, someone signed me up to bring them again to the next potluck...a month later! Awesome recipe and soooo easy to make!"
231612,248649,2008-03-24,4,"Great flavor! I was surprised by the ingredients but gave them a try anyway and I'm very glad I did. My crockpot is notorious for overcooking things - I may give these another try in a pan sometime and see what result I get. Scorched sauce just does not go well with this recipe! Apart from my personal battles with my crockpot though, I definitely recommend giving this one a try. Thanks for the great idea!"
185446,248649,2010-12-25,5,"Nothing could be easier than making this sauce, and it's a wonderful contrast of tangy flavors.  Next time I will use homemade meatballs.  That was the only drawback to this recipe, and one easily remedied.  Thanks Missysioux for getting me out of the grape jelly rut."
198154,374705,2010-01-02,4,"3 words...quick, easy & delish."
56463,61677,2009-03-27,4,"I enjoyed this carrot salad, but I did find (for my taste) the cinnamon a little strong. I will cut it back to 1/2 tsp next time. Thanks, Carole in Orlando"
482376,456654,2011-09-03,5,Absolutely delicious! The honey was a perfect balance to the balsamic vinegar. This was such a treat for dessert. Who needs cake or pie?! Thank you for posting. Made for Photo Tag.
37449,456654,2013-02-14,5,Yum! Love the contrast in flavor! Made for Vegetarian swap Feb. 2013.
2585084,456654,2013-04-07,5,This recipe  tasted fresh and cool.  It paired well as a light side dish.  I will  be sure to prepare it again.
804550,456654,2013-10-01,5,Wow! I was amazed at how delicious this recipe was. It really enhanced the strawberries that were white on the inside. Made for Veg n Swap tag #62.
260911,55325,2007-03-24,5,Hard to believe this is a health food because it's so tasty. I added 1 small peeled and chopped apple and just a touch of cinnamon.  Can't wait to make it again with peaches. Thanks for sharing!
42586,55325,2003-10-13,5,"I love trying oatmeal recipes because I decided to teach myself to enjoy it.  I've gone way beyond that to truly loving oatmeal, if prepared properly.  This is a great way!  It is different from my baked oatmeal recipe in that it does not get dry like a thick cookie consitency (and has no oil!)  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings and baked in a loaf pan.  I used old fashioned oats.  I love the texture, the grains soft and wet (as you said, jiggly!) but still separate grains instead of the mush that I grew up with.  After cooling my brown sugar topping turned crunchy and was delicious.   I think nice variations could include raisins, apples, walnuts, or cinnamon.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
43514,55325,2004-07-22,5,This will get people who don't like oatmeal to eat it.  Nothing better than a little carmelized sugar.
8688,55325,2005-01-15,5,"I've served breakfast food, (of course) for breakfast, I've served it for brunch, lunch and an occasional supper, but I've never considered serving it for dessert, until now.  This oatmeal is so tasty, I couldn't believe I was eating breakfast food.  Very simple to prepare, and time saving, too. I popped it in the oven, took a shower and then served breakfast. I do have to admit that I did sprinkle a bit more brown sugar on top than recommended, I couldn't resist.  And, I also put a little butter on my serving. Yummy! This is a wonderful recipe that I will be serving often.
.......Ever think of serving oatmeal to overnight guests? : )"
101823,55325,2005-01-16,4,"I cut the recipe in half to serve only Hubby and myself.  I used a small casserole dish, but think that the idea of using a loaf pan (as another reviewer mentioned) would have been better.  My oatmeal had a great flavor, but was not creamy or custardy as I would expect ""creme brulee style"" to suggest.  I did use old fashioned oats, which might have contributed to the heartier consistency.  The caramelized sugar on top is a nice touch.  I added raisins and milk to my bowl.  Hubby ate his with just milk.  Very filling and tasty breakfast."
157248,55325,2005-01-22,5,"I had never had baked oatmeal before trying this recipe, was it ever good! I added a jar of peaches, and reduced the milk to 3c, it was probably a little moister than it should have been, but I loved it, if you are adding fruit, and don't like moist oatmeal, you may want to reduce the milk a bit more. I will definatly make this many more times! Thanks!"
13483,55325,2005-04-26,5,Good and easy.  I did add some chocolate chips and it made this rather desserty!!  And what's wrong with that!!  Thanks peachez
133174,55325,2006-01-08,5,"After seeing Bev's wonderful photo, I knew I had to give this a try.  I reduced the recipe to serve 2 and used Splenda in the dry mix.  The dish was cooked in less time than indicated but possibly was a result of the reduced quantity.  I used the full amount of brown sugar on the top and instead of placing it under the broiler used my brulee torch to caramelize the sugar.  Next time around I think I will add some of the options mentioned as well as reducing the sugar on top.  A delicious recipe!"
37072,55325,2006-04-01,4,This very good and makes a filling breakfast.  I added a little cinnamon and some raisins.  I used less than 1/3 c. of Splenda and found that it could have been a little sweeter for our tastes.
205730,55325,2006-11-17,5,"I love this recipe!  I scaled it for one person, so it cooks in much less time, but I have it very often for breakfast!  Remember to grease/oil your pan, because it will be a crusty mess if you don't (not that I have experience ;)"
333329,55325,2006-11-28,5,"This recipe was easy to prepare and had great taste. I added cinnamon and nutmeg for extra spice. I used a jelly roll pan because my 9 x 13 pan was in use elsewhere. This made for a more dense texture than I would have liked. Next time, I will use the 9 x 13 pan or even a deeper casserole dish to achieve a more custard-like texture. The taste is great though, and everyone loved it."
402559,55325,2007-01-05,5,Excellent flavor and very moist. My 2 year old preferred this to the flavored oatmeal packets. Thanks for sharing.
13796,55325,2007-01-06,3,"Mmm... I thought this was really good. It was a little too sweet for me as I subbed Splenda for the sugar. I added dried fruit so maybe that had something to do with it. I halved the recipe and baked it in a loaf pan. Next time I'll just cut back on both sugars and I know it will be fine.
It was very good."
340576,55325,2007-03-22,5,"This is SO heavenly, and unbelievably easy to make! I added drained, diced peaches -- I'm always trying to sneak fruit or veggies into my kids. I've made it several times now, both with regular sugar & brown sugar, and with  Splenda and Splenda-blend brown sugar. Delicious!"
182624,55325,2007-07-13,3,We really liked this oatmeal.  It's very easy to make and has a good flavor.  It would also be a nice addition to a small brunch menu if you had overnight guests.  We served with fresh blueberries.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
283834,55325,2007-10-23,5,"This is a wonderful Sunday morning meal! I made a double batch last Sunday and refridgerated most of it for breakfasts throughout the week. If you do this, then make sure you add some milk when re-heating it or it will be dry. Also, this makes way more than 4-6 servings. I got easily 15 servings out of a double batch, probably more like 18. So, one batch would be more like 10-12 servings. With a glass of milk it's a full meal! I made it exactly as described but also added some shredded apple and cinnamon and I'm glad I did. Thank you very much!"
205028,55325,2008-02-28,5,Great recipe. I added shredded apples to the recipe. I was wonderful. I had plenty of leftovers for the rest of the week.
841096,55325,2008-06-02,5,"This recipe is delicious!  I substituted 1/3 cup granulated Splenda to make it more Core-friendly.  I still used the brown sugar on top, since that gives it a nice caramelized flavor.  It definitely has the distinctive taste of creme brulee.  And the oatmeal gives it almost a rice pudding-like consistency.  Even my husband liked this, and he hates oatmeal.  Very tasty!"
160974,55325,2008-06-08,5,"This is so fabulous! I did use 1/2 cup of French Vanilla coffee creamer in place of some milk and it added a wonderful flavor. I took this out of the oven about 7 minutes early. Do not overbake or it will not be creamy! I loved that it didn't need minding. This is great warm or cold and we had it for our breakfast, snack, and dessert today!
Update: I make this without the brown sugar and serve warm with blueberry sauce for a hearty snack/dessert.
Roxygirl"
537188,55325,2008-07-05,5,Delicious! I made it for a warm snack lunch...but I also had it cold later on : both ways taste good! Thanks.
134289,55325,2008-07-27,5,Yummy!!  I added cinnamon and 2 very ripe bananas to this recipe.  This recipe is very easy to put together.  I used the old fashioned oatmeal and it worked out fine. Without a doubt I will make this again.
424696,55325,2008-08-31,5,"This is not your traditional ""baked oatmeal"" - cakelike bars.  This was a jazzed up warm gooey oatmeal dish.  We loved it, especially my husband!  We use the recipe #58309 for our baked oatmeal ""bar"" fix and use this one when we are craving traditional cooked oatmeal.  Thanks!"
970864,55325,2008-11-06,5,This is a keeper!  My boyfriend has already asked for it again. A coworker asked for the recipe.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg.
352845,55325,2008-11-09,5,"I am most definitely NOT an oatmeal person, especially those packets.  I went on a search to find a baked oatmeal I might like.   LOVED it!!  I add a shredded apple, some cinnamon, and some toasted almonds.  It was satisfying and warm on this chilly morning.  I'm so glad to have leftovers for the week.  Thanks for a great recipe!!"
522275,55325,2009-04-30,3,"It was just a good (but not spectacular) recipe for baked oatmeal with a brown sugar crust.  I'm sure if I added in all the extras from other reviewers' suggestions, it would be great, though!"
1190532,55325,2009-11-10,2,Sorry this just didn't work for us.
422609,55325,2009-12-15,5,"For me, this is one of those recipes that I will make over and over and over ... maybe adding in different things, like raisins, cranberries, peaches, cherries, chocolate, etc.  Even without any ""add-ins"", I could eat the entire dish when it emerges warm from the oven.  The aroma alone is intoxicating.  Warm, sweet, vanilla-y ... it is just SO good!  Like comfort in a bowl."
722619,55325,2010-01-17,4,"Very good! I downsized the recipe to 2 servings, and I cooked it a lil too long because the center was not 'jiggly' but the taste is still great.  This is a keeper and will make again and had my own spin on it!"
577585,55325,2010-04-05,5,Yum and so easy. I haven't even tried adding fruits or nuts yet.
486725,55325,2010-04-10,5,"I think this is 4.5 stars, but would be 5 if I had used a loaf pan for a half recipe. I usually use an 8x8, but because there is no baking powder in this, it was very thin (I can't believe a beloved brulee topping could ever be too much for me, but it was with such a thin layer!). I love Recipe #189837, so the loaf should make it more like that. I cut back the sugar by 20%, but should have done more for our tastes. I also followed other reviewers and cut back the milk by a third, baked it 25 minutes, and used my brulee torch. Very yummy. Would have served 3-4 for a full recipe."
321999,55325,2010-06-05,4,I don't like oatmeal and still thought this was very good.  It doesn't have that make you gag mushy oatmeal texture and that is great.  It was more like a crisp.  I can't wait to try again with some blueberries mixed in.  I placed in ramikins and baked 40 minutes.
689332,55325,2010-07-16,5,"This was very good! I used less sugar than called for, and it still came out tasting decadent. Very easy with a good texture. Will definitely make again."
43083,55325,2010-08-29,3,Made this today for breakfast for BF and I. He really liked it and I just thought it was ok. Used splenda brown sugar on top which worked out great as well as old fashioned oats. Thanks for sharing.
1800692324,55325,2013-12-12,5,I love this recipe. Oh and blueberries with oatmeal. Thank you. Perhaps banana nut next time.  My wife may like this with peaches. My son with strawberries. The possibilities are endless.
42651,17393,2004-05-16,5,"Before dicing fresh asparagus I steamed the spears then plunged then plunged them in cold water. Next time I might add a pinch of mustard or a tsp of curry paste to the ""sauce"", but as its stands, Becky's recipe is a keeper.  A showy, but simple and easy-to-do recipe. Thank you. "
84038,17393,2005-03-14,4,Very delicious recipe.  The directions however were quite vague for someone not very familiar with how to make a souffle.  I also quickly steamed the asparagus before adding to the souffle.  Thanks for the recipe!
167225,17393,2006-02-17,3,"This worked well as a souffle -- puffed nicely and everything. It didn't say how fine to dice the asparagus. I think mine was in about 1/2 inch pieces. So there was plain souffle, which you really have to eat right away before it collapses, and chunks of asparagus that got much hotter. Elegant use of simple ingredients, though."
6357,91544,2004-05-22,5,I substituted the sour cream with plain fat-free yogurt and made this. IT WAS GREAT!:)
207176,91544,2007-03-03,5,My Mom has been having this for breakfast since I was a kid.  I hated sour cream then but now...I can eat it plain right out of the container!  I like this without the strawberries too. I use about 2 heaping dollops of sour cream to 1 sliced banana.  I'm having it now!
163112,513585,2014-03-01,5,"Very fast, easy &amp; delicious!  Bananas are quite filling &amp; 1 16oz glass filled me up.  I used 2 skimpy TBs boring white sugar &amp; a small splash of my diminishing supply of vanilla extract.  I didn&#039;t use almond in case dd wanted some.  A great idea for a busy morning!  Made for A Culinary Tour of Yemen in the NA/ME Forum 2/14."
2324285,513585,2014-03-01,5,"Really tasty and easy.  I froze the bananas the day before, so when I blended everything together the drink had the texture of milkshake.  Just as good, but healthier!  I used about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, as my bananas were not very ripe.  I will probably make this again."
226863,513585,2014-03-29,5,"This was very good.  I made with one frozen banana, and used vanilla soy milk.  Delicious breakfast smoothie.  Thanks for sharing."
469903,268202,2009-03-29,5,"Must try for those who love apples and cheese together - and that would be me!! I did mine on whole wheat soft pita using a panini press and loved it. The directions are confusing because they refer to recipe#268183 in directions #1-6 - just skip to #7 if you just want the sandwich part. I went ahead and made the slaw since I had the stuff already on hand but it certainly isn't necessary to enjoy this yummy apple/cheese quesadilla. Instead of butter, I used non-stick spray and fat-free cheddar for the cheese - great combo!  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2009."
131126,89213,2006-11-13,4,"I often make breakfast for dinner and used your recipe in omelettes last night. I ended up with three very generously stuffed omlettes by the time I added cheese, tomatoes, and jalapenos.  This might be terrific on burgers and topped with cheese too.  Thank you for sharing the idea and recipe!    "
80353,305687,2008-06-18,5,"Scaled to half and thoroughly enjoyed.  The raisins are unusual, but good.  I used sultanas."
185293,135545,2005-09-14,5,OMG this is just so good!  I did everything exactly as posted but added some cheddar cheese to the top for the last 5 minutes.  Heavenly!!  Thanks so much for posting! 
1460352,135545,2010-05-31,5,Awesome.  I made this for Mothers Day brunch for 30 and it was gone.  Everyone wanted the receipe and I have been instructed to make for all family gatherings.  Great for a crowd.
341142,178187,2007-02-14,3,"I liked this but didn't think the flavour was intense enough. Tated a bit 'watery' The recipe didn't say what kind of apples so I used Golden Delicious. I'm from the Caribbean so I am not very knowlegable about apples, maybe a different variety would have given a sweeter filling."
242729,178187,2009-03-19,4,"Pat - this was GREAT! Spiced and NOT too sweet, which is the way I like it! I am awarding stars now, based on me tasting this straight out of the saucepan, I have yet to make a pie with it!! When I do, I will come back and add more notes. I used Pink Lady apples and left the skin on for added crunch and colour.Made for Holiday Tag, merci encore ma leeetle sweet pea! FT:-) Edited to add - I used this pie filling as a topping for a baked sponge pudding, it was great, as the apples were still whole pieces and not mush! We liked the spicy flavour and the fact that this recipe has no sugar in it. 19/03/2009"
284897,178187,2010-06-18,5,"I made the filling only, as I already had some pastry to use up. 
I followed recipe exactly (well nearly) One exception I did the apples in the microwave. I did use golden delicious apples which are a little tart to start with.
Now here is where it gets tricky......... DH is diabetic, and so I placed half of the apples (as per recipe) on one half of the pie, the other half I added sugar to the apples before putting them into the pie....... this was for the rest of the family.
So ........... It is hard to rate this recipe.
DH enjoyed his a lot, but he did say it needed some ice-cream with it! The rest of the family loved there half...ME I had a little of bith sides, and yes the sugarless side was very bland and not sweet at all, but the other side was delicious, and the extra sugar was what it needed.
BUT the main thing is, DH who isn't used to much sugar loved his and the others loved theirs and they also had it with ice=cream.
Pat I think this is a great recipe with wonderful flavours and spices for a diiabetic and if you are not diabetic then maybe add some sugar for a little extra sweetness! OR do my trick to suit everyone, ( Yes.....I really need to get a life.) lol
So with all that long winded story everyone enjoyed their share here, and I guess all I can say is ......Whateva floats ya boat, with this recipe....lol
Thanks Pat, we loved it!"
573325,178187,2011-02-17,5,"Simply wonderful! So easy to prepare and soooooooo delicious! Mmm, the cloves and cinnamon add a wonderful warm touch and are the perfect addition to this fruity filling. Mmmm!<br/>I actually used the filling in an apple tiramisu, which turned out really, really great and I think its all thanks to your wonderful apple recipe. I will use this for all my pie fillings and applesauces from now on, theres none I have liked better.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this wonderful, wonderful recipe with us, Pat!<br/>Made and reviewed for WTTM Tag February 2011."
593927,178187,2011-09-29,5,"I loved the fact that this contained no added sugar which I try to avoid. I liked the spices! I used mainly Macintosh apples and it turned into apple sauce almost immediately after I decided to covered it. I was not sure if I was supposed to but apple sauce was just fine as I used it in and on recipe#447114 also tasted it alone and it was good, but I am used to healthy tasting recipes. I used freshly squeezed lemon juice. I would make this as apple sauce or otherwise again. Made for ALMOST 5 GAME."
107308,95611,2004-07-23,4,"Okra lovers will enjoy the ease and simplicity of this dish.  It was tasty, but not as crisp as fried okra.  I did appreciate not having the mess I create with frying.  I used frozen okra, but next time will try fresh because I think it will be crisper. By the way, I have driven through Clarendon, TX many, many times being an old Texas Panhandle girl myself! "
131674,95611,2008-08-04,3,This was an easy way to prepare okra but my family thought it was dry.  I used fresh okra from my garden.  Thanks for sharing.
768828,95611,2009-02-23,4,"I've made this several times and have neglected to write a review.  I sometimes use flour instead of cornmeal and spray with butter flavored Pam.  While it doesn't get as crisp as I would like, it is much easier and healthier than frying.  Thanks for the recipe."
2691018,95611,2013-02-12,0,"Ruby is my great grandmother.  I love all my memories of her cooking in her big ol' home, dinner buffets and most of all her taking us to get a dipped cone at Dairy Queen and the people in the drive through always refusing to let her pay.  Not only was she a phenomenal cook, but a wonderful woman of God, always helping those in her community.  I pray I can be 1/2 the lady she was."
443633,53079,2009-10-25,4,Very good. We will definitely make it again.
868583,249042,2008-12-01,5,"My daughter make these for our family.  They were absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved them and ate every one.  Thank you Mrs.""You-Mixed-What-With-What?""!!"
1294056,249042,2009-09-27,5,This recipe made a very nice basic crepe.  I chose to fill my crepes with chocolate nutella and bananas that I pan fried in margarine.  It was very tasty.  Made for Fall 2009 PAC.
1465713,249042,2009-11-29,5,"These crepes are super easy and delicious! This recipe is almost identical to the crepes I usually make - the only difference is that I add 2 tablespoons of sugar, as I usually make sweet rather than savory crepes."
2179551,249042,2014-07-29,5,I love this recipe! Adding a little nutella on top when finished makes for a mouthwatering flavor! Thanks for the great recipe!
1802849661,249042,2016-02-02,5,"Such a great recipe to have in your arsenal! I topped ours with fresh lemon juice, zest and some cream. An easy treat that looks harder than it is!"
2000323169,249042,2017-05-16,5,Turned out great! Soft and perfect!

I think these would be great for sandwiches too.  Maybe chicken salad?   I did cut back a bit on the salt,  due to the salt in the bacon and the self-rising flour.  Still delicious!  Thank you 2Bleu, this is a wonderful recipe I will be making again.  Made for PRMR Tag"
1052065,364342,2009-12-30,5,I made these on a whim. super doable and delicious. I was lazy and  used a package of real bacon bits.These turned out perfect. Yum!Thanks for sharing 2Bleu!
225372,122077,2005-09-13,5,"Lovely, and very different. I recommend using very ripe bananas, mine were only just ripe and the lemon juice almost over took their flavour. Very nice though."
350076,122077,2006-09-19,5,"This jam is amazing! Quick and easy to make, then only downside being it is a weird colour and seems to take ages to thicken (but then I think everything takes ages when I'm hungry!). Tastes great warm, but nicer cold on toast. I halved the recipe and got a 400g jam full. It seems to keep well in the fridge also. Thanks for the recipe!"
422778,122077,2007-10-21,5,"taste and calories just right .
great jam."
1015482,122077,2009-04-07,4,Simple and easy. I made some sub par banana bread and this made it perfect. Not too sweet and quick to make. Thanks. 4 cups of bananas was 12 bananas for me.
412115,122077,2009-07-21,5,Great recipe!  Tasty and simple enough for someone new to canning (i.e. me).
313633,165438,2006-06-28,4,"This was a very nice cake. My family loved it. We made it with orange juice and topped it with orange icing. Thanks and we will make this again.

844554,165438,2014-04-16,5,Talk about a good cake! This one is it. Tasted so rich (probably all the butter and sugar) and it rose so high in the 9x13 pan. I&#039;m taking it in to hubby&#039;s work and I know they&#039;ll love it. Unfortunately I had to leave out the raisins because I didn&#039;t have any but it was still so good! Made for PAC Spring 2014.
130663,213681,2009-04-18,5,Very nice bread.I omited the nuts as hubby didn't want any.
25090,15017,2001-12-03,4,The flavors of this recipe are good and it is nice for your whole family to be able to eat french toast at once.  The recipe is very fat rich and caloric though.  Here are some tips for reducing it. Skip the cream cheese altogether (I did this by accident and it came out very well).  Use egg beaters or 3 whole eggs and 6 whites.  Cut the butter down to 1/3 cup.
59753,15017,2002-12-10,5,Served this for the day after Thanksgiving brunch and everyone loved it!  Easy to make and tasted delicous.  Had leftovers for desert warmed with vanilla ice-cream on top.  Now that is a versitile dish!
25356,15017,2003-02-28,2,"Maybe I did something wrong (I MUST have)but it just didn't turn out right. It was extremely watery and just not good. I will try this again (I'm not going to  give it up without a fight! LOL), though and leave the cream cheese out completely (just didn't like it) and instead of pouring the egg mixture over the top, maybe I'll dip the bread THEN place in the pan...to cut back on the amount of ""liquid"". Thanks!"
18391,15017,2005-01-17,5,"Excellent! I increased the amount of sugar because my husband likes his french toast very sweet, otherwise made exactly as stated .. thank you!!"
167003,15017,2005-02-09,4,"This is yet another supurb recipe by Mirj.  I too however felt it was fat rich and i'm really lazy at times so I was looking to simplify an already simple recipe.  First, I omitted all the butter from this recipe. I used Pam to spray the pan and used no butter in the sugar apple mixture.  I sprinkled the brown sugar and most of the cinnamon into the bottom of the pan, I used fat free cream cheese.  For the apples I used canned apple pie filling, scantly.... I tried not to use too much of the ""filling"" mainly just the apples.  Canned apples worked well too.  Remember if you use the pie filling it is sweetened and spiced.  So you should cut down the sugar in the recipe accordingly.  To solve the 'soggy' issue another cook had, I used french bread from the store bakery.  I took the loaves and cut the bread very very thick 3-4 inches, after it had set out in over night (in slices is best).  The thick bread sucked up the egg mixture very quickly and I almost could have used more... but it was just right.  Thanks for the great recipe Mirj... from one lazy cook :)"
433922,15017,2007-09-02,3,This was easy to make because you can make most of it before you go to bed but not convenient for a weekday morning because of the baking.
199228,118103,2005-05-02,5,OMG! This waS AWESOME and deserves more than 5 stars! I made it for my son's birthday party and all the adults ate this up! Did not last long....next time I am doubling the recipe~
258806,118103,2005-12-18,5,Fantastic! I made this on the spur of the moment for my church group and everyone loved it! I added shredded parmesan cheese to the cream cheese mixture and put provelone on top instead of cheddar cheese since I didn't have any on hand but it was excellent anyway. I will be making this again! Thanks so much!
55623,118103,2005-12-27,5,This was excellent.  The only change I would make is maybe add parmesan cheese to the spinach mixture to give more flavor.  It was very simple and very pretty.  Thanks!
407007,118103,2008-01-02,4,"this was good, but a tad bit too garlicky for my tastes and how I like my spinach dip. I loved putting this in my food processor and the texture/look it gave the dip. I mixed most of the cheddar cheese in and just topped off a pinchful full. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. thanks for sharing the recipe!"
538098,118103,2008-08-09,5,"Fabulous!  I had less cream cheese than I thought, so I used half sour cream...still turned out wonderfully."
370580,118103,2008-11-19,5,"excellant, this went over so well at our party! It was the first dish eaten!!!!I did add 1/4 cup of parmasean cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper."
1178784,118103,2009-02-21,5,I have made this for the second time and I only used half of the pkg. of spinach...to my husband and I it was even more like Montana's than the first time! I did add the parmesan cheese too.  Absolutely delicious!!
710842,118103,2009-06-30,4,"Great way to sneak in spinach into meal as an appetizer.

I too ended up adding paremsan cheese and more tabasco sauce as it was a little bland without, it but it was addictive and it went quickly.  

This would be great to make to take to a potluck or carry-in as it is different and more hearty than the standard spinach-artichoke cold to room temperature commercial dips."
2001686897,118103,2017-08-25,5,I made a double servings and I wished that I made more didn't last throw the party could of used about 10 more bowls.
1668482,53079,2010-10-27,5,"The entire family loved it. Quick and easy, had everything needed on hand!"
130663,53079,2013-03-14,5,"Used haddock and very little paprika. Very good,we&#039;ii make again."
262966,299296,2008-04-20,4,I just made this tonight and it's delicious!!  You could really switch it up too and use all different kinds of veggies.  Adding some ham or bacon would definitely be good.
8377,299296,2010-06-06,5,"Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I made it as posted just added a little extra cheese. I cut the asparagus first, quickly blanched, then iced them. They were the perfect crispness when the dish was baked. Great recipe!"
1329782,299296,2010-06-14,5,"I didn't exactly make this from your recipe on Zaar but made it from Rachel Ray.  I had saved it but ever had made it. I had some extra asparagus and wanted to make breakfast.  This is what I used this am.  Then looking through some posts this morning, I found this listed as a recipe someone suggested for ""Creative with Asparagus."" This is really a great easy recipe and takes no time.  I did have some proscuitto and shallots on hand and added a small amount of each. About 1/2 cup each. The bright cream asparagus with the puffy type of base was just great. I suggest gruyere which is what I used, but swiss would also work. Personally, I would use a cheddar.  But as another reviewer mentioned, you can easily use other vegetables and other cheese combinations.  It was great ... and even though I didn't see yours posted first, I wanted to mention what a nice recipe it was. Breakfast, Lunch, or as a nice side dish along side some baked salmon would be wonderful, or just alone with a salad for dinner.  Really good, thx for listing it here."
1179225,299296,2011-02-15,5,"This is a really nice dish. I used pepper jack cheese and would use it again. The flavor from the asparagus really came through. I was afraid the batter may be to heavy, but it wasn't. Served with salad and grilled chicken. Looking forward to making this again with different veggies and seasonings. Thanks so much for posting!"
315565,370966,2010-02-14,5,Delicious comfort food and very easy to do. I swirled vanilla yoghurt through mine - fabulous breakfast !!!!
678366,370966,2010-02-16,5,Made this for DDs dinner. I liked the addition of flour as a thickener and also the apples.Thanks for sharing.
2000009565,370966,2018-02-17,0,"My mom is 97 and I am her caretaker. We eat as healthfully as possible without being extreme and without feeling deprived of good things to eat. I plan to make some of this pudding tonight or tomorrow night with the following tweaks for health and even more flavor! 1. I will use a partial pot of leftover pot of mixed brown rice and quinoa. 2. I will use coconut oil in place of butter. 3. I will sweeten it with the apple and around a tablespoon of maple syrup. No other sugar. 4. I will omit the flour to thicken it. I might take about half the rice and blend it up on my blender to thicken the pudding. I will see how it looks first. I may just blend it all up to make it soft and creamy. I will see what it is like before I make this decision. 5. I will probably add some nutmeg along with the cinnamon just for wonderful flavor. 6. I will add some toasted walnuts. 7. I will use unsweetened almond milk in place of the non fat milk. It has vanilla in it (which is what my mother likes) but I will add the vanilla in the recipe anyway because we love vanilla. 8. This one I am not certain of yet. It depends upon my mother's response when I suggest it: a tablespoon or so of candied ginger snipped into tiny bits. It will be delicious, but it will be spicy and I want to be sure my mom is in the mood for it. 7. I will serve it warm with a dollop of sour cream. (My mom prefers sour cream to yogurt!). I will taste hers and probably put a dollop of plain yogurt on mine. It would make a superb breakfast, but we will use it as dessert I will write about the results."
186802,140850,2005-11-08,5,"This turned out delicious.  The only thing I didn't do was use walnut, because I didn't have any at the time.  Thank you."
296097,140850,2006-10-08,5,"This cake was very good.  Easy to make.
The only thing I would do different next time is cut my apple slices a little bit smaller.  Very good flavor -will definately make again.  my family loved it.  Thank you!
"
418210,140850,2007-01-08,5,"Yum! Tastes a lot more complex and decadent than expected. I used Splenda and halved the oil content and substituted it with a 1/2 cup of chunky applesauce, to cut down on the fat. I baked it in a large cast-iron skillet and it came out wonderfully.  I'll be making this one often, it's the best coffee cake I've had so far."
396497,140850,2007-09-13,2,"I was excited to make this being as though I have a lot of extra apples on hand and it seemed fairly easy.  I did not like the floury taste that resulted as a lack of spice and flavor.  Maybe next time I will add pumpkin, more spice, or something else.  I even added a ""strudel"" topping and it still tasted like apple flour."
548406,140850,2007-09-21,2,"These didn't turn out like i expected them to. i followed the recipe exactly, but it still turned out to be very dry."
178879,350896,2009-03-24,5,"This actually tastes very good.  I had some soy milk in my fridge that was due to expire in the next few days.  I do like soy milk, but haven't been able to use this carton up fast enough, so I went looking for a recipe.  I actually had 2 bananas in the freezer, so this suited me perfect!  I used plain 8th continent soy milk in this recipe and just some regular vanilla (imitation even!) extract.  Everything else was as written.  It has a slightly lighter texture than pudding which reminds me of homemade tapioca (with the egg whites folded in).  I think anyone would enjoy this pudding and would have no clue it was soy!"
305664,104089,2006-09-14,4,I really enjoyed this. It was VERY easy and smelled nice while baking. I will be doing this again! Thank you!
9869,100864,2005-05-16,5,"I used granny smith apples..followed the recipe exactly as written and out of the oven came the most delicious apple crisp I have ever tried, love the crunchy texture and flavours. I served with a swirl of cream.
Comfort food at its best."
163112,100864,2005-05-19,5,"I made this with strawberries!!  The whole thing was gobbled up in a heartbeat.  I used about 4c of berries but next time will use at least 8c. Even my daughter who 'doesn't like fruit' loved it!  So fast, easy & delicious!!!"
122993,100864,2005-05-19,4,"I made this with apples. It was good, but the topping was a bit to crunchy...so we added some pats of butter on the top and that seems to soften it up a bit. I will make this again...I'll have to try it with peaches!"
58836,100864,2005-07-04,5,Had an abundance of peaches so decided to make this using them.  Turned out great.  Even better topped with vanilla ice cream! yum yum!!
91392,100864,2006-08-15,5,Used fresh peaches.  Just excellent.  Will use this recipe for the topping for any number of different kinds of fruit.  Looking forward to trying it with cherries.
119466,100864,2006-09-22,5,"I had been craving apple crisp, so I made this recipe as one of my choices for the Pick A Chef game. I scaled the recipe to half, using 2 Granny Smith apples and 2 Braeburns. It was delicious and really hit the spot--thanks for posting! "
168462,100864,2006-09-23,5,I made this as written except I added some pecan pieces on top of the apples. My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.
366118,100864,2006-11-19,5,This was really easy to make and really good. I cut down the sugar a bit. Thanks Hadice!
86318,100864,2007-01-15,4,"This is good, but I'm embarrassed to say I would have preferred cinnamon only, rather than the cinnamon/nutmeg mix here. I have enjoyed these same two spices in these proportions in a quick bread, so expected to like them here, too. The apple crisp is also quite sweet - this may have been my fault for not allowing for the sweetness of the fuji apples I used. Thank you for helping me define my preferences."
130395,100864,2007-09-18,5,What A Winner.I don't really care for Nutmeg so I subbed for Apple pie spice. Excellent recipe.
199792,100864,2008-03-31,4,This was a quick and easy crisp that everyone seemed to enjoy. It did not give me the chunky crispy oatmeal topping that I expected but it was nice. I only used a pinch of nutmeg but did go with the cinnamon. I used peaches and at this time of year it had to be canned. I will try it again with fresh. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
521211,100864,2008-11-08,5,I've made this apple crisp many times and love this recipe.  It's simple and delicious.
744939,100864,2009-02-14,5,I made this with fresh blueberries that I had frozen and it came out as well as if I had used fresh!  We loved this warm out of the oven with some ice cream on top!
723491,100864,2009-03-06,5,5 stars all the way for this yummy quick to make and even quicker to eat dessert.  We loved it with a big dollop of ice cream on the side!
932620,273316,2010-06-27,5,"An easy-peezy recipe!   Made these with my after-school program for our end of year party.   The cookie has a light sweetness and the dough was easy to work with.  I decorated them using a technique from a Martha Stewart Kids mag.
This is a keeper!"
1679850,273316,2010-10-31,5,"Such a good recipe!  I hope to find one perhaps a tad healthier, but this was one is delicious.  It wasn't too easy for me since a mixer is one item I decided I couldn't give room to in my super tiny apartment, but it was still possible to make by hand - just took some more time and work.  I made them on Friday and they're still tasting great and not stale on Sunday!"
1803538260,273316,2014-12-24,1,This one was NOT very tasty. :(
1144987,100864,2009-08-10,5,"We found this to be delicious!  It took longer than the prep time suggests, probably because of the use of fresh peaches (which have to be peeled), but we all enjoyed the result.  It was not too sweet and was excellent with ice cream.  By the way, we do not have a pastry cutter but had no problem as we cut the butter into little pieces and then worked everything together by hand."
483932,100864,2009-10-19,4,Very good. I cut this in half and made exactly as written with the apples. Served with vanilla ice cream.
15521,100864,2010-01-12,5,"This was an excellent apple crisp.  I chose it because it served 8 instead of 4 or 6, but I will make it again because it was so good.  The flavors were jusr right and I liked that it wasn't syrupy.  The fresh apple taste came through clearly.  I used 7 large apples and it made 10 - 12 large servings for me.  .  Thanks so much!"
679759,100864,2010-04-15,5,We loved this recipe...the nutmeg really was a wonderful treat and not something I usually put in apple crisp.  Great recipe..thanks!  Going to try it with peaches when they are in season...maybe blackberries too!
274467,100864,2011-09-12,5,"I have made quite a few different apple crisp recipes and this one wins! Crispy, crunchy topping, not too sweet, not soupy or runny. Perfect. We ate it warm with whipped cream on top. Delicious!"
303700,100864,2011-10-03,5,So easy...will definitely try it out with Peaches next....YUMMM!
176615,100864,2012-02-05,5,"Excellent! Made this with apples and we loved it. The perfect amount of topping. Makes a large pan, therefore an excellent way to clear out the beat up apples from my apple drawer. Looking forward to the peach version next. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
226863,100864,2012-06-17,5,"I used peaches, and cut it down to 4 peaches.  So I used a smaller shallow pan, and loved the wonderful crisp!  I think I'll add some of this to my oatmeal in the morning and enjoy it in a new way!  Love it with vanilla ice cream warm from the oven.  Thanks for sharing!"
2148727,100864,2013-06-28,5,"amazing! so easy and so delicious, a household favorite:)"
2918668,100864,2013-07-27,5,I have been making apple crisp for years. Very seldom do I find a recipie I want to use again. This is a good one!
1162224,100864,2013-12-20,5,"Out of all the apple crisp recipes I&#039;ve tried, this is the BEST!!!!!!!  Great fruit to topping ratio and the topping came out nice and crunchy and the apples weren&#039;t mushy.  This is the only apple crisp recipe I will use from now on!!!!!"
2198343,100864,2014-07-02,0,We  used less sugar and no nutmeg and it was a delicious crisp.
2109227,100864,2014-10-19,5,"Delicious!  I split the topping from the recipe out into two crisps in smaller dishes, one with fresh sliced peaches and the other with apples.  Absolutely loved it, I did need to bake them 10 minutes longer to get the top super crispy....but that is just a personal preference of mine.  Try this recipe you will be glad you did."
1803677177,100864,2015-01-25,4,"I adapted this for a bit more flavor (we&#039;re serious about cinnamon! also, the apples weren&#039;t ideal but they needed using), for a lot less sugar, and for no wheat or gluten.&lt;br/&gt;I also changed the preparation method slightly: &lt;br/&gt;* For brown sugar, I substituted 1-1/4 cup stevia powder, plus 1/4 cup of molasses (added the molasses later, with the butter).&lt;br/&gt;* For 1 tsp cinnamon plus 1 tsp nutmeg, I substituted 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp white pepper. (This may have been too much, even for our spice-loving family, if it had all gone into the crumb topping.)&lt;br/&gt;* For 1 c flour, I substituted a half-cup each of almond flour and sorghum flour. (I could have just used sorghum flour or rice flour or all-purpose gluten-free flour, or even buckwheat flour, which goes well with oats. Don&#039;t try using coconut flour as a straight substitute for anything else ever, though; that&#039;s weird stuff, needs it&#039;s own recipe.) &lt;br/&gt;* When I sliced the apples, each set of slices got dumped into a bowl of water with lemon juice, right away, to keep them from browning.&lt;br/&gt;* Next, while the oven pre-heated,  I mixed the spices into the stevia powder -- before beginning to layer the apple slices. Before the first layer, a thin scattering of spiced sweetener powder went into the pan; then, after each layer was completed, another thin scattering on top. &lt;br/&gt;* Then, the flours got stirred into the sweetener, and the oats, then the molasses and the butter.&lt;br/&gt;I could have used less butter, as it doesn&#039;t take much of anything to dissolve the stevia powder, but I didn&#039;t, so the &quot;crumble&quot; was a little on the moist side.  It took a little work to keep it crumbly instead of forming a nearly solid crust (not that there is anything wrong with a solid crust! if anybody goes in that direction, though, remember to leave some vents so the dish can easily let off steam). It turned out pretty well! Next time, we will use more oats in the topping. Also, if we have some cranberries or blackberries, we&#039;ll add a handful or two of those and back off on the spices, for a different twist."
2000041789,100864,2015-03-05,0,so great
2942654,100864,2015-10-09,5,"I have been trying to find a great Apple Crisp recipe for years and now I don&#039;t need to look any further! It&#039;s so easy to make and memorize. Most importantly, it doesn&#039;t turn out soupy. The crumble is crunchy and flavorful. My friends loved it! I find that using Granny Smith apples for baking is best--especially if you prefer tart and sweet. Excited to make this one again and again!"
593835,100864,2015-11-02,2,"I carefully read all the reviews and thought, &quot;how could I go wrong?&quot;  This did not turn out for me as the others reported.  It was way too sweet.  Even though there was no sugar mixed with the apples, the 1-1/2 cups of brown sugar was too much.  The topping was not crunchy at all, it was almost dry.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a large oval Pyrex dish to bake it in."
2000645615,100864,2015-11-06,5,"Excellent and easy to make apple crisp.  Since it&#039;s just me and my husband, I divided the recipe between two disposable pie pans and froze one for later (we&#039;ll see how that turns out).  We&#039;re trying to eat healthier, so I made a couple of tweaks--for the flour, I used half whole wheat and for the butter, I used the Earth Balance Buttery Spread that works for baking.  It was delicious--I especially loved the flavors of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  My husband loved it, too--this one&#039;s a winner."
2000656899,100864,2015-11-08,0,"Sorry, this was one of the worst apple crisps I&#039;ve ever made. The crumble on top was just that a lot of crumble. I won&#039;t even give a star rating."
2000712172,100864,2015-11-25,1,I found this to be too dry. Will never make it again.
2000805160,100864,2016-03-23,0,"Wow! So easy to make, the best apple crisp!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I served it with vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce it was Yum!  The only changed i made in this recipe is the sugar, i add 2 tablespoon of mascuvado sugar and the topping 1 tablespoon only.  Its a keeper."
2001005709,100864,2016-05-09,5,"Excellent! I had a lot of apples to use up, and this did the trick. Very tasty. I'm not a nutmeg fan, so I omitted that, but that's the only change I made. The whole pan was gone in 2 days."
2001207659,100864,2016-10-15,5,I love that i change portion control My husband even helped make it
2001227692,100864,2016-10-31,3,"Fruit/Topping ratio very good. Taste, very good. Texture very bad. Loose and powdery topping. 1/2 cup butter, even well blend is inadequate. Needs minimum 3/4cup and optimally 1 full cup to coat and crispin dry ingredients. So dry that even additional baking time would not help!"
2001605700,100864,2017-06-30,4,The recipe is great EXCEPT for the nutmeg. Next time I will be omitting it. It's very overpowering in this recipe.
493093,100864,2017-07-01,1,I guess if you like gummy oats (like in an oatmeal cookie -yuck) you might like this recipe. Has a seriously large pile of sugar too.
2001652865,100864,2017-08-02,1,"I disappointed myself today as I tried to make this for a luncheon at work, so I was naturally in a hurry and I for got to use the brown sugar. So sad. So I am wondering if I just melt the brown sugar and add what dry ingredients I can get into the pan if that might work just as good."
2002099131,100864,2018-04-06,5,"I remember making nearly this exact recipe for a certain fast-casual dining establishment on the east coast that’s no longer in business. As the restaurant manager, I had to set the par for how many to always have on hand, and it never seemed to be enough. I’d get us set with a number that would do ok for a couple weeks then suddenly it wasn’t enough. These were the most popular item on the menu next to the chicken itself."
2002274032,100864,2018-09-13,5,Excellent recipe! So easy! So tasty!
400708,100864,2018-11-12,5,"Fast, easy and oh so good, I even made a HUGE mistake; forgot to put in the brown sugar and had dumped the mix on the apples when I remembered. Had to pull out the apples, add the sugar and then repour on top; whew - even with that big error it turned out delicious and my whole family loved it. Thanks so much for posting this wonderful fall recipe"
322326,147289,2007-05-19,4,I used vanilla ice cream with vanilla pods in it. This was really yummy. The maple syrup realy adds to the taste. Thanks for posting. Miss Pixie x x x :D
80353,64709,2003-07-23,5,"Very nicely flavoured vinegar, perfect for mixed greens."
166609,117477,2005-07-29,5,"Delicious! Since I like a little more crunch to my snacks, I sprinkled some uncooked oats on top of crunchy peanut butter...and who's says I won't try a few raisins with the banana next time - for some added fiber!"
252514,117477,2013-03-10,5,"This is my new favorite snack. I usually warm the tortilla in a pan to soften it a bit so the peanut butter spreads easily. This comes together quick and is a great substitute for a morning muffin or scone if I don't feel like baking that week. Thanks, ThatBobbieGirl! [Made for Zaar Alphabet Soup]"
344231,189416,2007-07-09,5,Best Pina Colada smoothie I have EVER had!!! The girls just went NUTS for this!!! Oldest daughter (age 17)just raved and raved... (:
443975,189416,2008-04-13,4,This was great - tasted terrific!  I did add a tablespoon of sugar to round out the flavour. Thanks for a good recipe!
463202,189416,2010-04-28,4,Awesome!  This was a yummy treat to use up some leftover coconut cream and pineapple.  Thanks for posting. :)
5060,166376,2009-11-23,5,"Lovely different way to serve asparagus, we loved it.  I didn't precook the asparagus , we like it crisp and I was afraid it would get mushy, so I laid it in the dish raw and glad I did.  Turned out perfect,  I did add a little black pepper and left out the extra egg white as I was using an extra large egg.  Just made two servings.  I will make it again, thanks for posting."
325910,166376,2012-02-15,4,"Tastes good.    It took at least 10 extra minutes in the oven to brown on top.  After the time listed it was not at all cooked.  I used a glass loaf pan, but the oven was preheated and I use an oven thermometer -- so not sure what the hang up was."
377070,166376,2012-02-19,4,This is a nice way to dress up asparagus.  Great tip  by Derf to not precook the asparagus - it's perfectly done when cooked from raw.  Next time I will add some dry white wine and perhaps some red pepper flakes just to enhance the flavours.
48859,77911,2012-03-10,5,"Excellent!!  Was surprised this hasn't been rated before! I had some apples that were aging, and was looking for a recipe w/o vanilla ice cream since I forgot to get it...  Once again another great recipe!!"
1925885,77911,2013-01-09,5,"Wow!!!  This was definitely, as you say, a WINNER!!!  The cake was so easy to make and it comes out super moist.  It made the house smell heavenly, and almost didn't make it to the cool down stage...  The sauce was also very very tasty - I could see making the sauce by itself to serve over ice cream or other desserts.  Thanks for another wonderful recipe!"
1220448,77911,2013-08-01,4,Tasted great but after baking just as directed the middle of the cake sunk in which did not make for a nice presentation.
1304132,393664,2010-05-29,5,"These cookies are amazing! They were more like cream cheese bars because the cream cheese on the top was still a little too soft to eat with your hands. I made them a couple days ago and they were a huge hit! I did alter them a little by not adding the raisins, lemon juice, and nutmeg and substituted with cinnamon and a little rum. They are a little sweet but YUMMY! Thank you!"
6357,35669,2003-06-02,5,Wonderful! This had a nice citrus taste(coming from the oranges). I was in the mood for a fruit snack and I had one banana right before my eyes and a coconut too! Lol. It didnt take time to make this...I would love to eat this again! It's so sad when your waistline doesn't permit you to eat as your heart pleases...sigh!! I will make this again after I shed some pounds:)
679649,159203,2007-12-28,5,"I absolutely loved this.  I put the anise in with the milk so that it would be a stronger anise flavor. I crushed the seeds using a mortar and pestle which left some of it ground up.  I strained the mixture through a fine sifter but the ground anise came through and was quite delicious.  Oh, I drank it hot :)"
11297,135403,2005-09-27,4,Even with only marinating this for 8hours before cooking it was delicious.  I can only imagine how much better it would be with marinating for the full 24hours. I also cooked this in the oven at 200'C for 20mins.  Thanks for posting such this easy recipe:)
67656,135403,2007-04-06,5,"My love of pork tenderloin continues with this recipe.  The marinade was a  perfect balance between the tart, spicy and sweet.  Not too much honey as is often the case in recipes which combine honey & mustard.  I cooked mine in the oven starting with high heat to sear and a lower heat to finish it off.  Loved the beautiful crust created by the mustard seeds.  Served this with green beans and mashed sweet potatoes for a fabulous comfort meal.  Thanks Kitz."
368594,135403,2007-05-13,5,"Hi Kit,
  This recipe is sooo yumm-o. We really liked it a lot. Thanx for sharing all your wonderful recipes. This is an EXCELLENT dish!!!!!
Hi Kit,
  We really enjoyed this recipe. It took about 1 1/2 to cook on the grill but it was worth it. Everybody enjoyed the pork loin. It really looked nice and yummy on the plate. I've added more fresh lemon juice, a little wine and it tasted fabulous. This is way more than 5 stars. Thank you for another successful dinner party. I didn't realize that i made this one before until i tried to make a comment on it and i wasn't allowed bec. i had already made a comment. TOO BAD, it was worth another comment. I guess,  the first time, i made it, i baked it but i think i like the grilled better...plus it keep my hubby busy 
barbequeing for awhile. So, once again thanks for sharing and for making another dinner a success. Way too good. Until next time, big hugs, Glen of Coolidge, Arizona."
283251,135403,2007-06-16,4,Yummy!! Nuff said. :)
149415,135403,2008-03-24,5,"This is soooo good! I actually used chicken breasts- and they turned out so juicy and yummy!! I marinaded about an hour and then grilled outside. The balsamic/mustard/honey combo is delish!! Thanks! (oh- the whole family ate it!)
3-24-08-- I used 3 lbs of tenderloin and grilled at about 400 degrees. It was taking awhile, so we butterflied them at the end of cooking. Total was about 40 minutes. Wonderful!!"
141293,135403,2008-07-29,5,"This was a fabulous dinner! I used 5 pork chops, and put it in the marinade for a week (not intentional, but ended up that way due to life) Anyway - grilled them up and served with a salad and brown butter, sage sweet potato gnocchi. This would be perfect with any side dish, summer through spring. Just  perfect flavor and balance."
286566,135403,2008-08-05,4,"Between the 4 diners this was rated between 3 and 5, so settlement point was 4. I used 2 pork fillets weighing about 330grams each which I cut in half and marinated for 24 hours (would love to turn the marinade into a sauce) and the DH cooked on the indoor ridged grill (no lid) for about 25 minutes total. Thank you Kittencal. Made for ZAAR Stars Tag Game."
52648,135403,2008-11-13,4,I loved the flavors in this marinade.  Very strong and very yummy.  I cooked my tenderloin in the oven instead of on the grill (due to the weather) and it came out great!
1017242,135403,2010-05-21,3,"I was a little disappointed that the marinade didn't contribute much to the meat. I ended up marinading it for two days, and while the very outside rim of the slices of pork were tasty, the inside tasted completely plain and dry. It would be nice to have some sort of sauce."
183199,135403,2018-06-27,4,I make this recipe often in the crockpot and the flavors get all the way through the meat. It is wonderful.
317696,152031,2007-03-17,4,I made these as instucted with the exception of using a BBQ instead of a frying pan.  They were very good but I may season them more next time.  I served them with a spinach salad and oven fries.
53932,152031,2011-06-30,4,"I grilled these too and they were quite tasty!   I added a little less cumin, thinking that it might be overpowering, but the amount indicated would not have been a bad thing."
424680,371586,2009-09-11,5,"I was ready to make this recipe the minute I'd tagged it, but had to wait a few days for a treat that I haven't had in a long, long time! You've got AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT RECIPE here for a very satisfying treat! Thanks for sharing it! Definitely a keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick A Chef]"
542692,371586,2010-02-16,5,"YUM-MO!!!!!!!!! WOW!! This was incredible! I made it for a SuperBowl party and doubled the recipe. Well, it wasn't all eaten then, but it was fought over by several people to take the leftovers home! SUPER EASY! They almost didn't get any of it after I sampled it!! Thank you, ChefJulieS!!!"
149363,140426,2006-10-28,5,"This is a terrific and simple cake to make. Just mix it all in one bowl and throw it in a pan!
My cake was finished much sooner than the directions stated, but it was fine as I was watching it.
Mine was cooked in 40 minutes.
The apples and cinnamon smell great while this is baking, and the top has a light crunchy texture that we loved.
No need to glaze the top, although I bet it would be good with a glaze too.
Thanks for another great recipe Elaine!"
281399,140426,2006-12-07,5,"Cant get any easier than this. Very moist cake mine was done in 50 minutes. Love the apples and nut combination, I used ground pecans. This recipe has ingredients that are always on hand in my pantry. Served it warm out of the oven topped with ice cream and caramel topping!  Great idea for potluck or picnics. Thanks ElaineAnn for sharing your mom's recipe."
341142,140426,2007-01-19,3,Not sure what I did wrong but I didn't get a nice crisp top. Also I   did not like the texture of the apples-they were still a little undercooked and hadn't absorbed much of the sugar or cinnamon. I guess I was expecting the apples to have more of an apple pie taste and texture. The next time I will 'stew' the apples first. I did not like this plain but it was nice with ice-cream and caramel sauce. Maybe I did something wrong.
2002334509,140426,2018-12-13,5,Very glad to find this recipe again. One of mom's go to's. She had the recipe in her head! I've made it a few times myself but had forgotten about it. So easy to put together!
1028001,343684,2008-12-15,0,"My (from germany), mother in law made this all the time ,without the bacon ,but added onions to the frying potatoes ,my husband likes it with bell peppers as well. You can add more potatoes to feed more people."
1019632,343684,2009-01-04,0,"I have not yet tried this recipe but, I spent 31/2 years in Germany, while I was in the military, and really loved the food there.  Thanks for an easy start to German cooking."
201581,343684,2009-04-07,5,"I made half the recipe for myself. I microwaved the potato for 2 minutes just to partially cook it. I added some onion to them when browning. This is a very easy recipe, but feels like I fussed just for ME! Thanks for a tasty recipe Bekah! Made and enjoyed for PAC Spring '09."
416985,343684,2011-04-26,5,"Loved this!! I took Elaineann's advice, and microwaved my potatoes. This is DELICIOUS. My DD looked the word up and it means ""country breakfast"" in German. It is truly a comforting ""country"" way to start the day. made for Spring PAC,2011."
17803,343684,2012-11-08,5,"I made this like a frittata, only on the stove top.   With a help of a lid and flipping it after 5 minutes on medium low heat.  I did not use the cheese at the end.  Made for Fall PAC 2012"
157425,355605,2009-03-16,4,My DH enjoyed this lettuce salad a lot but for me it was missing a bit of tang. My aunt used to make this with mayonnaise or salad dressing so I think that is the flavor I would have liked to have tasted. I used one large bunch of romaine lettuce that I rinsed well and wrapped in a towel to dry and did not need to add the milk. This is a quick side dish that would be nice with a bbq  or summer picnic. Thank  you for posting Jezski.
146742,355605,2014-04-25,0,"Went down memory lane with this one.  This is the only way my mom ever fixed lettuce when we were kids.  My grandma made it the same way.  Mom used mayo and leaf lettuce from her garden if she did&#039;nt have iceberg lettuce,  and grandma made it with cream.  I liked my grandma&#039;s the best."
2001179572,355605,2016-09-23,0,"Mayo is just not the real deal, totally different. Grew up with this during every holiday. Want more sweet sour taste, use plain white vingar, adjust with sugar. Never use Mayo, thats just not lettuce and cream"
107294,53079,2003-11-18,5,"I made this just as the recipe stated and it was very good and easy to make. My dad is an avid fisherman, and always keeps us in fish, so I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for posting."
54447,53079,2003-12-10,5,I'm on the Atkins diet and I have made this fish now (using catfish) about 4 times.  It is awesome!  I make it at least once a week.  It's absolutely superb.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Excellent recipe.  
115853,53079,2004-04-23,5,"I had my soon-to-be in-laws over for dinner for the first time tonight and made this recipe using talapia.  Now, keep in mind, I have NEVER made fish of any kind before (unless you count fish sticks...) so that gave me another reason to be nervous.  Well, no need - this was a hit!  I made it with lemon roasted zucchini (61129) and tomato salad (35624) and the end-result was a great-tasting, easy to make, healthy dinner.  Oh, and it looks so pretty on the plate with all that paprika!  Thank you so much :-)"
64203,53079,2004-06-29,5,"Tilapia is my favorite white fish, so I used that instead of the fish listed in the recipe. This recipe was easy, delicious and had a very  nice, light taste. I'm always looking for new fish recipes... this is one I'll make again! Thanks for sharing it!"
158971,53079,2004-08-21,4,"This is the first recipe I tried from this site.  It was G-O-O-D.  I cheated though and used the OTHER parmesan.  Next time I am using the real parmesan!

Mmmm!Mmmm!

Sonya"
184530,53079,2005-11-27,0,"I don't know what went wrong, but we were disappointed with this dish.  I made no changes to the recipe. The coating came out a bit soggy and we didn't think the Orange Roughy and the sauce complemented each other. I might try making it again some day and add a rating.  This first time around we'd give it a three. "
9869,53079,2006-03-08,5,"Great tasting fish dish, I used gurnard fillets.
Simple to make and enjoyed by all.Thanks for sharing."
206101,53079,2008-01-04,5,"Very good. Nice with boneless, skinless chicken breasts too!"
297557,53079,2008-05-29,5,Very good!  Instead of mixing paprika in with flour I sprinkled it on top...very pretty.  My fish only took 20 minutes to cook.  I will definitely make this dish again.
807941,53079,2008-08-11,4,"Very good recipe, but I ran a little short on the parmesan cheese coating and had to mix up a second batch.  I tried to coat both sides of the fish with the parmesan mix, was I supposed to coat only one side? Regardless, it tasted great."
804550,53079,2013-03-31,5,"The big wig food critics always say not to mix cheese with fish, but I think they are nuts! They are also missing out because this recipe was fabulous. I used Basa which I really have no idea what type of fish it is as the store I went to yesterday didn&#039;t have either kind of the suggested fish. The recipe was very easy and the parmesan cheese enhanced the delicate fish flavor. Thanks for posting! Made for Help A Photoless Recipe 3-2013."
98722,126851,2007-06-14,3,"This is a bit different to what one might expect an apple casserole to taste like; it's not overly sweet and is very much a dinner dish.  I thought it was a little on the mild side, so I'll probably tweak the spices if I make this again (or maybe even add some cheddar cheese!).  However, the boyfriend liked it very much and said it was how apples at dinner should taste.  I didn't peel my apples (more fiber), but the peels softened while baking and were no problem.  Thanks for posting!"
58038,37073,2003-08-27,4,These look just like french fries and are very easy to make.  A lot of options with the seasoning too.  2 Tbsp of margarine doesn't sound like enough but it is plenty.  2 yo DS loved these french fries and gobbled them up.  Thanks for the recipe.
169969,37073,2005-11-15,5,Everyone enjoyed these and I loved that they were so easy to clean up after than fried potatoes. I will make my fries like this more often. Thanks Dancer!
197023,37073,2005-12-03,5,"A fabulous low calorie, low fat way of enjoying “fried” chips!  Very easy to make, very clear instructions, very quick and together with ellie_’s Spinach With Sesame Seed Recipe #138862, they made a totally delicious lunch.  The weather had turned suddenly much cooler today, and I felt like some sort of comfort food, so I made just a quarter portion, which in step 9 I sprinkled with dried oregano and sage.  Thanks Dancer^ for sharing this recipe."
157136,37073,2010-04-05,4,"These were good.  We used oregano and I didn't like that flavor, my husband and boys did though.  I think next time I will add a little salt instead.  Thanks for sharing."
442988,280918,2008-02-08,5,"Thanks so much for mentioning this!  I don't know why I never thought of it, but I didn't -- and this was SO much easier and neater than frying it in a pan.  It wasn't just that I could avoid the splatter -- it's that I could do other things while the bacon was cooking.  Thanks so very much for posting this!"
17803,280918,2008-02-12,0,"I have the same recipe baked at a lower temp,  Recipe #187790"
312206,218711,2008-02-20,0,"WHat a wonderful cook you are!  This had me salivating just reading it.  And what a thoughtful son!  He will be very glad he has these later in life, not just at college.  How could anybody refer to a dish like this as 'icky'?  It is as delicious as it sounds."
336058,218711,2007-11-18,4,"I was looking for something quick and easy to do with the kale, instead of salad.  This was great!  I didn't really measure anything, except using most of the 2 leeks.  I had enough kale to stuff my large saucepan.  I made the bacon in the micro and chopped and added it in (using 5 slices).  Thanks!"
440158,218711,2007-03-26,4,"Did this over the weekend. I do any greens, whether Kale, spinach, or whatever this way. My fry pan runneth over, lol, but the stuff cooks down a whole lot. Its quick, easy, and very tasty. I don't usually have leeks,so I used green onions. Sometimes I chop up regular onion and use it instead."
47907,90483,2005-01-06,5,I found this recipe on the internet several years ago and have made it many times since.  I make it exactly as posted.  I have also used butternut squash.   It is very good with baked ham or turkey at your holiday meals.  Thank you for posting this keeper recipe!
121185,95608,2005-04-03,4,"This was quite tastey - much more like a soufle than a dutch baby.  It doesn't really cook up like a big cloud and then fall in the center like a traditional dutch baby does - but overall, yummy..."
407132,95608,2006-12-14,5,This is an wonderful recipe! I felt like I was eating at a BandB. I substituted brown sugar and it is equally as good if not better than powedered sugar!
354675,95608,2007-09-23,5,Aren't these so yummy!?  I actually just saute the apples in the butter on the stove top with the cin-sugar and then whisk the batter in a bowl (too lazy for a blender) and pour over the apples and then into the oven for 20.  Anyway same basic idea and I love the flavor combo.  I dust it with powdered sugar just before serving and my kiddos gobble it up.  Thanks for posting!
185926,95608,2009-11-26,5,"Easy, delicious and fast.  We loved it for breakfast.  I, too sauted the apples, butter, sugar and cinnamon, then added the batter to the pan and put into the oven for about 15 minutes.  Yummy.  I did not miss salt in this dish."
490843,95608,2009-12-27,5,"Just a great meal for a cold weekend night.  I did the same as other reviewers.  Cooked apples in cast iron skillet with butter, apples, cinnamon and sugar then pored batter over them.  Absolutely grand quick supper!"
497847,95608,2012-02-19,5,"This is a nice recipe. I did things a little differently. I use cast iron skillet.  Melt the butter on the stovetop.  Add cinnamon, sugar and a pinch of nutmeg.  Core apples using corer and slice each piece in 1/2 again into the skillet.  Saute for a bit...turning the slices over. Then I add a bit of spiced rum (could use another liquor or skip it if for small children)  and ignite it.  Add the blender batter PLUS a pinch of salt, a little vanilla and bake.  My family loves it!  So easy and never fails to impress."
2002043214,95608,2018-03-11,5,"Turned out awesome, even my picky toddler loved it. Will make again! Very fast and easy, a bonus!"
2002131819,95608,2018-04-27,5,"I love how it turned out! man it was very good, I know that when my landscape design company was here doing my lawn they asked me what i was cooking haha!"
424680,334434,2010-04-16,5,"It is an exceptionally easy & inexpensive way to have a good-size chicken breast serve two ~ The breasts I get are usually 7 or 8 ounces each! I did make 1 small addition to this recipe, in that I seasoned it with a bit of lemon pepper! Served over brown rice, & we had a wonderfully satisfying meal! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick A Chef Event]"
907661,334434,2010-08-04,5,Very easy and very good. I did change a little bit. I added a bit of agave nectar to give the dish a sweetish taste. This might not have been necessary but I didn't have the full 1 cup of fresh basil. I also added a touch of cayenne pepper for a bit of spice!
2001945750,334434,2018-01-21,1,"Completely bland even using the fresh basil. Not even salt or pepper in the recipe. Nothing special in this recipe except basic methodology for a stir fry, and that is helpful. I added honey and curry, which makes anything taste good, so it did have flavor in the end."
166642,247191,2007-11-21,5,This was a wonderful alternative to bagged salad and less expensive! I made it exactly as stated. Congrats on your football win!
4470,247191,2009-06-09,5,"What a great money saver this is - Total cost for 3 different lettuce $2.30 Double the size of a $4.00 bag of prepared.  I will store it in a ""Green"" bag - They really work and this will keeps for well over a week- maybe even two weeks"
590134,265513,2009-10-25,5,Great Recipe!!! Thanks
49304,90902,2004-05-14,5,"Delicious, even though I had trouble with the apples not cooking right, I used Cameo apples as this is what I had on hand. DH Loved it. I belive that you could cut the apples up and it would work fine. I am going to buy some Macintosh apples and make it again. We love apples and this is another great way to fix them."
115178,90902,2004-05-15,0,"I didnt care for this one too much. Maybe I overbaked it, but it came out tasting and had a texture of scrambled eggs. I thought perhaps it needed to be baked in a waterbath. Anyways I would like to thank you for the recipe:)"
16334,90902,2006-05-31,5,"This recipe is gorgeous! It even worked when I had to use gluten-free flour and soy milk.  I ended up slicing all the apples like in an apple pie, added a few teaspoons of vanilla in the milk mix, and topped it with a desicated coconut, cinammon and sugar sprinkle.  It was perfect for the cold weather and EVERYONE loved it! THANKS!!!"
500549,90902,2011-10-09,4,"Let me preface this by saying I do not understand the ""custard cooked in apples"" thing - really, it's the other way around - apples cooked in custard.  That being said, I give it 3.5 or 4 stars as written, but 5 stars with the following adjustments:<br/>-I added some sugar (about a Tablespoon, rounded) to the custard mixture.  It seemed to me this part should be sweet for a dessert.<br/>-I added a Tablespoon (I could see also using a teaspoon or two) of vanilla to the custard.<br/>-I stuffed the insides of the apples with raisins (I could see nuts too, or a combination - the hollowed apples just seemed to call out for something inside).  I could also see just slicing the apples as one reviewer did; I will try it that way next time.<br/><br/>Also, next time I will double the custard part because it seemed like mainly a lot of apple with a little custard around them.  My family likes custard & it wouldve been really nice if there was even more, so I will make more with it next time.<br/><br/>I used a water bath with this.  I'm not sure it was necessary, but I googles it & the consensus seemed to be to use a water bath for successful custard making so I did.  I cannot comment on how it would've been without it.<br/><br/>Oh, I also used brown sugar since the recipe didn't specify and brown sugar just sounded better to me.  I'm sure white sugar would be good too.<br/><br/>Thanks! :)"
590105,232396,2008-03-21,4,"My 11yo son liked this and I thought it was okay, but we agreed we thought it would be better with some kind of Asian-y sauce. (I like a burger with lots of stuff on it.) So I looked around and found Recipe #57992 which has a Thai-style sauce. Now, those two together with some tomato was *really* good! I made the burgers with ground turkey and served them with Recipe #288002. Made for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #14."
196038,178075,2006-08-03,4,"Rhonda......I fixed the fried veggies using this recipe for the batter for a part of last nights dinner. We liked them alot, but I think I'll try adding some spices of various kinds in the next batches.  I think Tobasco sauce might even be good. Onion powder, garlic powder, Italian seasoning all sound good to me and could be varied according to the remainder of the meal. This is the first time I have fried veggies, and it won't be the last.  Thank you!"
306709,178075,2006-11-27,5,"Just made this, and it was GREAT! Really light tempura-type batter. I used it for mushrooms and even dipped some fresh broccoli and fried it! We LOVED it! I'd recommend it to anyone! Thanks Rhonda! My Texan husband loves it!"
431115,178075,2007-03-21,4,"We liked this recipe. I substituted milk with plain yogurt and added spices. I used sliced potatoes and eggplant. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Rhonda."
433225,178075,2007-11-07,3,"I didn't get a crisp light batter, rather a thick doughy batter that never got crisp. Tasted a little ""Pancakey"". After adding Garlic Oregano, and more salt, the taste was ok, just not crispy. Fried it more, but not there."

37449,73226,2004-01-03,5,"Ooh, this was so good! I used frozen apple slices and chopped the walnuts in the food processor. I did not put on a top crust, but baked as directed. I just spread the topping on the apples and it turned out real nice! YUM! Thanks Kimke!"
80353,73226,2004-01-17,5,"This was a delicious pie - the sweetness and spices just right, imo.  I did add 1/2 cup of walnuts to the streusel topping, only because we all love walnuts and always seem to want more.  Thanks."
91392,73226,2005-10-13,5,"Long to cook, but what a pretty pie when it was done.  I used oatmeal instead of the nuts.  Great for when you have one roll of pie crust in the fridge but not two!"
201614,73226,2009-02-10,5,best apple pie ive ever eaten !
165941,115537,2005-04-11,5,"This is a delicious bread! I expected a same old same old, but it was tasty and easy. I wish that I hadn't made the three strands so thin and long, the finished pieces weren't very big. I didn't glaze it either, but the crust was almost flaky! Thank you so much! "
28346,115537,2005-04-14,4,"A tasty loaf, and quite easy to prepare.  It baked up beautifully and I wish I could have taken a picture to post when I took it from the oven shiny and golden brown.  The only addition I made was to sprinkle some poppy seeds on top before baking.  I already have a request to make it again this weekend."
125325,115537,2006-03-16,4,"This was very tasty with nice texture. It came together very easily. Will definitely make this again...plus of course, it's very pretty :) Thanks!"
464204,115537,2007-06-30,5,"This bread looks so pretty, and it tastes delicious!"
467583,115537,2009-03-18,5,"I picked out this recipe to use up a leftover egg yolk in my fridge, and I was pleasantly surprised! This is by far better than any sourdough or french bread that I have had or made. This almost sweet bread is good to snack on or to serve with butter during a meal. It's addictive!"
515278,115537,2014-02-25,5,Easy to work with and tasted great!
588412,115537,2017-04-22,5,"I like this a lot. I used olive oil in place of butter otherwise I followed the recipe (I didn't glaze it either). Tastes very good, makes great toast and is excellent for grilled cheese sandwiches, I made a 5 strand braid."
296809,376009,2010-01-07,5,"Made for your Wk 13 Football Pool win, I really liked this tasty dressing. While Icelanders eat their salad ""naked"", I prefer them dressed & make my own dressing. I do not care for black beans & a good avocado is fairly rare here, so I used it on a taco salad made w/seasoned grd beef, shredded cheese & all the salad fixins in my fridge. It was delicious & I think would be esp good w/a grilled chicken salad for summer fare. Thx for this recipe & CONGRATS on your FP win. :-)"
37449,376009,2010-04-07,5,I really enjoyed this dressing over a romaine lettuce salad. I used a Jack Daniels bbq sauce and it was just right. Thanks! Made for 123 Hit Wonders game.
126440,376009,2014-09-06,5,"Made half a cup for sauce on a Southwestern Chicken flatbread.  Used Recipe #71609 for the Black Bean hummus, with homemade flatbread.  Will love using the leftovers."
12657,19729,2002-03-06,2,"I'm sorry, but this was just so-so. Scaling down to 1 serving, I used only 1 teaspoon of butter, but it still turned out way too greasy. Also, the taste of the soy sauce was very overpowering, and I couldn't really taste any of the other seasonings. I used fresh peas, and added some oregano as well. The rice took on a nice brown colour while sauteing, and I probably should have skipped the soy sauce altogether."
580861,19729,2007-11-21,5,"Thanks Mona,we really like this rice.I used only 1 T soy sauce and added a little cajun seasoning as I often do.Very easy and good!"
166642,129656,2007-03-28,5,"Delicious! Made this for a get-together I had with some friends and it was a hit. I didn't have any left to take home. I served it with toasted bagel rounds. Thanks for sharing, Kathy!"
1052065,361081,2009-11-13,5,"This was great. I used chicken breasts because I don't like thighs. The oregano and parsley  with the sauteed onions added great flavor. I will make this again.
I made this for My-3-Chefs Nov 2009."
537937,341764,2008-12-06,3,"I had high expectations for this as I am an oatmeal freak.  But, after giving the mixture a whirl with my hand-held braun, I still didn't care for the consistency of the drink.  I kept thinking I needed to warm it up to make it taste better.  Not saying the taste was bad, just not what I wanted in a smoothie.  I have in the past added just a touch of oatmeal to other smoothie recipes I've made, but where it wasn't the main ingredient.   This just wasn't right for me.  I'm glad I gave it a go for NewKids on the Block Tag Game!~"
345569,218648,2008-03-04,4,"These were gone within 48 hours, which must mean they're good because there were only two or three people eating them!  We have a similar recipe in my family, only ours is chocolate instead of peanut butter... this went over well, though.  VERY peanut buttery -- maybe because I hate measuring out gooey things like peanut butter, so I guesstimated, and I may have put in too much.  I couldn't find a 12-oz box of corn flakes, so I used 8 cups.  I got twenty good-sized cookies.  Thanks for posting!"
62494,44415,2003-04-03,3,"the recipe looked delicious but it had a few flaws in my opinion.  I used regular bagged wheat bread and maybe I should have used different, I don't know.  It was very ""bready"" tasting.  The sauce was excellent, i could almost eat  just that with a spoon.  the french toast took a lot longer to cook than the specified time since all the bread was just piled upon each other. I wasn't too crazy about it though and with that many calories maybe that's a good thing.  I made it for my husband though and he liked it, so maybe it's just me."
42367,44415,2004-12-25,5,"I originally found this recipe on the web site for Florida Natural Orange juice.  I have continually used this recipe for special occasions.  I have used just plain white bread, french bread and even homemade bread with excellent results.  I have never tried wheat bread in this recipe.  This recipe is very easy to make and bake."
229619,44415,2006-02-12,4,Made this for our Sunday morning breakfast.  I ended up making 1 1/2 times the amount of egg/milk/orange juice mixture for 8 slices of bread.  It seemed a little dry with just the amount listed.  It baked up yummy tho.  I think I should have cooked the orange syrup a little longer because it never got very thick.  More like an orange butter.  Loved the flavor tho.  I have some of the syrup left and I'm trying to think what I can bake to pour it over for a dessert later!
133174,44415,2006-07-24,5,"This rating is for the French toast only as I did not make the orange syrup.  I made the French toast by decreasing the recipe to serve 2.  I made a couple of substituations; i.e., egg substitute for the eggs and Splenda for the sugar. The bread used was homemade French bread.  Possibly due to the substituations, it did not brown but was declicious.  DH says he would like for me to make it again.   "
296809,44415,2006-10-15,4,"I halved the recipe for 2 of us, used wheat sandwich bread & debated the orange syrup part of the recipe while the French toast chilled. I wanted to be faithful to the recipe & knew I was going to photograph it, but also felt (for us at least) the syrup would be overkill. I finally opted not to make it. The toast puffed up some & browned nicely in the exact cooking time specified. What I like best about this dish is what made my choice a good one. It is lightly sweet, not overpoweringly sweet as many of its genre are. I served it w/bacon & tasted it several ways, i.e. plain (good), w/maple syrup (good), lightly buttered (very good), lightly buttered & dusted w/powdered sugar (Special!). The orange flavour was just right & the nutmeg a nice addition. I do not feel the pecans added anything except to the presentation. This is a lovely company-worthy dish, easy to fix & tastes great. Thx for sharing it w/us."
767712,44415,2008-07-05,4,"This toast was really good!  I wanted to do something different with the sauce though, so I added a bit more butter and some maple syrup.  OMG!!!! The result was mouth watering, makes-your-cheeks-hurt, deliciousness!"
641300,44415,2009-11-30,4,"I made this for my visiting parents for a nice brunch. I used two types of bread, one a whole-grain white and the other a pre-sliced French sandwich bread.  I preferred the French bread as it browned more and crisped up a bit more than the white bread.  The orange syrup was divine. Don't expect a thick syrup, though, it is pretty thin in consistency but the flavor is great.  I will make this again using all French bread and will add a bit more nutmeg to give it a boost. Thanks for a very nice recipe!"
227978,44415,2018-08-14,5,"The orange syrup is positively divine in this recipe. The crust on my baked French Toast was a little crusty and hard, so I think next time I'll pay more attention to making sure each piece is fully covered in the milky egg mixture before baking. But it was OK once the syrup was drizzled on top. It was a really delicious breakfast. Thanks, PanNan. Made for Susie's World Tour 2018 (Cajun/Creole)."
128473,44415,2018-08-31,5,"Wow, 5 stars for this tasty recipe. I loved it. I left the french toast to sit in the fridge for about 3 hours. It puffed up beautifully. This was so wonderful with the delicious orange syrup. What a lovely treat. That I know I will enjoy often. Thanks for sharing Nan. Made for Susie's World Tour - Cajun/Creole"
166642,460421,2011-12-16,5,This is a great snack or appetizer! It is so simple to put together and my family and guests really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing.
1620171,290218,2012-06-30,5,"Made for my 3 chefs June 2012. I served this with Recipe #142011 and some gremolata and this all went together amazingly. I lost track of how long I left the potatos in the oven, but they came out smelling and tasting great.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for sharing, this was a real pleasure. Also, didn't have tomato sauce so used approx half a cup of tomato paste for this."
268644,146164,2007-11-18,5,this is so delicious!  thanks for posting!
133174,189930,2007-01-07,5,Wonderful and oh so easy.  The hardest part is knowing what topping to use.  I filled these with recipe #174446 by Rita L and then dusted lightly with powdered sugar.  They made a great brunch this morning.  The pan I used was my 10 inch omelet pan which is non-stick.  These only required a small amount of butter in the warmed skillet and a warmed skillet is a must for proper cooking.
351811,189930,2007-02-15,5,Made for an extra special Valentines Breakfast! Outstanding recipe. I made Rita's Recipe #174446 for the filling. What a combination. This is a keeper recipe... thanks for sharing! ~V
89831,189930,2007-03-16,5,"These fryed up so light, I also added in a teaspoon of vanilla and stuffed them with blueberry filling and topped with whipped cream, we enjoyed this, thanks Cheesehead!...Kitten:)"
165623,189930,2007-05-14,5,"I am eating these as I write this review ... and I am moaning ... so good. The only change I made was to sub flax seed oil for vegetable oil. I filled with a small amount of strawberry jam, cool whip and fresh blueberries. Props to your grandma for a great recipe!!
Update: I also made these with soy milk instead of reg and just as good, a bit thicker!"
316717,189930,2007-05-28,5,this was so easy and fast to whip up. thank you for sharing! =)
772912,189930,2008-11-19,5,This is a keeper! I made these last night for dinner. My bf has never had 'crepes' before and he GOBBLED them up. I also added a splash of vanilla and filled them with homemade raspberry syrup. I can't wait to try these again with different fillings.
1235236,189930,2014-02-22,5,This is also a recipe that my Czech grandmother made for her many grandchildren. We called them &quot;egg pancakes&quot; as kids.  My grandfather was a beekeeper and we always had fresh honey and butter on top.  I also added 1tsp vanilla. Made these for my kids this morning. Delicious!
1803321313,189930,2014-11-09,5,"Amazing crepe recipe, better than my regular one.  These crepes taste great, and they come out  perfectly.  Use abundant butter on the pan for extra yumminess."
2621775,189930,2014-12-29,3,"As being raised by a german mother, Mom would make these for us kids and spread jelly jam or preserves in it then roll it up, and sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the top or powdered sugar or make powdered cinnamon sugar which were the best to me... MMMM YUM"
1803633920,189930,2015-01-09,5,I have no clue how to cook and on my first try these came out almost perfect!! delicious easy recipe with no weird ingredients.
114243,189930,2015-02-22,5,These turned out amazing and delicious! I filled them with strawberry filling I made from frozen strawberries cooked down with sugar and cornstarch added to make it sweet and thickened; then I topped them with some sour cream mixed with a bit of sugar and vanilla to taste. So much yum going on here!!
2000073938,189930,2015-06-08,5,"amazing, turned out better then I imagined! I topped then off with strawberry&#039;s and powdered sugar, it tasted amazing!"
2001102678,189930,2017-04-29,5,Cheesehead they're wonderful must try
4470,382166,2009-11-06,5,Wonderful tasty recipe - we really enjoyed it.  It is such an easy recipe that adds to the flavor of the asparagus  Will definitely make this again
797028,382166,2009-11-29,5,This was fantastic! I would rate this 10 stars if I could. I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. There were leftovers which I heated in the microwave tonight and it was still excellent. I added sliced almonds as a garnish. Thanks muncheechee for posting. This is a keeper.
158086,382166,2010-07-26,5,"This is worth 10 stars...,we love loved it..."
855206,317975,2008-08-15,5,Awesome!
1320681,317975,2009-08-16,5,"This is really good.  The notes provided suggest serving over rice as a main dish.  I used this recipe to recreate a similar dish I had in an Italian restaurant recently. 

 I increased the garlic, and fresh ground pepper and added a 12 ounce jar of roasted red pepper chopped.  Right before serving, I added one package cooked ravioli.  Sprinkled with parmesan and some shredded four cheese Italian mix.   I was very happy with the results.  Husband really enjoyed as well.  Will definetly make again.  Thanks for the great recipe."
111381,317975,2010-01-29,5,Delicious! Definitely will be made again and I think the idea of adding a bit of parmesan sounds great. Thanks for such a simple way to prepare asparagus.
789516,317975,2010-05-10,5,"great combination of flavours, will be making this again."
2000392027,317975,2015-08-17,5,This was super tasty. I ended up cooking the asparagus for like 4-5 extra minutes to soften it up just a little more. Really wonderful flavor- very balanced!
36079,206585,2007-02-04,4,I added some cocoa to this mix (two tablespoons) and came up with a delicious chocolate cheesecake that was very easy to prepare.  Note however that it's two 8oz packages of cream cheese (for a total of 16oz) not two 16oz packages.
469903,206585,2008-04-07,3,"This didn't quite work out for me...  I used lite cream cheese, made my own graham cracker crust and followed directions as noted being careful not to overmix - it seemed pretty thick to me but I don't make cheesecake often so I just put it in the oven. Oh, and I swirled some raspberry jam on the top. After 40 minutes it didn't appear much different, so I turned the heat up to 350 and baked for another 5-7 minutes until it was brown on just the very outer edges - it never did appear jiggly so I couldn't use that as a gauge. Waited overnight to try and it was  just ok today. Made for PAC Spring 2008."
11119,31209,2002-06-26,4,"This was my first attempt at both cooking and eating brussel sprouts.  They were not as much like cabbage as I thought they would be, cabbage is my fav vege.  Anyway, the recipe went down well with hubby.  Thanks!"
35965,31209,2002-08-23,4,"I made these for dinner a couple nights ago with brussel sprouts from my garden.  Both of my daughters (who love garlic) wouldn't even try them.  :-((  Oh well, their loss.  My husband loved them and wants me to make them again.  I thought they were a nice change of pace, but probably won't make them very often.  An observation my husband made (and I agree) is that the garlic butter really tends to reduce the ""strong flavor"" natural to brussel sprouts.  I'll have to try these out on our son and his fiancée the next time they come for dinner.  Our son, like both his parents, loves brussel sprouts.  Thanks for sharing Julesong."
4470,31209,2007-09-24,5,Great sprout recipe.Instead of pouring the garlic butter over the steamed sprouts I added them to the pan and sauteed them for 3 minutes - Wonderful flavor.  Thanks Julesong for posting this tasty recipe
29782,31209,2007-10-02,4,Enjoyed this recipe :) Love the butter and garlic flavor.
53932,31209,2007-11-17,4,What's not to like with all that garlic and butter?  I also put the brussels sprouts in the pan along with the melted butter and garlic and lightly sauteed.
643224,31209,2007-11-25,4,"My husband convinced me that I didn't hate brussels sprouts, I just had them done poorly....I did this recipe and we are all converts now! :)"
369715,31209,2008-03-22,4,"This was good and easy to make. I used a bag of SteamFresh brussel sprouts and followed the rest of the ingredients as written. Once the brussel sprouts were steamed I added them to the butter/garlic mixture and cooked them on the stove for about five minutes, stirring frequently. Nice easy side dish."
64667,262714,2008-06-04,5,"Nice little supper for a busy day!   Added mushrooms and sliced black olives.    Used spaghetti sauce (it's what I had on hand!) and added extra herbs (basil, oregano, garlic powder).    Could've used more cheese, and next time I'd rather have some mozzarella in there, too.    Great way to use up the extra buns left from DS's graduation party!   Went over very well with the kids--they said I should add it to my KEEPER binder!    *My Three Chefs 08 - Top That Pizza!*"
55128,262714,2009-03-27,4,Very yummy and so easy. We had it with a few chips which made  it  a quick easy dinner.  However my kids wouldn't eat it. :(  If not for them I would make it over & over again.
1802849661,262714,2015-12-15,4,"Such a great, easy weeknight meal! I served them with some chips and salad and they went down a storm! Can&#039;t get over how easy they were to make! And utterly delicious! :)"
2001094025,262714,2016-10-17,5,"My mom always made these when i was a kid, i still make them. Its a fav at our house. We add almost a half of can of grated spam to the meat, at the end of browning, and brown with it. Its sounds strange lol but it gives it an added saltiness thats really really good."
2001444473,262714,2017-03-19,0,"I put everything that comes on pizza in my mixture and put it on buns, then wrap it up in foil, bake at 350 for about 20mins (really messy but GOOD)"
39949,26931,2003-10-21,5,"Made this recipe exactly as directed (right down to the Jack Daniels mustard with horseradish) and it was just wonderful!  Served it as a side at our Autumn party, and it was gone in no time.  Towards serving time, I did add a bit more worchestershire, though, and I thought it was great.  Wonderful, unusual beans that I'll make often - thanks, Denise! "
80980,26931,2007-05-08,4,Served these tonight with grilled hot dogs. Loved the different twist these ingredients added to a can of baked beans. I didn't have the Jack Daniels mustard - but I did add about 1/4 tsp of creamy horseradish with the prepared mustard.  And I had to substitute peach preserves for the apricot as that's what I had on hand. This beats warmed up canned beans any day.  Thank-you for sharing!
56003,406699,2010-08-12,0,"This was one of the best apple crisps I've had in years.  I don't know if it was the cinnamon sugar or the topping.  I did have to cheat on the topping a little bit.  I didn't have enough brown sugar (those sugar theives are at it again!), so I used white sugar and then some molasses.  Yum!  Thnx for sharing your recipe, PaNik.  Made for PAC Spring 2010.

734372,263371,2008-01-23,5,Love this recipe . . . it's easy and tasty.  Rave reviews.  There's a lot of cinnamon in this recipe - even if you like cinnamon!  I liked putting a little bit of cardamom in the batter as well.
390731,263371,2008-08-01,5,"Great recipe, just what I was looking for. I gorged on this, but it was worth the extra workout to be able to do it! Thanks!"
482933,263371,2009-07-16,5,"Um um still smacking my lips--delish!     DH and I both come from a Swedish background so definitely enjoyed this!  (Had it with a Mexican meal, so it was an interesting meal.)  The cinnamon was spot on but our family loves cinnamon. I had cardamon buy it in bulk in pods and was rushing around so truly just plain forgot to get it out of the basement freezer and pound one pod up, but it would be great in this and will add it the next time I make it, and Katzen there will be a next time.  Served ours with ice cream.  Halved the recipe so made them in ramekins-love ramekins for the two of us.  This recipe would easily serve 8 people, I split the recipe in half and put them into 4 ramekin dishes. Used Macintosh apples with  the minimum amount of sugar.  Thanks you for sharing a great recipe.  Made for Veggie Swap in July."
311003,263371,2009-07-30,5,"What a fantastic recipe!  It was so easy to put together, no rolling of dough, etc.  We absolutely loved it; the ingredient amounts were perfect and the crust really is unique, with a wonderful texture and taste.

178427,263371,2009-10-23,4,This is a good pie. The only problem I had was how to store the leftover pie. I put plastic wrap on it and put it in the fridge. When I took it out for dessert the next day the topping was all gooey. It really ruined that great first day experience.
383346,263371,2009-10-25,5,I used spartan apples.  I reduced the sugar to around 3/4 cup.  It's enough.  I used the cardamom.  Thanks Katzen :)  Made for Holiday tag
678366,263371,2009-11-12,5,I loved this! The cardamon was the reason I tried it and it was great in this pie! Added some lemon rind and reduced the sugar.
424680,263371,2010-02-18,5,"Made this GREAT TASTING PIE almost a week ago & forgot to post a review! I used 4 large Granny Smith apples, & took a tip from littlemafis & added lemon zest, then followed the recipe on down! There were 4 of us here the day I made it in the morning, & it was all gone by 6:30pm! Great pie, great recipe, great keeper ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Stars tag]"
1248794,263371,2010-02-22,5,"I love cardamom and when I saw this I knew I had to try it.  This is so simple to make and it is such a comforting dessert.  I ate more than I should have, but Im not complaining!  Deelicious!!"
573325,263371,2010-03-04,5,"Another winner brought to us all by Kat! :)
Seriously, this is one of the easiest and most delish apple pies Ive ever tried! It has a lovely cakey crust and melt in your mouth apple slices for the filling. YUM!
I used only 3 apples, cause that looked like plenty to me and reduced both butter and sugar due to personal preferences. Used only 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter, which worked out perfectly. Served it with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and everyone was licking their lips. :)
THANK YOU so much for sharing this superb recipe with us, Kat!
Made and reviewed for Veggie Swap #20 March 2010."
593927,263371,2010-04-19,5,"This smells delicious while baking and tastes really good. I made it gluten free by using a rice flour mix (white rice flour & half the amount of tapioca starch, no gum) I used granny smith apples, dark brown sugar on top of the apples and white sugar in the crust, I reduced both by about half along with the butter like another reviewer. Doing that made the batter unable to be poured, but I spooned it on top and it worked out fine. I chose just to use cinnamon as I felt, though I love cardamom, I wouldn't in this. I would make this again and would like to try with more butter than I did but keep the sugar at about half. Made for Sweet Traditions Tag Game - Spring 2010."
1708738,263371,2010-11-07,5,I know this recipe.  It's awesome.  It was posted by Donna in <br/>vegetarian_group on Yahoo<br/>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vegetarian_group/
1933166,263371,2011-06-16,1,"Too sweet, apples turned to mush and the topping was rock hard.<br/>No one cared for it"
498271,503314,2013-07-21,5,"Absolutely delicious!  Easy to make; I was generous with the pepper which was perfect with the sweetness of the ricotta and the brightness of the lemon.  Really loved this - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT9, The Apron String Travelers"
114027,503314,2013-09-04,5,Really liked the lemon and black pepper flavors in this. I&#039;ll be making this for the next pot luck I go to! Made for ZWT9 the Hot Pink Panthers.
266635,503314,2014-03-06,5,"Delish!  Loved all the flavors and I added extra pepper as well.  Can&#039;t wait to serve this for Company. : )  Made for Best of 2013 Cookbook tag, March, 2014."
296809,503314,2014-12-03,5,Made as written for the Sweet December event. This is a tasty &amp; easy-fix. I do think it can be served hot or cold. I added extra garlic &amp; chose a different presentation. I served it w/flatbread made for another game &amp; glazed ham (also made for the Sweet December event). I will prob serve it cold or reduce the amt of lemon juice next time as it tended to separate from the mixture when heated. Thx for sharing this delicious recipe w/us.
37636,503314,2014-12-29,5,"We love baked ricotta and this was no exception. The lemon especially highlighted the dip, especially when I serve it with hot peperoncini. Very simple and quick to make as well. Thanks for sharing. ~s"
1557903,343019,2010-02-20,5,"My 6 yr old son had never had a cookie before today due to severe allergies. Now that he can eat wheat I've been looking for a recipe he'd enjoy that would be butter/margarine, nut, chocolate and egg free. These were a BIG BIG hit!!! They were very easy and quick to make. Very unhealthy, but I think that's the point of a cookie!  A new family recipe for sure."
220166,219479,2007-04-26,4,The flavor of this drink was out of this world!  But it was really thick.  I think next time I will add another ounce of pineapple juice or kick it up a little and add an ounce of coconut rum.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!
423778,258672,2007-10-24,5,Thanks for the posting! Needed some allspice for a syrup recipe and it was here fast and easy. Thank you!
363962,258672,2007-12-16,5,"Thank you Mimi in Maine, for posting this recipe, it really came in handy."
422893,258672,2008-06-27,5,A great recipe to have on hand when you've run out of store-bought. I used this for ZWT 4 - Spice it Up Africa challenge.
130447,258672,2008-10-29,5,Lifesaver!  Thank you.
360030,258672,2008-11-22,5,I had guests for dinner and I really thought I had some and didn't bother buying any....oops.  Thanks for posting!  This was a lifesaver.
28177,258672,2009-07-11,5,"This was excellent!  I don't normally stock allspice because it loses it's flavor long before I have time to use it up.  I was thrilled to find this recipe when I needed allspice for a cake.  I also appreciate that it doesn't make a huge quantity.  I used the 1/2 teaspoons of everything & the mix was perfect.  Thanks for sharing, Mimi!  :)"
454149,258672,2009-07-31,5,Great recipe to have if you don't have allspice on hand. Thanks.
857489,258672,2009-10-17,5,This came in so handy for me! I needed 1/4 teaspoon of allspice for Pasta Jambalaya Recipe# 23864 and it worked great. I used equal amounts of all three spices. Thank you!
862059,258672,2009-10-20,5,This was very good! I used 1/2 tsp of each ingredient! I used this to make gingerbread cookies and it worked perfectly! Thanks!
160977,258672,2009-12-06,5,"At first I was afraid that the cloves would be too dominant but decided to be brave and use equal parts of all three spices. Must say I was glad I did. Made a plain white cake and added the mix. It smelled heavenly and was very nice indeed, just the taste of allspice. I like the fact that it makes a small amount, perfect to just mix together when a recipe calls for allspice. Thanks for posting. Made for P-A-R-T-Y holiday tag December 2009"
560491,258672,2010-02-17,5,This was perfect!  Needed some for recipe#382313 and never thought to check if I had any.  Was going to just leave it out but thought I would do a little search first and here it is.  Came in very handy; I only needed 1/4 tsp so cut it in half.  I must say I went the scardy-cat way and used the less cloves recipe.  Next time I will try equal parts. Thanks for posting!
142559,258672,2011-04-24,5,PERFECT!!!  Just what I was looking for!  I used 1 tsp of each and placed in a jar for the next time I am hunting for allspice :)
1953047,258672,2011-07-10,5,"Was a bit hesitant at first but to lazy to drive to the store for just allspice.<br/>Needed it for Our Lone Star Steak & Potato Dinner.<br/> I gotta give you Kudos Turned out ""perfect"".<br/>Thanks for the great idea!!!"
546010,258672,2011-11-03,5,"Thanks! Perfect when a recipe calls for a small amount, or not!"
511112,258672,2012-02-07,0,Fantastic!  It seemed I had every other spice but Allspice.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It tasted wonderful in my Apple Coffee Cake.
2324285,258672,2012-10-21,5,"Awesome!  I love being able to make my own spice blends to save shelf space and money, and this is a near-perfect substitute.  Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2000370571,258672,2015-07-29,0,"Thanks for the Allspice sub.  I had almost every spice on earth except that one.  It smelled and tasted just the same, although my husband said he could detect the cloves with his nose....so maybe a little hold off on the cloves for some may be in order....otherwise it&#039;s a great sub. - I made a small jar of it and saved me some $$.  Thanks again."
1800297135,258672,2015-12-16,5,Thank you soooo much. Saved me 10$ for a tiny jar of allspice by making my own out of spices I always have on hand.
2000875756,258672,2016-02-15,4,"Wish I discovered your Allspice recipe six years ago, approximately the time you originally posted it.  I now make my own and keep in a small jar. Some recipes, like my crockpot pinto beans, I&#039;ll reduce nutmeg and cloves, per your suggestion. I use the the full-on version for baking.  Thank you, so much, for posting this fabulous, yet simple, recipe!!!"
169300,258672,2016-10-28,5,"My daughter is allergic to allspice, and your mix is the perfect solution. Thank you so much for posting this!"

983832,492939,2014-07-20,5,"Coated a couple rib-eyes in brown sugar, grilled, drizzled reduction sauce over top. Delicious. Thank you."
65308,67295,2003-09-05,4,"This was really good!  My son absolutely loved it.  The only thing I would change is to cut the French bread dough in half and make two smaller loafs rather than one big one.  The big one was difficult to work with, and some of the dough didn't quite get crispy and brown - it was a little soggy. With these few changes, I think this recipe's a winner!"
56181,67295,2004-02-29,5,Yum!  So easy to throw together and so good.  I made my own french bread dough in my ABM instead of buying it and it worked great!  I also used Easy Homemade Pizza Sauce recipe #60997 by Zenith.  This is definitely one I'll be making again!  Thanks Elmolvsu!
1083626,177503,2008-12-18,0,Have been making this for years.  I brush the layers of filo dough with melted butter.  I have even made these bite size for hors d'ouerves.   I some times serve it as an apitizer. They go well with a glass of Pinot Grigio.  It's a 5 star for me!
159486,163412,2006-10-30,5,"Made this with 2 lbs of meatballs for a party. They were so easy to make and everyone loved them. They were gone in no time!

Thanks"
169341,163412,2007-06-12,5,"very  easy..hard to beleive this was this easy and turned out sooo
good.Thanks,a party staple from now on!"
654638,163412,2009-06-25,5,"Delicious!  I always make these in the crockpot, and I always let them cook for at least three hours on high.  Great over white rice with sugar snap peas on the side."
373404,163412,2010-04-23,5,"We had to rush around and find something late last night that could be thrown together quickly for dh to take to a work potluck.  He decided meatballs in the crockpot would be easy, but I didn't want to do the ""same ole, same ole"" grape jelly BBQ meatballs.  I lucked into this recipe on the back of the bag, and dh said it got rave reviews.  I cooked them on the stovetop last night, and then he just took them to work and kept them on low all morning.  He and I split one last night, and it was really yummy!  It's almost like a sweet and sour kind of flavor, with just the tiniest little kick to it.  The apricots really tone down the spiciness of the salsa.  They're really good!"
1803032305,163412,2014-08-14,1,"This recipe was waaaay too sweet for my taste. I set it up in the crockpot before I went to work, and when I got home and tasted it, I thought for sure I&#039;d read the recipe wrong! Tried adding onions and Worcestershire to the sauce, but it still wasn&#039;t edible."
86318,35998,2003-12-11,5,"This recipe made tender, jam-filled bars that we enjoyed."
534623,35998,2007-10-19,3,"I'm giving these 3 stars because they were super quick and easy to make, and quite tasty. I thought about giving it less stars, though, because the measurement seemed wrong to me. There is no way it was going to fit a 9 x 13 pan, I had to put it into a smaller square pan. Also, they tasted way too salty to me. Still, these were good, and I'd like to try them with different types of preserves and maybe mess around with the measurements a bit. Thanks for sharing."
285039,229851,2007-09-23,4,"I make a dozen variations of this recipe and this is a good one. To make it creamier I typically add 8 oz of cream cheese in addition to the items listed.  This time, however, I made it as listed but without the crunchy topping.  Always a crowd pleaser!"
204024,229851,2007-12-12,4,This is good and easy.  I followed the recipe except for not adding onions.  I made this for my friends family and they don't like onions.  Made for BT 2007
441518,229851,2008-01-17,5,I too make a dozen varieties of this recipe and they always turn out terrific.
1132794,229851,2009-04-26,5,I LOVE this cheesy potatoe recipe - it is perfection in a crockpot!  I also add 8 oz. of cream cheese (regular or light neufatchel) and it turns out delicious every time.
157425,229851,2009-05-27,5,"We loved these potatoes! I made half the recipe and used the cheddar cheese soup, french fried onions, and dried minced onion. Nice and golden brown when taken out of the oven and some of the potatoes were crispy around the edges, my favorites. Thank you Crafty Lady 13 for sharing this recipe. Made and reviewed for the Australia/NewZealand Forums Recipe Tag #28."
489552,229851,2009-08-31,5,"Perfect cheesy potato hash browns.   I love cheese so this was right up my ally with my burger dinner for today.  It sure made a lot, next time I will 1/2 the recipe and believe me there will be a next time.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Photo Tag Game"
242729,423604,2010-11-08,5,"DEEELISH Choccie! Made whilst in the UK for me, as mum and dad are veggies and I fancied some meat one day! Fluffy and full of flavour, I loved this. Made as a prize for the Scandinavia game in Europe on a Plate forum! Merci encore - photos to be posted later. PS: I also used fresh chives from the garden as well as local oak cured bacon."
869184,423604,2011-04-07,5,This was delish! Fast to throw together and light and fluffy dinner. I used self raising flour and turkey bacon to lighten it a bit; 35 min in the oven worked for me. Served with toasted sourdough bread.
461834,423604,2012-05-09,5,"Wonderful and flavorful breakfast!!!  I made 1/3 of the recipe and served with fresh fruit instead of the tomato.  Since I scaled this back, I baked it for about 20-25 minutes, which worked perfectly.  The eggs are so light and fluffy but so flavorful from the chives and bacon.  The only thing I changed was to add a little bit of shredded cheddar, yum!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for your win in the Trivia Challenge in the Games Forum."
169868,204723,2007-01-11,5,"i haven't tried this recipe, but it's exactly the same as what my grandma made for me and my mom both when we were growing up!! so yummy and hard to eat just one"
29406,204723,2007-01-12,0,I make these too using an English Muffin.
1072378,204723,2009-03-01,5,"Absolutely delicious. My Dad used to make these for us when we were young. I made them for my kids. Now my daughter is making them for her kids. We usually cut the slices of bread in half and then put a half slice of cheese on each, then top with a slice of tomato. For crunchier bacon, we put a slice on each portion for the last few minutes of broiling. Yummy!!"
914720,204723,2009-03-02,5,"When I was growing up, this was one of my favorite ""special treat"" lunches in the summer, with tomatoes fresh from the garden.  We usually put the cheese on top, to kind of melt everything else together to make it easier to eat.  Thanks for the stroll down memory lane."
482769,245429,2007-09-19,3,"I think that this is a good recipe, however, I found that an hour for baking time was a little too long and the bread had begun to burn. Other than that, I found it to have a really good flavor and I would recommend this recipe to others."
4740,401089,2012-11-11,5,Really good really easy cookie recipe. Yum. Not too heavy not too sweet little bit of crunch little bit of saltiness a little addicting.
286566,181029,2007-07-02,5,These just made a delightfully light delicious lunch for myself.  I had 4 small/medium field mushrooms that took a 1 tablespoon of cottage cheese in each with the black pepper and a sprinkle of dried herbs and baked in the oven (180 degree C) for 15 minutes.  I think it would also go well with some finely chopped chives.  Thank you Peter for another mushroom recipe for my cookbook.  Made for Recipe Swap #6 July 2007.
482812,181029,2007-07-18,3,"These weren't anything special for me.  I tried making them twice (since I love mushrooms and I love cottage cheese). The first time I used black pepper and the second time I used barbeque spice, but I couldn't get the spices to come through on flavor.  I didn't dislike them, I just have other dishes I would prefer over them."
68960,181029,2007-08-02,5,"Peter, these are excellent. I should have made more as Dave and I are fighting over the last one!  Tonight I sprinkled my mushrooms with a bit of garlic salt, covered with cottage cheese and then sprinkled the top with cayenne pepper. It's still a bit cool to be cooking outside so I cooked in the oven. Will definitely be making these again very soon."
35925,181029,2009-07-06,5,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but wanted to try because they sounded healthy.  My only complaint is that I didn't make enough!  Couldn't wait, so I started sampling them while they were on the grill, and there weren't many left when they finally were done.  Have more mushrooms in the fridge, so will be making again this week.  Melt in your mouth fantastic!"
377161,181029,2010-05-05,5,"Very easy, and very tasty!! Will 
make again.Really enjoyed these!
Thanks for sharing!"
4470,181029,2010-05-23,5,"I make these all the time - they are so tasty the only difference is that I sprinkle on some hot chili flakes and usually do them in the toaster oven - heat set at 375, uncovered for apprx 20 minutes or until the cottage cheese is all bubbly and starting to brown-  Thanks for reminding me to make these again   Thanks for posting PeterJ

24 May 09  Made these again I had forgotten how good they are Mmmm

5 April 2010 Yep made them again - this time I had some left over chopped Jalapenos so I mixed them into the Cottage cheese Mmmmmmm- Lovely - I used  very large brown mushrooms.

And yet again 23 May 10  This time I chopped a roasted garlic clove in each mushroom cap and sprinkled Adobo spice on top  Love these cottage cheese stuffed muchroom"
58439,181029,2014-05-06,5,Love the ease and simplicity! I had some quark on hand (European cottage cheese to use up) and this was perfect! Next time I can see myself adding roasted red capsicum or speck! Thanks Peter J! Made as part of the AUS/NZ May Recipe Swap!
537188,93924,2008-07-11,4,I really liked the combination of the apple and carrot...I wasn't so sure about the topping though. Maybe I put a bit too much flour on as some of it just stayed as it was and didn't get soaked up whilst in the oven. However I don't want to sound too negative as it was a good recipe! Thanks.
48388,113789,2005-03-23,0,"As an Aussie living in the USA, I would like to clarify that the Coon cheese is a brand of medium to sharp cheddar cheese. The name has nothing to do with racoons and has no derogatory meaning :)"
37449,314083,2009-04-29,5,"What a filling, yummy sandwich this made! I used veggie bacon and made 1 sandwich. Thanks for posting! :D"
136997,314083,2010-04-07,5,"Wonderful sandwich. I had to omit the tomato, as I didn't have any, but wanted to try the recipe anyway. :)"
174096,314083,2012-11-04,5,Great breakfast sandwich!  Filling and flavorful.  I ended up using 1/2 avocado and tomato and neufchatel cheese.  The addition of the parsley and green onion to the cheese really added a nice touch.  Thanks for sharing.  PAC Fall '12
128473,314083,2013-04-14,5,"I really enjoyed this tasty sandwich.  It was so good, everything complimented one another, nothing over powered and together, they created a memorable sandwich. Quick and easy to make, perfectly balanced, satisfying and addictive.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, I will be enjoying this often.  What a great way to start the day.  Made for  Pac Spring Safari 2013."
286566,314083,2013-11-20,5,"Great lunch for the DM and I which we thoroughly enjoyed, thank you Frugal Chef, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
1772585,314083,2014-10-21,0,"Instead of toasting the bread, put the sandwich together, and put back in the buttery pan to toast and melt the cheese."
26719,113789,2005-04-26,4,"Small edit at the end:
Bacon and banana? Together? I wondered at first, but the adventurous rebel in me had to try it and I'm so glad I did! This was very good, the combo of flavours very different yet very tasty. Indescribable. You really have to try this! The banana was warm, soft, but not mushy. Since I have no oven b/c my hardwood floors are being redone, I'm pretty limited in what I can make. I microwaved the bacon and used the toaster oven to make the toast and then switched to broil to finish it up once I put the bacon, banana and cheese on. It was done lickety split! I sliced the banana in half, then sliced each half lengthwise into thirds. I used shredded cheddar cheese and placed in the TO on the flat pan for about 2 minutes on broil. I'm at a high altitude, so those of you who aren't, please watch it as it will be done quicker where you are. It was quick, easy and VERY tasty and the best thing is the ingredients are usually on hand in all kitchens. My only suggestion is I made 2 pieces of toast per the directions, but with typical bacon shrinkage, the two slices only covered one piece of toast, so I recco you double the bacon if you want two pieces of this fabulous treat. I can see why this was a favourite munchy after a night at the pub! This would be great to serve at a casual party by using a french loaf sliced in half lengthwise, broil in the oven and then slice into fingers, much like garlic bread. I will be making this again for a quick snack or to serve guests who come over for a casual party or sporting event. 
ETA: My dh didn't care for this.  He didn't like the combo of sweet and savoury, so even though I really liked it, it may be one of those types that you either really like or you don't.  I still like it. "
88099,113789,2005-10-02,4,This was an odd combination but I liked the sweetness of the banana with the taste of sharp cheddar cheese.  Nice for a change of pace.  Thanks Catherine
200270,113789,2006-09-09,4,"Such an unusual combination it just had to be tried. My DH and I really enjoyed these for lunch, in fact Dh wanted them the next day. I used Old Smoothy vintage cheese and that seemed to work very well. One quick recipe that will be used again and again."
424680,113789,2010-04-15,5,"This was easy enough to make especially when, instead of grilling bacon, I sprinkled a generous tablespoon of bacon bits over the toast before adding the sliced banana & cheddar cheese! Very unusual & tasty snack, & I think these, cut even smaller, would make a nice addition to my finger food counter when I'm hosting! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed for one of my adopted chefs in the current Pick A Chef event]"
542159,113789,2011-03-12,4,Uncommon but nice combo! DH found the sweet banana to be a nice contrast to the salt of the bacon and sharpness of the cheese. This was made using American slices as that is what I had on hand and pre-cooked bacon. With DH hovering only got one pre-cut photo that was only so-so and thus did not post sorry. Thanks for the post.
1358120,4133,2010-01-18,5,"This was a simple and very tasty side dish! One medium squash could easily serve 6 as a side. We used garlic powder and added salt, pepper, and few pats of butter on top before cooking. We also made sure to take out the dish halfway through baking and toss the squash so everything was well-marinated."
4470,4133,2010-02-27,5,"We really enjoyed your recipe.  It is so easy to put together and can be done ahead of time then pop it in the oven 45 minutes before dinner, The hardest part of this recipe is cutting the raw squash but a bit of perseverance fixed that.  All this time that the recipe has been posted and only one previous review I am so surprised because the recipe is so good!"
542159,375113,2011-09-19,5,"A very satisfying sandwich! Was mildly concerned that the cheddar cheese would over power the apricots (which we do so love) but good quality mild cheddar did not over power instead it made a tasty warm blanket for this sweet little sandwich. I made using lightly toasted 7 grain bread and over ripe fresh apricots, would recommend anyone trying this with canned apricots dry them with paper towels.  Thanks for the post."
599450,375113,2011-11-05,5,"This is surprisingly lighter than I thought it would be. This is the kind of lunch sandwich my Finnish grandmother would have made for us when my sib's and I were kids. Tasty and so simple! Thanks for posting, Sydney Mike. Made for 123HW tag game."
409184,212191,2007-04-08,4,"Made this as a side dish for our Easter dinner. DH loves asparagus. One out of two teenage DD's enjoyed it. It did take longer than 8 minutes for it to come to the desired consistency. Overall, a nice, easy to prepare, recipe."
701846,212191,2008-01-21,4,Simply delicious!!
44642,212191,2009-10-21,5,"This is the only way I cook asparagus. But I just put it on the foil with what you use and mix it up. But I bet cooking it frist
would be better. going to try that.
Thanks Shadows"
844554,212191,2010-03-30,5,"We loved this! Two of my favorite ingredients - parsley and garlic. Next time, I'll add more garlic and more parsley. Delicious!"
542159,212191,2012-03-24,5,A nice alternative to my normal garlic saut?ed asparagus! I made as written and was wishing we had some bacon so that I could have tried the suggestion in step 9. Thanks for the tasty post.
41809,33882,2002-09-02,5,"This Danish is Superb!!!  Just has a wonderful taste and aroma.
I cut each ingredient in half as I only had 4 apples.  Still made a nice size dessert.
You ought to be proud because it's worth more than 5 stars!!
Thanks so much for sharing.

444504,33882,2007-02-18,5,"THank you so much for this delicious vintage recipe! Recipes handed down are a treasure, and I will treasure this one!  It is easy and authentic and heart-warming!"
383877,33882,2007-02-24,5,"lovely danish, I made mine with half gluten free flour and half plain flour and was really delicious, forgot to put in the butter between the layers so a bit drier than I would imagine it to be but can't wait to make again and add some other fruit into it as well, thanks for a great recipe."
597071,33882,2009-07-06,5,Wonderful recipe. My first ever danish and was looking for something authentic. This is the one for me. I cant wait to share it it with my church.
199848,100783,2005-08-30,5,"These are great!  My kids and I ate this for lunch today.  The sauce gets nice and thick.  I used light sour cream.  I reccommend using the broiler to make the cheese nice and bubbly.
I think next time I will add some minced onion or garlic to the sauce.  Thanx for this recipe!"
29782,100783,2005-09-20,5,What a new way of fixing brussel sprouts! It was very delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe. 
125458,100783,2006-01-02,3,"Nice, but I don't think brussels sprouts works totally well in a gratin form. I think I will just stick to sauteed or roasted, but this was nice enough to try anyway."
236760,100783,2006-09-08,5,Delicious!  My kids and I love this recipe!  It is a nice change from plain or vinegared sprouts.  The sour cream gives it a nice smooth flavor.  Would be great using monterey jack cheese as well.  Thanks!
369715,100783,2008-11-12,4,We love brussel sprouts and this was a different way for me to make them. We enjoyed them but thought they needed a bit more seasoning. I did add a good bit of pepper but think it could have used some garlic too. I followed the recipe as written other then I cooked the whole thing on the stove.
988480,319082,2008-11-18,5,This was fabulous! Easy to prepare and delicious!
646279,319082,2008-12-13,4,"This was really tasty and really easy.  The quick browning before you put it in the oven really seals in the juices so it was so tender and juicy!  The only change I might make would be to add a but more brown sugar and cook the glaze down a bit more next time because while the flavor was nice, it wasn't really a ""glaze"" texture.  We will definitely be trying this one again soon though!"
153188,319082,2010-07-13,5,"This was amazing!  I followed the recipe to the T.  I do agree with Chef #646279 it was more a sauce texture, but it was so dippable and finger licking!  This will definitely be made again.  Thanks for a very good main course for our dinner tonight!"
420799,319082,2010-10-13,5,Tasty and easy - will use recipe again...
1222615,319082,2011-01-10,5,"Excellent!  Uses ingredients that are always in the pantry, simple and quick to prepare, tender and delicious to eat.  Need I say more?"
2000318449,319082,2015-07-05,5,"Sooooooo easy, fantastic!"
174096,486479,2012-10-28,5,"Yum!  These are delicious and filling.  I used cheddar cheese, tomato, and onion for the filling this time, but the combos are endless, and this would be a great way to use up little bits of veggie or meat leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!  PAC Fall '12"
695933,486479,2012-10-29,5,"Very easy breakfast recipe. Quick enough to make before work and still get there on time! I subbed red bell peppers for the tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe. Amazingly tasty for a low cal breakfast. Along with being incredibly easy, it's a great base recipe and easy to modify depending on your tastes. I've will added this to my recipe book with my additions. I can do the happy food dance!! THANK YOU!! GRPA"
369715,486479,2012-10-30,4,These were good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written. I used onions and green peppers in the filling. I also added pepper to the eggs. My family enjoyed these. Made for Fall PAC 2012
954954,486479,2012-11-11,1,"The bacon didn't cook all the way through, and the egg seeped out and stuck to the muffin tin, so it wasn't a really a super star for me.  Edible, but I probably wouldn't make again...lots of grease...and now a really baked on mess to clean up."
2124708,486479,2012-11-12,5,"These were amazing! I only had thick cut bacon, and at 25 min, it didn't looked quite done, so I left it in for another 8 minutes for the bacon to finish up. I was worried the egg would cook through too much, but it turned out quite perfect! I made a half batch for the fiance and I, and we had three each.  I used 6 pieces of bacon, 4 eggs, some milk, tomatoes, left over rotisserie chicken and cheddar.  My muffin tin was non-stick to begin with, but I sprayed the tin as the recipe stated anyways.  These didn't stick AT ALL!  They popped out easily when they were done.  The thick cut bacon REALLY made these turn out wonderful, and I highly suggest it. :)"
583193,486479,2013-01-04,3,"These were okay.  The bacon never got cooked and I really dislike soggy, limp bacon. The flavor was good so maybe next time, I'll cook the bacon partway before adding to the tin?"
400708,486479,2013-12-24,5,"One amazing recipe.  From the photo and description I was concerned that the bacon wouldn&#039;t get done all the way but it was perfect.  Added chopped sausage, red peppers, and onions to the mix then followed as directed.  It was so easy and looked really pretty.  I did cut the recipe in half thinking it&#039;d be enough and I shouldn&#039;t have, everyone loved it and was asking for more.  We topped with a sour cream and a few shakes of hot sauce."
2352596,486479,2014-08-26,4,"I made these for dinner tonight. They were easy, tasty and filling. I used thick cut maple wood smoked bacon because thats what I like. I used a mix of sharp chedder and provolone cheese. I added sauted mushrooms and some roasted red pepper to the filling and topped them with fresh sliced avacado when they came out of the oven. This is a great recipe because its really easy and you can use whatever flavor of cheese, veg, meat you like without having to tweak the basic recipe in any way. I think next time I&#039;ll add a little ham but the avacado topper is what made it for me."
1803560010,486479,2014-12-25,4,"Great easy breakfast to start a busy day.  I recommend draining these on a paper towel before serving, just like you would with bacon.  I find them a bit too greasy if I don&#039;t.  I also cook them for about 4 minutes longer to get the bacon fully cooked.  Hope you like them as much as our house full of boys do!"
1803757388,486479,2015-02-07,0,The bacon didn&#039;t cook all the way through I cooked this for an extra 15 minutes and the bacon is still raw and looks awful. The egg stuck to the tin and thy are loaded with grease . I wnt make them again 1 muffin tin down
2000915948,486479,2016-03-12,5,"Made these this morning and they were great! I used tomatoes and onions for the filling. I also decided to use Mexican shredded cheese. These cooked perfectly! The bacon was completely done after the 25 minutes and the eggs were so pillowy! We decided to eat them with slasa and they tasted GREAT! Also, I used 9 eggs (since that&#039;s what the recipe said to use if you wanted taller filling) and it ended up being too much as instead of 8 muffins it ended up making 12, bit they&#039;re amazing, so who&#039;s to complain?! Thank you for a great recipe!"
2002309723,486479,2018-10-23,0,"to get the texture of starbucks,( they are cooked in a vacuum seal bag ) you wold have to either buy a sous vide cooker ( how they are made) or could poach them in an egg poacher, and if you are an instata pot person, I think they have an insert to cook them, that is what makes them really good, only other thing is to try some 1/2&amp;1/2 instead of milk or cut down cheese ( will make them creamier like a quiche."
1350389,190541,2013-04-14,5,"Good and easy.  I didn&#039;t have any bacon so used deli meat with 2 pcs of asparagus on each slice on wheat bread.  I can imagine bacon taking this over the top in taste, but taste was good my way I thought."
2744787,190541,2013-05-18,5,"A friend of mine did something similar for her daughter&#039;s bridal shower... she had the white bread without crusts, flattened, the pickled asparagus, and the cream cheese, she did everything except add the bacon and green onions, and she did not bake them, those things were gone within 5 minutes... and she made five trays!! It was the first time I had had pickled asparagus.... I wonder if you could use gluten free bread for this......."
68715,185886,2007-05-18,4,Good flavour. Extremely fine-textured. Must have cheese melted on top.
369715,499911,2013-05-21,4,I used two heads of broccoli as I didn&#039;t have any cauliflower but followed the rest of the recipe as written. It made for a nice salad on a hot and humid day.
41983082,499911,2014-03-06,5,"This salad is sooooo yummy!!! The dressing is a tad on the sweet side, but you could cut back the sugar. I substituted pepper bacon real bacon pieces (in the salad fixings aisle) for the bacon (no cook, no mess) and I used pre-shredded triple cheddar blend cheese. All I can say is WOW!! I will definitely be making this again!!!!"
2246854,499911,2014-05-18,5,Cut sugar to 1/3 cup. Threw in some grated parmeson. YUM
1802751806,499911,2014-05-19,5,"This is an awesome salad!! The bad news is it is NO WHERE near 15 minute prep time!! By the time I cooked 1/2 pound of bacon, washed cut and chopped both a head of cauliflower and broccoli, (and I used the Vidalia Onion chopper to do it!!), then broke apart the bacon, added the dressing, etc. it was about 1/2 hour to 45 minutes by the time I put it in the fridge.  It is worth it, but unrealistic to say it is 15 minutes from start to finish."
1802799772,499911,2014-06-05,5,"This is a great salad recipe. On the second batch, For a little flare I used cracked pepper olive oil mayonnaise. It gave it a nice kick and offset the sweetness. I also added sunflower seeds and golden raisins. A new favorite!"
623399,499911,2016-08-01,5,"AMAZING!!! I have seen this same recipe posted over and over on Facebook the last couple of years and kept forgetting to save it. I finally made this and I can tell I will be making it all the time. I only made half the recipe and only used broccoli since I didn't have cauliflower. It is great with only broccoli if you don't have the cauliflower. I did add in some chopped onion and a little parmesan cheese to the dressing. This was amazingly flavorful and so good to serve right away if you don't have time to refrigerate. After about 2 hours in the fridge is did slightly break down the broccoli but it was still very crunchy and creamy, which is the way I like it. Amazing, Amazingly good! Whomever was the original creator to this recipe, thank you for the super yummy recipe!"
1800324154,499911,2016-08-25,4,"I agree that the prep time is way more than 15 minutes for one worker. I have made this several times and have reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and increased the salt to 1 teaspoon, the cheese to 2 cups and added 1/4 cup grated parmesan. I chop the vegetables fairly finely and it makes about 3 quarts of salad."
2001240481,499911,2016-11-10,5,"Excellent, and very tasty. But...it takes a long time to make and frankly, I like quick and easy. This is delicious but it is not quick. The 15 minute prep time? I have no idea how that was done in 15 minutes. The chopping alone too me forever."
2001544729,499911,2017-05-19,0,"I have made this several times. Agree the prep time is way longer than they say. Also, Imreduce the mayo, sour cream and sugar by about half. Still flavorable but less runny and less fat. If serving to friends who don't eat bacon,, I replace the bacon with red onion or vadalia onion. Gives it a different flare."
2001564667,499911,2017-06-01,0,"I've made this for several years, and it's a favorite every time I make it. I add about 1/2 cup of red onion along with green pepper. A good addition."
2001652763,499911,2017-08-01,5,"I love this salad. Usually, when I buy broccoli and cauliflower, I clean, cut it up and place in ziploc bags for future use. I also use bacon bits, sunflower seeds, cranberries and parmesan for an extra kick."
2001032416,499911,2018-03-23,4,"I really don't see why it took people so long to make this. The 15 minute prep time is increased to MAYBE 20 minutes if you do it right. So here is what you do. Pre heat your oven to 400&deg;F, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, place your bacon on the pan and bake while you prep the rest of the ingredients. Flip it about 10 minutes through and continue baking as you prep the rest of the ingredients until the bacon is about as crisp as you want it to be. If you do this you are incorporating the bacon cook time into the vegetable and dressing prep time therefore making a more efficient use of your time. OR if you plan to make bacon on a day or so before you make this salad, just make extra and hide it from the family. That way you have some on hand. That all aside, I found this to be a tad on the sweet side. I think next time I make this I will decrease the sugar by a bit. I plan to experiment with other ingredients also. There are a lot of possibilities for this salad. I find it to be a great summer time side dish."
2002228460,499911,2018-07-24,5,"This is a great salad. I'm low carb/keto, so replaced sugar w/ a few drops of liquid stevia in the dressing and added some slivered almonds for crunch. Quite delicious."
169796,135967,2005-09-05,5,"yes, I agree! This is a VERY good dish, and so different from most breakfast dishes!"
28636,135967,2006-01-16,5,"I really enjoyed this, especially the ""apple crisp"" flavor and texture, so very different than the usual gummy texture of oatmeal.  I made this on a weekend morning, put leftovers in the fridge and will reheat portions in the microwave during the busy work week.  Thanks for helping me get my oats!"
254614,161428,2006-04-24,5,This is MY kind of salad. I LOVE IT. Now hubby can't eat bacon or vinegar so I serve him plain with pepper and or hot sauce and salt substitute. I use Hormel bacon pieces in a sack. Excellent.
90767,161428,2006-05-04,5,Excellent salad!  I love all the different textures that are in it and the taste is outstanding.  Will be making often.
180898,161428,2006-06-03,5,"We loved this. DH piled it high on his plate. I left out the hot sauce 'cause DH doesn't like it. I also didn't read well when I chose to make the salad and didn't realize it should sit for so long. It sat for about an hour, no problems, still wonderful. There is nothing leftover (and there were only 2 of us eating lol) so I wont get to see how it does sitting longer. Oh well. This is something I am sure I will be making often. Thanks for a great recipe."
101823,161428,2008-06-12,5,"I am behind in my reviewing, but I prepared this a few weeks ago (before the current salmonella tomato scare).  The salad was fabulous.  It was a quick, easy, and filling lunch that will be repeated when tomatoes are safe once again."
98722,196264,2007-05-19,4,"This is a good idea for all that leftover zucchini.  I left out the sugar as my tomatoes were sweet enough.  We had it on homemade pizza, very good.  Thanks!"
1182736,196264,2009-07-19,4,"Great Idea for the zucchini, I added fresh herbs and garlic.  Be great for a quick meal later. Thanks a lot for another good idea."
98812,162362,2006-03-31,4,"My favorite use for my indoor grill is making sandwiches.  This kind is my favorite, too!  However, I don't butter the bread at all (a nod at trying to be healthy) although I do admit to adding extra cheese.  It's wonderful!"
545375,162362,2007-07-31,5,Genuine grilled cheese the easy way
305531,162362,2009-09-03,5,Yummy! I used a stovetop grill pan and loved this simple sandwich. Thanks juniperwoman for a great treat. Made for Cookbook Tag.
602947,234946,2011-03-09,3,"I had a recipe like this so I printed this one off as I couldn't find the first one. Do not use 8 1/2 cups of apples.  My recipe calls for 6-8 apples and 6 is plenty. The bread should be sliced into  1 inch slices...not 1 1/2. The baking time is over one hour, so prepare for that.   Chef #602947 from Punta Gorda, Florida"
18391,109267,2006-03-14,5,Nice and simple! Thank you!
6357,109267,2005-01-26,5,My dad enjoys this one once in a while. He quite likes it:) Easy and quick delight!
68960,109267,2005-09-18,5,"My daughters absolutely loved this. I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and popped back under the grill for a few minutes. An excellent, filling breakfast. Thanks Kellogs :)"
104295,109267,2005-10-18,5,"Super fast and really tasty.  I used light bread and spray butter.  Originally I sliced the banana in rounds and then decided that probably you meant for me to slice it in half, so I just ate the banana slices and used the sliced long ways banana on my bread.  Yum!"
32671,8606,2002-03-04,5,it is different and i think my family should like it
659896,8606,2008-10-13,5,Very delicious and easy in a pinch.  I would recommend adding some oregano and basil to the sauce just to make it a little more interesting.
2002039032,535830,2018-06-08,0,instant pudding mix? does it make a difference?
2001004813,535830,2018-06-08,0,Im thinking of soaking the wafers in coconut rum and/or coffee and chocolate liquer.
247530,535830,2018-06-09,0,I won't be making this NASTY sounding cake.
8631,8470,2001-11-08,4,This was very tasty.  My husband inhaled it within 2 days.
35701,8470,2002-06-21,3,"The fruit combo, and spices on the fruit were really good.  However, the ""crisp"" part was not very crispy, and remained powdery, even after baking.  It never got golden brown.  As a whole, it was good, but I've had better."
598240,8470,2008-11-03,0,This dish was very tasty!  I read the second review and substituted 4T of butter for the oil and the topping came out crispier. WTG Belinda
593927,8470,2010-02-15,3,3 1/2 stars. This wasn't near to as good as any crisp I have ever had even with canola oil. I made this just apple crisp as I didn't have any blueberries but chose this recipe because I didn't have butter and wanted a crisp recipe. I didn't find it sweet enough and I am usually one to cut down sugar. I made it gluten free with Recipe #256259 instead of unbleached flour. The sugar I used was demura dark brown crystals. I doubled the topping out of preference and it definitely needs more canola oil than called for because even with a bit extra the topping was still very dry as another reviewer also noted. Butter does makes crisps better.
197023,8606,2009-01-22,5,"I loved the sound of this mushroom sauce and was certainly not disappointed. I made it as the sauce to use in Linda's Busy Kitchen's Recipe #254585, which I was making a large quantity of to put in the freezer. So I made four times the recipe. Proportionally, I used less Worcestershire sauce: I appreciate the subtle flavour it adds but I am always wary of its heat. I used Aldi's canned,  chopped Italian tomatoes (the best around) and I added three leeks as I love the blend of leeks, onions and garlic. I also added some rosemary, sage and thyme as we love that blend. This was a really delicious sauce and one I'll be making again. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Claire."
861336,8606,2009-12-28,5,"Love this recipe. Quick, easy and delicious."
5060,8606,2010-03-27,4,"Very tasty sauce with the mushrooms, parsley, garlic and onion, the combination adds lots of depth to the tomatoes.  Love the touch of Worcestershire sauce and I used lots of pepper.  I cut the oil down to just one tablespoon, a quarter cup seemed like a lot.  Worked out just fine.  Served over spaghetti with turkey meatballs.  Loved how quick it was to put together and will be making it again, thanks for posting."
1346465,8606,2010-05-21,5,"Wow ... this is seriously good. I added about 1/8C white wine and 1/2t of Italian seasoning during the simmer, but the recipe probably didn't need them. By the second or third bite, you're hooked!"
1928133,8606,2011-06-09,4,This is the first time I tried to make spaghetti and I am very sure that it will become one of the usual suspects during a time and taste crisis. My parents and sister liked it so much that they actually told me that I had become taller even though I stopped growing a couple of years ago. I am usually very critical about my cooking but I have to admit that your recipe made me feel like a decent cook. Thanks a ton.
239706,8606,2011-12-24,5,"I was in the need for a quick sauce tonight, and this one fit the bill since I had all of the ingredients. I was so pleased with it. I added some fresh oregano and thyme which I had growing in the garden. I also added a pinch of sugar to counterbalance my not-so-fresh tomatoes. I think I will add white wine next time as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for the perfect recipe. I'll definitely do this one again!<br/><br/>Revised 8/23/10 -- Just cooked this sauce again. This time I used fresh garden tomatoes and a white wine I had in my fridge. I again added fresh oregano and also a little fresh basil. Boy was this good! I'm not much of a cook, but this would be a good recipe for guests. Can I add a sixth star?"
464080,8606,2013-05-02,4,"I had a cup of diced tomatoes and 8 oz of baby Bella mushrooms in the fridge is this fit the bill.  Mine was very watery and a bit bland so I added a little white wine, a pinch of sugar, some Italian seasoning and simmered it for almost 40 minutes to dry it up a bit.  Since it was watery I chose to serve it atop some truffled polenta.  The combo of the two was four stars (the truffle flavor boosted the dish) but the sauce alone would be 3 in my book."
457690,309827,2008-12-07,5,Yum!
869532,309827,2009-09-01,4,"They tasted pretty good. But the mixture wouldn't hold together. I think next time I would have to leave them in the water longer.
I didn't deep fry but only pan fry them."
424680,301951,2008-05-24,5,"Great tasting jam/spread/sauce, whatever you want to call it & however you want to use it! So easy & wonderful! Definitely keeping this around so I can make some of the other variations, too! [Tagged, made & reviewed for the Summer Salad & Berry Recipe Challange]"
252514,301951,2011-08-07,5,"This makes a nice tasting, tart jam. And it comes together very FAST! I didn't strain out the raspberry seeds as I had this on wheat toast and it was fine that way. But if using as a sauce for ice cream, I would probably go the extra mile and strain out the seeds. Thank you, JackieOhNo! [Made for the All You Can Cook Buffet special]"
542159,301951,2011-08-25,5,"Wow this really is the best thing since sliced bread! There are lots of things to love about this recipe, it tasty great, it's easy, it makes just over a cup and has lots of yummy variations. I made strawberry and am looking forward to trying the other flavors. Thanks so much for the post."
840768,237028,2012-04-01,5,"OMG!  We loved these bagels.  For us, what makes this special to a regular breakfast bagel is the addition of the cream cheese & chive mixture.  And, instead of sprinkling the bagel with the garlic powder, I added it to the cream cheese along with a vegy herb spice I have.  Really enjoyed the addition of the sliced avocados and I added some sauted bell peppers & onions to the eggs.  Nicely unique & very tasty recipe that is equally easy to put together, thanks so much for sharing."
383346,507298,2013-10-07,5,I made this non alcoholic drink for my son and he liked it a lot.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for Rookie tag game
37449,241948,2007-08-02,4,This made a nice spread for my toast! Thanks!
531310,241948,2007-08-03,5,This was delicious!!!  I ended up melting butter mashing the avocado and adding the rest of the ingredients for a spread for a sandwich.  I used fresh lime juice and cilantro.  I want to try this again on Salmon making recipe exactly as stated!!!!
330505,241948,2007-08-26,4,Very tasty.  I've never had avocado butter before.  I used it on my tilapia tonight and it added a nice tangy flavor.
336058,241948,2007-09-16,4,"Mine doesn't look as pretty as the picture! :oops:  But it still turned out good.  I had made this awhile ago and finally got around to trying it on tilapia tonight recipe#232657.  It was great.  You could tell there was Worcest. in it.  I had my 8 yo try it bcz he loves fish and he said, ""I like it a little bit,"" which is good.  He tried something unusual and didn't spit it out! :lol:  I think this keeps for awhile, as I've had it in fridge for at least a week.  I did cheat and use margarine, so it's not as stiff.  I did try some on the noodles too."
75919,65417,2004-04-16,5,I had a salad like this at an expensive Italian restaurant in Toronto. You can't get much simpler than this recipe and it is still so flavorful. Personally I like a bit more lemon juice so I added about a tablespoon.
80353,65417,2006-05-13,5,"This wonderful salad is sheer simplicity and packed with great flavour!  I love arugula (called 'roka' here in Greece) and buy it up every week at our farmer's market.  This is probably one of the best ways of making it - allowing the arugula to star, but a few shaved parmesan curls were a delightful addition!"
6258,65417,2007-02-22,5,"Bev, this is wonderful.  I love the simplicity and the freshness.  With so few ingredients, it was elegantly sophisticated, and I was delighted to serve it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Definately going into my t&t cookbook! :-)"
354675,65417,2007-06-18,5,"This was fab, Bev!  I love arugula, I love simple, so this is the perfect salad for me.  I did grate parmesan cheese over the top, b/c I have to add cheese to everything.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
176615,65417,2007-07-06,5,Wonderful and simple! Made as stated with light olive oil. The peppery flavor of arugula is perfectly evident. Love the suggestion of a shaving a fresh parm and will try that next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
56061,65417,2007-11-17,5,"We love this salad.  The spiciness of the arugula is perfect with that tart bite of lemon.  Like other reviewers, I enjoy a bit more tartness, so I increase the amount of lemon juice.  I also add a good grinding of black pepper as we serve this.  When we have arugula in the house, my kids will pick it over any vegie.  This is their favorite way to have it."
178365,65417,2008-05-29,5,"I couldn't believe how good this was.  It was so easy.  Like some of the others, I also used a little more lemon juice because I like it tangier.  Thank you."
59064,65417,2008-06-01,5,This recipe is all about quality ingredients. I was give some fresh organic arugula by my neighbour. Add the local tropical lemons which are actually quite sweet and my best EVOO...YUM!!!!!!!!
180898,65417,2009-07-05,5,"Perfect as is but I added some yummy fresh, diced tomatoes to the mix. I used fresh, home grown arugula which really makes a difference. I really didn't measure anything. I think this would be good with some shaved parmisan cheese or similar hard type cheese over the top (I have to keep it kosher tho). I served this along side my Recipe #356526 which worked well. In fact my youngest daughter enjoyed eating the salad with the meat sauce. I'll make this again and often."
932732,65417,2009-12-07,5,I absolutely LOVE arugula and this is my favorite way to eat it. I add some diced plum tomatoes and a little parmesan on top. I top it with a broiled piece of chicken breast and its a great lunch that I eat every week. Delicious!
440324,65417,2012-06-13,5,I love arugula so this recipe allowed me to enjoy it without overpowering the distinct flavor of these greens. Thank you.
116607,65417,2014-12-14,5,Simple. Perfect. Complements almost any dish. All seasons. I frequently get cravings for this. One of my favourite salads.
1680722,402596,2011-12-09,5,"I will call these Indian Dream! These cookies with cardamom remember me the smell of the Indian sweets. They are really very easy to prepare ande fast done.<br/>I would'nt renouce to the cardamom, but I can imagine that other spices would be very nice too.<br/>Thanks a lot! for This glutenfreee recipe!"
2002101642,402596,2018-04-08,5,"Yum, Yum! Addictive cookies, I consumed the first batch...whew, gotta stop doing that! Add the cardamon, it gives it a pleasant taste."
239229,291004,2009-01-08,5,"I was just coming to post this recipe!! It is divine! I love the Neelys! I don't usually like pecans at all, but I ate it with no problem in this dessert! Thanks for posting! You gotta serve it with Breyer's homestyle vanilla ice cream! Heavenly!"
1361992,291004,2009-09-06,5,This is one dessert that I love to make and eat anytime!  I love it topped with whipped cream but it's even better with French vanilla ice cream!
1244997,291004,2009-11-09,5,"I made this for Sunday dessert using honeycrisp & granny smith apples..YUM!! I followed instruction on this recipe but added freshly ground nutmeg to both the filling & topping. I also used splenda brown sugar..this recipe ROCKS bigtime!
Thanks for sharing KaraRN!"
347822,291004,2009-11-28,5,"Wonderful recipe!!! I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I figured my family and friends would be stuffed from the turkey and sides and not want to eat a very heavy dessert. This recipe was great, small, easy and oh so good. The morning of, I peeled/sliced the apples, drizzled the lemon juice and the maple syrup, mixed/placed them in a container and put them in the fridge. I measured the remaining ingredients and placed them into baggies (except butter and pecans) - 1 - filling, 2 -topping and 3 - crushed pecans.  When it was time to make the recipe, I quickly added the remaining filling ingredients to the apples (made sure to mix well, so there was no flour after taste) and filled 6 (7 - 8 oz) ramekins including the juice from the apples/lemon.  Mixed the topping ingredients and added them to the ramekins.  No need to butter the ramekins.  After baking them, I let them cool a little and added two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream w/ a sprinkle of cinnammon. Thank you for the posting Kara !!! So easy and yummy."
1048246,291004,2009-12-09,5,You could serve this to the queen and it would put a smile on her face!  Very delicious served with real whip cream on top!
296809,122935,2008-06-14,4,"Made for *My 3 Chefs 2008* using a med-heat salsa, I easily reduced this tasty & filling quick-fix to a single serving for my dinner as DH is gone on a fishing trip. I added a generous dollop of sour cream + some chives on top & found my palate welcomed just a bit of the sour cream w/ea bite. I esp like versatile recipes like this & see a pitcher of margaritas, guacamole, a potato bar w/all the fixings on the side + a flan or sopiapillas for dessert making for a great patio party fiesta! Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
1701315,458012,2011-06-15,4,"DH was craving banana bread this morning, but with no time to bake a loaf before he had to be off to work, I thought of this recipe.  I quartered the recipe, using 2 very large, very ripe 'nanners and got about 15 T sized doughnuts.  I rolled them in a mixture of cinnamon, clove and sugar after draining on paper towels, but while still warm.  The flavor is very nice, though I think some cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, vanilla, etc would be nice additions to the batter.  The texture is pretty heavy for a doughnut and they almost seem molten in the middle still once golden on the outside.  If I try these again, I might add a bit more flour and perhaps some baking powder to see if it would lighten them up.  Thanks for a quick substitute for DH's beloved banana bread :)"
1677099,458012,2011-06-16,4,"I appreciated under12parsecs comment about heavy texture.  I added baking powder and mine were not heavy.  I fried them in a cast iron skillet with just a light coating of oil.  They were more flat, thick but flat, not round.  I did this as I don't like deep fat frying mess, patting and I, certainly, don't need the added fat.  Next time I will try in my cast iron abelskiver.....it will make them more round.  I also added cinnamon and allspice to the batter.  Worth doing.....and/or nutmeg, cloves etc.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on a few.  The rest I dipped in mango butter...an apple, pear or other butter would work well.  I will also serve them with chutney on top in the future.  I held back on my instinct to add milk or cream and am glad I did as it would have really changed the result.  Since I have banana trees and frequently looking for something to use them up I will use this again.  My bananas were nice and ripe.  I can imagine that making this with overripe banana would make it sweeter and still nice.  Try it."
330505,139152,2006-09-28,5,"Very good.  I wasn't able to do the cooking today, so DH made this for me.  It was simple and quite tasty - not the dry tasting turkey burger we normally would have - but very moist and with lots of flavor.  Thanks for posting!"
83314,139152,2007-06-20,0,"I'm not going to rate this because I'm not sure if I did something wrong.  I followed this recipe exactly as written, but when I flipped the patties they started falling apart.  I was able to push them back together and when topped with the cheese slice, they held together much better.  Even though the patties were thoroughly cooked, we found the texture to be somewhat mushy which I think was caused by the BBQ sauce being mixed into the meat."
124249,139152,2007-08-31,4,"I usually have trouble getting my beef loving husband to eat turkey meat but he ate this without saying anything. The burgers were moist and had a nice flavor.

Thanks Kana Kahuna.

Bullwinkle"
2000498330,139152,2017-11-10,4,"Pretty good, but could use more seasoning. I added an extra 1/4 t. salt and could have used more. Ground pepper wouldn't hurt either. The texture of the patties was very soft and need to be handled carefully to make sure they don't fall apart, so I cooked in a skillet instead of grilled."
1677099,467132,2011-11-01,5,"I like the tart of the sour cream/lemon against the sweet honey, banana and gentle crunch of the coconut.  I think these would also be good using plain yogurt instead of the sour cream.  They are MESSY.  I cut the banana in round slices.  Next time I think I will cut those in half.  Being smaller I think they will handle easier."
223979,129785,2009-09-15,4,This is like a frittata or quiche.  I sauteed the oinons in the reserve artichoke marinade.  Next time I make this I think I will add a little more bacon and maybe a clove of garlic.  I did not serve this with crackers.  I just cut into small squares and served as is.  Made for the Bargain Basement tag game.
54678,127568,2005-08-08,5,We loved this dish and it was a wonderful way to top off our bbq supper
2459826,127568,2013-02-20,0,Amazing so yummy served this with mint leaves  grated dark choc and Sarah lee  French vanilla ice cream.........best dessert in a long time especially after eating Moroccan lamb strips yum !
353313,170494,2007-01-15,5,"It's the best! I think it goes best with BrownSugar though, so that's what I used. Thanks for posting this recipe! My friend made this at her house a few weeks ago but I couldn't remember how long she microwaved it for."
138550,170494,2007-11-19,4,"Quick and tasty!  I used brown sugar as well, and I was happy for it."
1631509,170494,2014-11-09,5,Excellent and fast!  My mom made this when I was growing up but she cooked the acorn squash in the oven so it took longer.
2001198684,170494,2016-10-18,0,I do this but I use butter and local honey!
2002280886,170494,2018-09-21,5,"Make it as a main dish! Cook the squash (acorn or butternut) until crisp/tender. Allow to cool a bit. In meantime, saute 1/2 onion chopped &amp; 1 large garlic clove chopped for a few minutes. Add 1/4 to 1/2 lb good quality bulk sausage meat. Break up and cook until sausage is cooked through. Put the sausage mixture in a bowl, add 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 2 Tbsp maple syrup (or 1 Tbsp brown sugar &amp; 1 Tbsp honey), salt &amp; pepper to taste. Scrape out squash and add to bowl, leaving about 1/4&quot; on skins to help hold their shape. Mix everything together (an old fashioned potato masher works well), then fill the squash shells with the mix. Top with a little more cheese and cook for another 5 minutes in microwave (or preferably in a pre-heated convection oven @ 350 for 10 minutes or regular oven @ 375 for 15 minutes. YUMMY!"
578177,311959,2008-07-21,4,Another good recipe from SI!  I made two bags and plunked them in the freezer.  This weekend I put one bag in an 8x8 pan and baked.  The texture was dry but the taste was good.  Next time I will bake with a foil cover.
779751,311959,2009-01-20,5,Awesome recipe!  This is one of my favorite baked bean recipes ever.  We served this at my DH's 60th surprise birthday party and it was a huge hit with everyone.  I
1804431,311959,2011-01-31,5,I cant get my hubby to stop eating it!
214565,81168,2005-11-17,5,"Wonderful!  We halved the recipe and used it on six hard rolls, then stuck them under the broiler for a few minutes.  They were great.  Thanks!"
208011,81168,2006-01-18,5,"It worked with garlic powder in a pinch. It's liquid when it's warm and slowly solidifies to a soft butter as it cools. Spice settles in the liquid some, but can be mixed in nicely when it's thick."
72017,81168,2006-03-10,4,"Great butter! Thank you for sharing this easy and tasty treat!
"
369264,81168,2006-11-04,5,WONDERFUL!  Made this up in a jiffy and used on french bread slices tonight!  Thanks a bunch!
181792,81168,2006-12-05,5,Wow this is so good and simple.  I just threw all this together at the last minute and toasted it on some bread.  It was great.  Just enough different from garlic butter to be impressive.
124249,81168,2007-01-18,5,"This easy recipe made a nice topping on our Italian bread. We liked it better than some of the ready made garlic spreads we have tried. I like that it keeps well and you have it when you are in a hurry. 
Will make again.

Thanks Crimsonvixen7

40961,81168,2007-07-12,5,"I made this today and brushed it on The Easiest, Bestest Foccacia Bread Ever!! I put the bread in the oven for 5 minutes and then took it out and put an italian blend of shredded cheese and back in the oven for 5 or 6 more minutes. Wow, this easy recipe for Garlic butter put the Foccacia bread over the top. It tastes like a delicious white pizza. There is enough left to use it again and I can't wait to try it on other foods. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe."
703740,81168,2008-01-22,4,"This tasted really good, but could probably do without the olive oil."
1212910,81168,2009-04-17,5,"This is really good.  I made calzones and brushed this on the inside and outside of the dough. It has a lot of flavor, I can't wait to make garlic bread with it.  Thanks for sharing."

230157,149599,2006-11-29,5,"THIS is comfort food for me and was utterly wonderful! I changed nothing though next time may add just a dash of ground black pepper. A super keeper! Now, HOW am I going to make this in Morocco since I never saw horseradish?? Where there is a will and a crockpot, there is a way! :) Oh yeah no oven there either so I will test this for the crockpot. I am more concerned with the flavor than anything else with this dish. Thank You! :)"
424680,249006,2009-04-24,5,"Oh, yes ~ GREAT, EASY TO MAKE VEGGIE, & this recipe really makes for a wonderfully spruced up asparagus, what with the combo of orange & almond!

315565,226417,2009-08-07,5,This is a soft and yummy cake. I did halve the recipe and made it in a 20 cm cake tin .I used yoghurt instead of buttermilk . In Australia you hardly ever see buttermilk in the supermarket .I served this as advised with fresh fruit . My choice of fruit was fresh pineapple and it was enjoyed by all.Please thank Aunt Mary.
8688,227941,2008-02-06,5,"This is a delightful light sandwich suitable for tea or coffee! I made and directed, using a heart shaped cookie cutter as I did not have an angel cutter the correct size for the slice of bread.  I can see this using any flavor jam you prefer for the holiday or occasion of choice!  For Valentine's Day, use a red raspberry jam  or strawberry with the heart shaped cutter! Absolutely delightful, Lainey6605!!  Thank you so much!"
37449,227941,2008-02-17,5,So yummy! I halved the recipe and used apple jelly. Thanks for a quick breakfast!

383853,227941,2009-09-07,5,Yum.  I loved this simple little sandwich.  I did use raspberry jam instead of the orange marmalade just for person preference but otherwise made as directed.  I love cream cheese so I knew this would be great...it didn't dissapoint!  Thanks for posting!  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag.
26719,92087,2004-07-29,4,"These were very quick and easy to make.  Since my mushrooms were so big, I cut them in half and put them in a ziploc bag.  I cut the marinade in half because I used 2 large mushrooms.  Marinated for a couple hours and baked in the oven for 30 minutes.  I think next time, I will just put the mushrooms in the baking pan and not pour the marinade over it to see if the flavor bakes on.  I will definitely make these again as they went well as a side dish for pasta and a glass of red wine. "
1365025,487428,2012-10-10,5,"Easy recipe to make. It was very good but with the left overs I was thinking why not add some eggs and make it a complete breakfast or nice supper. So after I mixed some of the cheese with the potatoes I then added a scrambled egg to the top and poured the rest of the cheese over it.  Nice hardy breakfast or supper. I already have my next one planned. I'll use some roast beef, add some onions and mushrooms. Made for Pick a Chef."
226863,473396,2012-03-06,5,"I was able to make these in the hour I am allotted for my lunch hour during the week!  So wonderful to have something I can put together and eat during my break.  I did pre-cook the bacon, so I guess I cheated a bit!  Just love arugula, so knew I'd love this.  I may decrease the marinara next time....the thin side of the english muffins got a bit soggy.  Really enjoyed this mini pizza!"
383346,439907,2011-01-04,5,This is great.  I won't buy allspice again.  So easy to do it at home.  I used it in recipe#118666.  Thanks UmmBinat :)  Made for Make my recipe tag game
230983,184633,2006-10-26,3,"This was my first attempt at making or eating any kind of beets.  The first time I made it, I accidentally poured all the sauce on at once and skipped the second baking time.  The second time, I made it correctly.  I enjoyed both, but I think I actually liked the ""incorrect"" attempt better.  On the ""correct"" attempt there wasn't really any sauce left over to serve over the beets; on the ""incorrect"" one there was.  I liked having the sauce over them (and not baked onto the pan)."
107583,184633,2011-10-30,5,Delicious.  Even the non-beet eater liked them.  Great flavors from the honey and balsamic.  Will be making these again.  I steamed the greens and drizzled some of the sauce on them also.  Made for the Think Pink 2011 game.

212609,514038,2014-03-25,5,"Everybody should be able to make a b&eacute;chamel sauce from scratch, as it&#039;s a basis from where so many marvellous dishes start out.&lt;br/&gt;I strongly recommend that you do heat the milk, as it makes it easier to incorporate into the roux ( the flour and butter combo). I also recommend the use of the bay leaf, and if you want to do it like the pro&#039;s, you should heat the milk with a bay leaf studded to a small onion with a clove...it really does make a difference.&lt;br/&gt;I didn&#039;t like the inclusion of the paprika, and in a classic b&eacute;chamel it has no place...sorry Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;As Rosie suggests, you can replace the milk with hot chicken stock, making it a veloute, which is great for chicken pies and suchlike.&lt;br/&gt;I added cheese to my b&eacute;chamel and turned it into a beautiful soft silky cheese sauce, which I tossed some pasta through-just delicious!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Rosie.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR."

243533,136112,2005-09-16,5,I thought it called for too much cheese but made as directed and we all enjoyed it immensely.  Don't have Brie often and that was a ncie addition to the asparagus.
240832,136112,2005-09-18,4,Made it exactly as directed. Might cut back just slightly on the amount of cheese (just a bit too much) but the overall taste was great. Great Sunday dinner addition!
199848,136112,2013-04-16,4,"Really cheesy and good.  Almost too much cheese as written, though (maybe a typo?).  I used 6 oz of each of the cheeses listed and that was plenty.   I only cooked the asparagus for 3 - 4 minutes before placing in the oven.  Ten minutes would make the asparagus too soft and mushy.   Thanx for posting this!"
468351,497150,2013-11-09,5,"Quaker has changed their oatmeal cookie recipe over the years, which all have been pretty good!  I like this one!  It is a keeper. It is simple, delicious, and most importantly to DHs liking.  :) The only change I made was; instead of using all butter in the recipe, the full 7/8s cup of butter, I used &frac12; cup unsalted butter (1 stick) plus 6 tablespoons of buttered flavored Crisco.  A perfectly delicious cookie!"

16510,4395,2007-09-02,5,Yea...this tastes just like my favorite Bacon Horseradish dip from Breakstone's that was discontinued years ago! We've made it with both bacon and Hormel bacon bits. We much prefer the Hormel because it gives it the exact flavor and texture of Breakstone's. Thanks for sharing.
461724,4395,2008-10-16,4,Great dip for horseradish lovers!  Made for 2008 All New Zaar Cookbooks Tag.
128961,4395,2009-06-30,5,"Fantastic!  I had never bought the store bought version so now I know what I had been missing.  In fact, I think I am addicted!"
1409947,4395,2010-04-06,5,"As I'm Australian, I have never come across this dip variety for purchase here.  I think horseradish is divine.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, one problem though - I'm the only one in my household who likes horseradish.  Oh well, the perils of eating it all by myself!"
1795748,4395,2011-03-29,4,"This dip brings back yummy childhood memories.   I remember my mom buying bacon horseradish dip at the grocery store and then one day the stores didn't have it anymore.  We were so sad.  I am so glad to have this dip now.  Thanks, Ruth!"
296809,170567,2006-09-20,4,"My Quisine Queen team-mates know I have a spec fondness for the lime flavour, so all things OJ or lemon-based usually end up w/a lime version. I did it again here & used lime juice lightly sweetened w/powd sugar to dip the banana slices. Then I finished the prep as written & enjoyed the outcome atop a warmed flour tortilla. The recipe's So Amer origin seemed to invite my version & it was so good - a perfect light dessert for a SW or Tex-Mex meal. Pls see my rating system - a very worthy 4 stars for sure! Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
344231,170567,2007-07-03,5,EVERYONE said this is a 5 STAR recipe!!! WE LOVED IT!!! (:
246482,170567,2007-07-09,5,Wonderful dessert and I forgot the sour cream until I finished it.Hubby Licked the bowl lol.
311003,170567,2007-11-07,4,"Wow!  I'd never tried cooking bananas before -- the sauce was fantastic, and we loved them.  The kids preferred them without the sour cream, though, but my husband and I liked it just as was written.  Thanks!"
466212,170567,2008-01-05,4,This was pretty good.  It almost tasted like fried plantaines.  I really liked it with the sour cream too.
382071,170567,2008-11-02,4,"LOVELY! I know I like bananas, oj, butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together. I also know I like sour cream and limes together. And when combined they make a delightful exotic pair. I used little manzano bananas. Next time I might add some lime zest to the sour cream. Made for the Zaar Stars tag game."
526666,170567,2011-03-24,5,"YUM! These were really good, and different than I expected!  I took a little 'poetic license' and instead of the sour cream, I served this topped by recipe#431655, which I thought would pair well. I was right! I will try this again, and use sour cream next time. Thanks for sharing, Bayhill!"
309630,170567,2012-10-27,4,Yum!!!  These are just delicious.  I did change it up a little instead of sour cream I used vanilla yogurt.  Really added a pop of flavor.  May for Football Poll 12 week 7
27385,18861,2002-02-10,4,this was pretty good-had a different taste than the falafels that i am used to i think it was the wheat germ-but it was tasty i added cuim and used fresh garlic. thanks for yet another great recipe!!
12657,18861,2002-06-14,4,"Really good, though I haven't tasted falafels before, so I wouldn't know how close this comes to the real thing. The only thing I changed was in using dried parsley instead of fresh. Next time I'll try some cumin and maybe some more pepper. I flattened the balls a little into pudgy little patties before baking because I wanted to use them in pita pockets. I had a great dinner with a pita pocked lined with hummus and one of these falafels resting inside! Thanks Lennie! :-)"
467707,18861,2007-03-18,4,"This was great! I added ground corriander, and extra pepper.  I also baked these in a mini muffin tin with a light spray of cooking oil, and brushed the tops with a little olive oil.  I now have a freezer bag full for quick lunch prep."
494084,18861,2007-08-09,4,This was quite good but didn't taste at all like falafel to me.  Tasted much more like a chick pea burger.
1609858,18861,2014-02-04,3,"Never had falafels before, but these seemed pretty good."
393426,274746,2008-01-04,4,This was pretty good.  I substituted a few thin-sliced onions for the cheese.  The only thing I would say is that it definitely took the pototato longer than 1:30 to cook.  I think i ended up cooking mine for about 3:30.
369715,274746,2012-09-25,3,I used four red potatoes and doubled the rest of the ingredients. These were good but real greasy. I would cut the oil in half next time. Mine also took a lot longer to cook. I had to cook mine for fifteen minutes. I topped it with some cheddar cheese which added to the grease too but they tasted good.
542159,439789,2013-02-09,4,"Life does not get any easier or healthier than these succulent potatoes! DH asked that I mention that the olive oil, herb and sweet potato juice that collects in the foil is well worth taking a spoon to. Thanks for the post."
37449,415952,2010-03-21,5,"Excellent smoothie! I love berries and used frozen ones, but a fresh banana. Thanks so much Syd! Made for your win in the Asian game in Newest Zaar tag!"
993604,415952,2010-04-21,5,Yum!  I enjoyed this for breakfast.  I used a fresh banana and frozen berries.  Made for PRMR.
369715,415952,2010-04-29,5,My son and I enjoyed this for breakfast this morning. I made it exactly as written using a fresh banana and the rest of the ingredients were frozen.
171790,415952,2010-06-03,5,"Yum. Very good! I used an orange, strawberry, banana blend juice, a fresh banana and frozen berries. Thanks for a delicious breakfast. Made for Veggie Swap 23."
168462,415952,2010-07-07,5,I love smoothies because they are so easy to make and refreshing. It is 93 F here today and this really helped cool us down. I love the fact it is not too sweet either. I used fresh strawberries and banana and the rest of the berries were frozen.Thanks for the recipe.
593927,415952,2010-07-13,5,"This tastes good. I liked the note about not using all frozen! I used Europe's best field berry mix with extra strawberries from a strawberry package of the same brand. I used a pretty unsweet orange juice from Allen's (DD, toddlers juice box) and the banana. Not properly food combined as per http://www.momssoapbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/food_combining.jpg."
632249,415952,2011-11-01,5,I made this for my daughter after she got her braces tightened this morning. Her teeth will be aching for days so it's nice to have a simple smoothie to fill her up. I used frozen berriest but fresh bananas.  Thx Syd!
1052065,368320,2009-06-22,5,I considered this a low calorie elephant ear. I love dutch baby and adding the extra butter with cinnamon sugar made it super yummy and lots of fun. Thanks for posting 2hot!!!
1409093,368320,2010-05-05,4,"This is a nice and easy to make breakfast, but I actually thought that it lacked salt."
189616,368320,2010-05-08,4,"My eldest DS hates eggs (or so he says) my yDS  likes eggs. My yDS's comment afer the first bite asked me if it was an omlet..My eDS devored it! I don't care for sweets myself, but it does taste more like an egg puff pastry rather than a 'dough boy"" But than considering this recipe does include 4 eggs that should be understood. Would I make it again-YES! I found recipes here that called for either frozen dough. or refrigerated biscuits that are deep fried. I love my boys and it was a great healthy alternative."
305531,20133,2009-10-16,5,Yum! This was so simple and so good. Thanks Allecia for a nice new keeper. Made for Chef Alphabet Soup tag.
424680,357941,2009-09-17,5,"Being the chocoholic that I am, there was no way I'd make just 1 1/2 cups of a sauce like this, so I made 3 batches, just so I'd have enough to perhaps share with someone else (but not necessarily)! I'd recently been given a 2-pound block of El Rey Venezuelan Dark Chocolate 73 & used half of that for this recipe, along with whipping cream, some light honey & unsalted butter, all making for A REALLY WONDERFUL TASSTING SAUCE! We are stingy with our portions, however, so in our home, that will last us a while! One think I couldn't decide, though, was whether to keep it in the frig or in the safe!! Thanks for sharing a great recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adopteed in the current Pick A Chef]"
364685,271186,2009-12-27,5,The basics are always best. Thanks!
383346,502306,2013-07-02,5,I basted the pork tenderloin from the beginning on the grill.  I wanted it to taste enough lol  It was yummy.  My son also liked it.  Thanks Elizabeth :)  Made for Market tag game
135566,230940,2012-10-08,5,Very easy to make and a yummy dip.  The amount of sugar makes it very sweet and I  recommend serving with tart apples. I used 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Made for Fall 2012 Pick A Chef.
461834,230940,2013-04-10,5,"Delicious and a bit healthier using the light cream cheese!!!  I made 1/4 of the amount, just sprinkled in the cinnamon to what I thought I would like and the only change I made was to use 1/2 of the amount of brown sugar.  It was still very sweet, enough for my tastes, and was wonderful with sliced Granny Smith Apples.  I love that it uses ingredients that I normally have on hand!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for one of my adopted chefs for PAC Spring 2013."
26041,43350,2003-01-07,5,"So different and SO GOOD!!!  I made a batch of these this morning to take to my doctors office (butter them up a bit) and the bacth is now minus 3 :-) I will have to make these for DH this weekend, he lived in New Orleans.  Thanks Riff, these are a keeper!"
26546,43350,2003-01-11,5,These are absolutely wonderful!  My husband ate one & raved about them.  Something different and easy to make.
64178,43350,2003-01-18,5,"I made these last weekend for company and they are so good, I am making some more today. Not like your usual Brownie, but good non the less.
Very easy to make, I noticed I had to cook it just a little longer than the recipe said to make sure cream cheese set."
62747,43350,2003-01-29,5,these are very good and great tasting---very rich tasting! I had to bake a little longer!!
84439,43350,2003-05-02,4,"My wife made these-she said they are very easy to make so that's a plus.  The best thing about them is the cream cheese/cake mix texture variation, which you don't normally get with the standard one-texture brownies.   "
65618,43350,2003-06-02,4,"These were very good, but I found the topping to be a little too sweet, so next time I will cut back on the powdered sugar.  After reading other reviews on how long they seemed to take to bake, I tried making them in a jelly roll pan.  It worked great and I also was able to get a few more cuts out of the pan.  The house I cook for is filled with chocolate fanatics, therefore I tried pressing some chocolate chips in part of the pan.  I would do this again, the ladies loved them!"
95217,43350,2004-02-02,5,I made these for the teen group from church last night.  We had 12 teens and 15 adults.  Everyone raved about this dessert.  I thought the topping was a little sweet but everyone else said it was great the way it was.  I will make them again. 
42337,43350,2004-08-04,5,"I love that this recipe is so simple and tastes so good.  Judging by the fact that my son and his friends are swarming around the pan and I'm fighting to get one that speaks for itself.  They are good & sweet.  This would be a great recipe for a showers, and christenings.  "
74342,43350,2004-08-12,0,These sort of remind me of gooey butter cake.  I used about 3/4 of the powdered sugar and found that to be plenty.
104891,43350,2006-05-31,4,"My BF loved these!  I thought they were pretty good, a little on the sweet side.  When I make them again, I will use less sugar as advised in other posts.  "
252816,43350,2010-05-02,5,"I found these  bars,very tasty.I did cut powder sugar by  3/4 cup. Was sweet enough for my family. A great potluck item..Thank U..UPDATE: I make these brownies now using a pecan cake mix and add 1 extra egg to the cream cheese topping. Also  use only 2 cups of powder sugar...UMmm Good.."
1701315,43350,2011-07-28,5,"Boy oh boy are these ever good!  The bottom layer is almost blondie-like in its chewiness and the nuts are a wonderful crunchy surprise.  The top layer is creamy, verging on cheesecake.  Yum.  I could also see adding fruit, zest, or spices to either layer, but they are wonderful as is!"
2323227,43350,2012-07-09,5,"These are incredible. I made them using a Lemon Supreme cake mix, because it's all I had. Oh my word. Delicious. Highly recommended."
2624643,43350,2013-01-09,2,"These were very disappointing. I cut the sugar back to 2 cups like was suggested so I dont know if that affected the texture or what..but the top was way too sticky and pasty, glue-like. And the bottom crust was dry and crumbling apart, they were a disaster to cut and eat. My 12 yr old who loves ALL sweets didnt even like them :("
2824629,43350,2013-05-13,5,"I made these tonight and they were so gooood !! I used banana cake mix, reduced the amount of powdered sugar and baked for an hour !! OMG so yummy."
95772,43350,2016-02-17,5,These are DE. LISH. OUS!!!  The only changes I made was using 12 ounces of cream cheese and I added about a cup of Rice Krispies to the cream cheese mixture.  It was so SIMPLE and the flavor is out of this world.  This will be my new &quot;go to&quot; desert recipe.  Thank you!!!!
2001940384,43350,2018-01-18,5,I used a chocolate cake mix!!! It is the bomb!!!
2002062967,43350,2018-03-27,3,"These are good; basically a Chess Bar, really. Funny how things end up with different names, lol!"
1911882,496213,2013-05-10,5,I had to try these! these were honestly pretty good! I did use apple cinnamon instant oatmeal added some chopped pecans. for only having two ingredients these defiantly helped my craving for a cookie...lol without the guilt! I will make these again!
2882644,496213,2013-06-29,4,"As a diabetic this recipe really intrigued me.  I must say it exceeded my expectations.   I like my cookies a little sweeter, so I will add a little Splenda or (pure/organic) honey to sweeten them up.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I give them 4.5 stars, but the real test will come when my grandkids try them."
1802849661,496213,2015-08-31,5,Great recipe and so simple to make! Perfect for snacks or breakfast on the go!
1802738659,496213,2015-11-11,4,"These should not be considered &quot;cookies&quot;. Really, this recipe should be called &quot;build your own energy bar/snack recipe&quot;. I&#039;ll make this again, but probably as a bar, and with more add ins. As-is, it&#039;s very gummy, and a little bland...and I added peanut butter and sugar on top! It&#039;s all good as long as you&#039;re not expecting this to be a cookie or a dessert. Still, it was easy and fine for my tastes."
2001744935,496213,2018-03-09,5,"Loved these ... and I love good health ... and easy things ... made these smaller, added cinnamon. Made in my toaster oven. Deliciously easy and plain."
859074,359334,2013-11-24,4,so easy and impressive
42720,111229,2005-05-29,5,Great marinade!  I used it for pork chops and marinated them for about 4 hours then cooked them on the grill.  Really helped to keep them moist and we loved the cumin flavor.  I can't wait to try this on chicken fajitas or chicken kabobs.  
437246,111229,2007-02-07,5,"I use this all the time for beef fajitas.  I've found that overnight is too long for either skirt steak (preferred if you can find it) or flank steak.  I usually make it the night before and put the meat in the next morning for a lunch buffet.  About six hours for flank and four hours for skirt is all you want to go, otherwise the meat starts to get chalky."
204024,111229,2007-12-23,4,This is good and easy to make. I marinated about 8 hrs. Made for Holiday Tag 2007
254614,111229,2007-12-25,4,"This is a combination of a Spanish marinade and an Oriental marinade.
plus the title ""Black Water Marinade"", this is different and it
it will grow on you. For darn sure it makes tough meat...tender. Thanks for posting!"
128473,51982,2004-05-23,5,"These cookies were so light, tender and tasty. I substituted walnuts for coarsly chopped almonds. They tasted wonderful. Thank you for posting this great recipe Carrie. Its a keeper."
25792,51982,2003-03-14,5,"Carrie, these are very good, only subbed pecans for the walnuts. A definate make again recipe!TY"
523796,184935,2007-09-16,4,"We omitted the salsa because DH does not like tomatoes.  He thought it needed a little bit more ""kick"", so he added some hot sauce.  He thought it was really easy to make and definitely a ""keeper"" recipe.  Thanks!"
141293,261714,2007-11-11,4,"A quick easy weekend breakfast.  I reduced the amount of servings to two and made in an 8"" skillet.  Used two slices of bacon and ff sour cream and milk.  Served with croissants, avocado and apple slices."
96177,261714,2008-10-14,5,"Made this this morning, quick and very good. Used sharp cheese, think next time I'll try swiss or pepper jack, just for fun. Made for 123 tag."
166642,261714,2008-11-21,4,"Yummy casserole with great flavor! I halved this recipe and baked it in an oval baker. Mine had to bake about 45 minutes. Even though I halved the recipe, I still used 4 slices bacon and I'm glad I did. I think I would add a couple more slices if I were to make the recipe to serve 8. Thanks for sharing!"
54678,125263,2005-06-13,5,"Very good, I quadrupled the ingredients to serve at family bbq and it was a hit for simplicity and flavor. I am always trying to find recipes that have chives since my many gardens have a lot of chive plants growing."
47892,125263,2006-10-07,5,"I love this rice dish! I have the exact recipe in my recipe file and have had it for years. I cook plain rice in a rice cooker then add all the ingredients. Used fresh chives from the garden, too! The only difference is I use half the amount of Worcestershire then reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon. Great comfort food! Thanks for sharing the recipe with us. cg ;)"
117781,32486,2005-04-10,5,"As big fans of a thicker, dense pancake this recipe was a winner for us! These were tasty, super healthy and filling pancakes.  I used Hodgson Mill Buckwheat pancake mix and added a couple tablespoons of ground walnuts and almonds. I also substituted lowfat buttermilk for half of the skim milk.  The banana and cinnamon are a lovely highlight to the flavor and are not overpowering.  I had mine spread with Smart Balance and hubby spread his with a little natural peanut butter. We both topped ours off with Sugar free maple syrup served along side fresh fruit which made for a delicious and South Beach friendly breakfast. I did find the batter needs a pinch of salt after tasting the first pancake, so we added it to the rest of the batter.  Do not try this recipe if you like a light fluffy or eggy pancake, but if you want a substantial more dense and tall pancake that will fill you up and is good for you, this is it!!"
1055699,32486,2009-02-09,4,"This is a great, filling, and healthy pancake!! I omitted the eggs( there was enough moisture). I used unprocessed bran instead of wheat germ and reduced the baking mix to 2/3 cup. Then I just used cooking spray not butter to cook. It was soo filling that we didn't eat anything till late that night. Thanks for a ""good for you"" pancake recipe."
80560,20238,2003-04-14,5,"Very easy to make if you know how to separate eggs and beat egg whites. Fortunately, I do :) My wife and I ate the whole souffle for dinner by ourselves."
117781,20238,2004-05-28,0,"Honestly, this souffle is absolutely delicious.  Although, the ingredients make a fantastic dish, the instructions need a bit of work.  If a person had never made a souffle before, this recipe would be a disaster. It needs to be clear that the egg whites need to be whipped in a separate bowl to a stiff peak and that the yolks should be whisked together in a larger, separate bowl to allow room for incorporating the cheese sauce and egg whites.  To avoid scorching the cheese sauce, it needs to be stated that the butter should be melted over medium heat before adding the flour and that the flour should be whisked in thoroughly with the butter. I did not let the butter/flour mixture cook very long before adding milk that I had warmed in the microwave which helps avoid the lumps you get if you add cold milk.  If you incorporate the milk in small batches and whisk thoroughly each time, it yields the smooth sauce necessary for a souffle.  There is no mention when to add the salt, so I added it into the cheese sauce mixture along with fresh ground pepper and a pinch of garlic powder.  Before adding the sauce to the eggs, they need to be tempered so as not to scramble them. I whisked about a 1/8 cup of the warm cheese sauce into the egg yolks to temper, before whisking in the rest of the sauce. The egg whites should be folded in very gently in two batches so as not to lose the air you have just incorporated.  Also, to get a tall souffle that does not spill over the sides, take a strip of foil and butter it. Wrap the foil around the souffle dish (butter side on the inside) like a collar that will stand a good 6 inches or so above the souffle dish. This really did take exactly 30 minutes to bake. The urge to open the door and check it should be resisted so as not to have the souffle fall too early on.  It comes out beautifully and it is absolutely delicious, with a nice cheese flavor in each fluffy bite. It melts in your mouth and is just wonderful.  I sprinkled with chives before serving. Imagine my surprise when my picky 2 year old wanted to try it and ended up eating more than I did.  With these instructions added to the recipe, I would rate this 5 stars!"
59064,20238,2005-08-06,5,"This was my first ever attempt at any kind of souffle because it seemed perfect for a quick dinner in front of the TV with the kids.
It is very easy to prepare as long as you assume that the egg whites need to be well beaten. I didn't temper the eggs with the sauce and got away with it as I move fast! I have a small convection oven so I went for 23 minutes and then left the souffles in the oven for another 5 minutes."
99325,20238,2006-05-22,4,This is a good basic recipe. I can't wait to vary it!
9869,5174,2001-07-23,5,"Didn't know what sort of olives to use...so I used black olives...really tasty...thanks Bill.  =) I thought at the time it must mean green olives...I had none...and am a sucker for black ones anyway....didnt use many....will try it again with green....love this type of recipe.
"
1634,5174,2001-07-25,0,"This recipe comes from Marsha Adams, who hosted a program on American Public Broadcasting stations called Quilt Country. The first time I tried it, I knew it was worthy of lots of stars. I use those Spanish green olives that are stuffed with pimentos, because it adds some nice color.Since the recipe calls for diced, I save a little money by using the ones that come sliced in the jar because they are made from olives that are not perfect enough to be sold whole."
12545,5174,2001-08-06,5,"My kids loved this, even my daughter who doesn't care for tuna salad.  I substituted chopped celery for nuts.  Great to have on hand to make sandwiches for a quick lunch."
30716,5174,2002-02-27,5,"I had this spread on toast and it was fantastic!
My husband wasn't crazy about it (doesn't like olives) but that just meant more for me! Thanks, I will be making this again."
110125,5174,2003-12-22,5,I really liked this recipe--couldn't stop eating it.  I used green olives with pimentos.  Actually used an extra quarter cup of olives to give it a little more zing!
134663,5174,2004-06-01,5,Fabulous! I confess that I am tuna junkie and can eat most anything if is mixed with tuna. This recipe is a slice of heaven! I used manzanilla olives stuffed with pimentos and sliced almonds and served with Ritz buttery crackers. I can't wait to make another batch! Thank you so much!
146884,5174,2004-07-30,5,"This was pretty good.  I admit I was skeptical about the tuna and cream cheese combo, but it turned out well.  The kids and I ate it for lunch on regular white bread.  I decreased the amounts, though, for just hte three of us.  1 can of tuna, 3 T of lite cream cheese, 2 med green pimento olives, chopped, 2 T lite mayo, 2 T lemon juice, and 1 T chopped walnuts with black pepper to taste.  I'm not tuna's number one fan, but I can see making this at least once a week for a healthy lunch with a glass of milk and a side of fruit."
37183,5174,2005-05-18,5,"I made this several months ago and just realized I hadn't reviewed it when I came looking for the recipe to recommend it to someone. Sorry! I made it with black olives, and spread it on flour tortillas & sliced 'em into spirals. Garnished with sliced black olives. Very good! Next time I'll try with green olives, as we love those too!"
231444,5174,2005-09-05,5,"I spread these on tortillas and made pinwheels out of them for our lunch today. My friends were very appreciative of this. I just only added some green onion, that's it. Absolutely delicious."
302112,5174,2006-04-11,5,A wonderful little dish!  my son loves it!  We used it on tortilla shells and round crackers.  I definately will add this to my cheese ball snacking!  wonderful recipe 
112489,5174,2006-07-14,5,This was wonderful!  I used chicken that I made fresh instead of tuna since I don't eat fish or any kind of canned meat.  I doubled the recipe and used 10 Mission brand burrito size tortillas for pinwheel sandwiches. Eveyone lovedd the nuts in them.  I did add about 4 ozs more of cream chease just to make them creamier.  These were so quick and easy for a large party.  I was still being asked about them a week later.  I will definately make them again for entertaning or for just at home.
137838,5174,2006-09-18,5,"This is great!!!  I used only 2 T mayo and 1/2 c almonds.  Unfortunately I had no olives but it was still awesome.  Some people had on bread, some on crackers.  Everyone loved it.  I will make again and this time I will remember the olives!!"
68715,5174,2007-05-13,5,I made this for my 7 year old ds son who loves olives and tuna. He really like the flavour.
394077,5174,2007-08-26,0,I am not going to give this any stars because it could be just my personal taste and not the fault of the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but I am not too crazy about the flavor.  It is super rich and I can only taste the mayo.
69260,5174,2008-01-22,2,"I made this ""as is"" with black olives. Before I added the walnuts, I thought this is really tasty. I wish I would have subed the walnuts for onions. As is, this is just OK. The walnuts just don't fit for me. Sorry."
649885,5174,2008-09-18,2,"I made this with green olives.  I wasn't impressed.  There are a lot of better appetizers that are quick, easy and taste better.  My guests also didn't enjoy this (only one thought it was really good).  Sorry, but I won't be making this again."
1633270,5174,2010-07-21,5,Oh my gosh!  I've been looking for this recipe for years!!!  When I was  child I lived in north western Pennsylvania. We lived out in the country and just down the road was an Amish family. The kids there were the only ones within walking distance so I spend a great deal of time there playing in the summers. Almost every day at lunch their mother would serve a spread very similar to this on homemade bread with fresh apples from their orchard.  The best lunches ever!!!
978876,5174,2011-06-01,0,"I've decided not to give this one any stars because honestly, I'm really not sure about this one.  I was looking for something new to do with tuna and found this saved in one of my cookbooks.  I've frequently added green olives to tuna salad before and thought I would like this as a change.  I really can't say that I disliked this recipe, just that it was really different.  The cream cheese makes it really rich for me.  Even DH said the same when he tasted it, ""Different"".  I think we're still pondering this one.  I'll probably try this one again, with a few tweaks, because for some reason I'm really drawn to this and really want to ""like"" it. :)"
689750,135051,2008-04-04,1,"i did this recipe 3 times till now and it failed completely each time, the banana chips turn out to be soggy and won't take it shape, may be it is something i do wrong"
200862,231004,2014-04-13,3,"Made for PAC 2014. An interesting concept and an original use for leftover pork belly (from which I made pulled pork first). But we did find the sauce somewhat overpowering over a garden salad. Nice and different, but a little strong. Thanks for posting this interesting recipe."
384918,438674,2014-01-17,5,"My first try at making creeps, and these were quite good. I tried using Pam to oil skillet, and that didn&#039;t work real well.  I didn&#039;t see where the tapioca starch was to be mixed in, so I just put it with the other dry ingredients.  My batter was lumpy but the creeps were still good,"
2000916330,438674,2017-02-03,5,"These are excellent crepes! I added a bit more milk than the recipe called for, however. I found the batter was too thick for crepes with only 1 1/4 cups of milk, so I added 1 1/2 cups + 2 tbsp of milk and it was perfect. This will be my go-to recipe for crepes now."
254614,164100,2006-04-13,0,This is mine kind of recipe. Can hardly wait to try.
1728307,33954,2010-11-12,0,I really liked this recipe.....VERY simple and Very few ingredients which of course is awesome when you are hurrying and don't have many groceries on hand!!!  The only thing that I did differently from the recipe is used chicken broth instead of water!  Delicious....Thanks for the submission of this recipe!!!
2158567,33954,2012-01-23,0,"I was not in a hurry while making this so I browned the chicken first.  Probably didn't make a difference in taste but sure was pretty.  The recipe, with chicken broth instead of water as noted by another reviewer, was a wonderful touch.   I am keeping this recipe and sure to put in in the rotation. YUM!"
2001303066,530270,2017-02-27,5,"Another amazing recipe by Tom G, it's great to be able to enjoy the cheat foods and still being fairly healthy."
198971,429838,2011-02-27,5,"Excellent taste from a really simple recipe! I wasn't sure how the dried oregano would taste (we usually use fresh), but it turned out to be great. I think using butter to brown the onion, and adding the olive oil and basil only at the end makes a surprisingly good difference."
529571,429838,2011-09-25,0,"Great, simple, EASY sauce. I've been looking for a good simple, quick sauce for what feels like years and this is it! America's Test Kitchen never disappoints."
2689893,429838,2013-02-12,4,This is definitely a good recipe. Very easy too.<br/><br/>Try adding a splash of Burgundy wine after adding the tomatoes or white wine just before you add the tomatoes!
2906339,429838,2013-07-18,5,"I make this every time I make something that calls for tomato sauce and it is phenomenal. Just tart enough, just salty and flavorful enough. Amazing!"
2912533,429838,2013-07-22,5,"This is my new go-to recipe for pasta or pizza sauce. For decades I&#039;ve been using a recipe that relies on tomato paste, which meant that as long as I had a can in my pantry I could make a red sauce, but today all I had was crushed tomatoes. Boy, was that a good thing! My whole family agrees that this is a GREAT recipe, especially with the 2 T of fresh basil (which grow in a pot on my window sill year-round). I appreciated the note about the science behind the instructions and ingredients; it sure makes a difference. Make this! You&#039;ll be glad you did!"
185142,429838,2013-12-24,5,"So easy &amp; delicious! I used 1 tsp dried basil instead of fresh because I had none. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I served it over homemade pasta"
241385,429838,2014-01-05,5,"Made this in a pinch when I was out of store bought sauce.  Truly just 10 mins to make, easy and absolutely delicious!!! I did few variations, I added a handful of peppers I had on hand, used Muir Glen whole plum tomatoes (used immersion blender) and I like a really seasoned sauce so added a little extra seasoning. I will for sure be making this again!!!!"
1802704192,429838,2014-04-29,5,Quick and easy recipe I came across after discovering I was out of jarred pasta sauce.  No more pasta sauce for our kitchen.  This is my new &quot;go-to&quot; recipe for pasta sauce.
1802776261,429838,2014-05-27,5,Love love love this sauce. My daughter recently went vegetarian and is always wanting spaghetti. I don&#039;t care for the jarred sauce myself but still needed something quick and easy to throw together for her. This is it. Definitely a keeper.
1802887113,429838,2014-07-04,2,"I&#039;m experimenting with different sauce recipes to find &quot;the one&quot; that works best. This definitely registered as more of a sweet sauce for me. Maybe I was tempted to try this out since I was breaking a cardinal rule I&#039;ve heard from my significant other&#039;s Neapolitan mother: never, ever cook onions and garlic together!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After breaking said rule and risking my life, I have to say I agree. The carmelized onions add a sweetness to the sauce that seems to register well with American palates. I wouldn&#039;t say this felt as sweet as, say, Papa John&#039;s pizza sauce, but nevertheless makes me want to try a nice red sauce with just a lot of delicious crushed garlic instead. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise, I think the suggested portions of spices worked out fine. I only added a pinch of brown sugar. Oh, and I felt this recipe was missing black pepper and added about a teaspoon or so."
2288695,429838,2014-10-29,5,I made this because I had no tomato sauce in the house but plenty of Muir Glen diced tomatoes.  This was so good I may never buy tomato sauce again.  The extra effort was worth it.
11154472,429838,2014-12-04,5,"I just made this a few minutes ago, I had no bottled sauce in the house.  I&#039;ve been meaning to make it, and my son just tasted it and then ate it straight up from a mug.  I will make this again,  and probably add a little wine as another cook suggested.  I used my imersion blender to smooth it out a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrific recipe."
1803540083,429838,2014-12-22,5,This was very quick and tastey. I added a can of red pepper diced Tamatoes to it as well because I like my sauce with more spice. I also added hot Italian sausage while saut
427184,429838,2014-12-28,5,"MUCH better then canned sauce. This will be a staple, thank you!"
2000449926,429838,2015-09-03,5,So yummy and easy! Added tomato paste and a bit more sugar but will be using this recipe again in the future
2000800890,429838,2016-01-05,5,"I first saw this on one of their cooking shows on making Chicken Parm. The sauce is a perfect balance, not too acidic, and SO easy to make! I learned that it really does come down to the canned tomatoes you use. My sauces before were always too watery. The bottled sauce we had been using had 7g of sugar to a 1/2 cup! So worth it to make your own! If you have a chance check out their Chicken Parm recipe - it&#039;s the best! (I sub eggplant for chicken.)"
2000819755,429838,2016-01-15,5,"Very easy, simple and delicious. I made sure to add the salt and pepper to taste."
2000821130,429838,2016-01-16,5,"Changes: did not have basil, used a generous sprinkle of dried Italian seasoning. Cook onion/garlic until very brown, simmer for at least 30-45 minutes. Follow directions!! This is imperative for the flavored to develop. My husband said, &quot;this is the best sauce I have ever eaten, WAY better than my mom&#039;s and I thought hers was the best!&quot;"
2155453,429838,2016-02-05,4,"Good recipe! I made a few changes to give it a little more flavor to my family&#039;s liking. Changes made include ... I followed the cooking instructions as given, added a few ingredients along the way. To the dry ingredients, in addition to oregano and salt, I also added 1/4 tsp tarragon, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and a pinch of black pepper.  I used organic crushed tomatoes w/ basil and instead of sugar I used 1/4 tsp of Sweetleaf (a natural zero calorie, zero carbs, zero glycemic response sweetener from stevia plant). After adding the crushed tomatoes and Sweetleaf to the sauce pan I added 1 TBSP of Marsala cooking wine. Bring to a rolling simmer, add 1/8 tsp baking soda, reduce heat to a very low simmer - cook for 30 min."
2000950147,429838,2016-03-30,5,"One of the fastest and easiest recipes I&#039;ve tried. My father had stopped by briefly on his way home from work and had one small bite at my insistence. As a result, he requested to take some back with him!"
2001281861,429838,2016-12-04,0,"Awesome sauce and so easy to make. I made 2 changes- I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. 2 I left out the sugar and used baking soda to neutralize the acid, making it taste sweeter. You don't need much, I used about an 1/8 tsp, maybe a little less."
2001540917,429838,2017-05-16,5,Love this recipe as did my family. Quick. Easy and so tasty. Made one little change used brown sugar instead of white. Delicious. Sharing this recipe!
2001486911,429838,2017-10-20,0,Can you can this pasta sauce Thank You Lynda Christian
2001801544,429838,2017-11-24,5,"I LOVE this sauce and use it every time I need tomato sauce. Works very well as a pizza sauce too! We ate it about every week.... So easy and quick and just soooooo delicious!! You can imagine that it tastes even better the next day, but delicious right away too. I usually add extra basil and garlic because that's just my preference. Using Muir Glen's organic crushed tomatoes really makes a huge difference!"
2001953552,429838,2018-01-25,0,Great recipe. Easy and best of all taste mmm good!!!
1527385,429838,2018-07-14,4,Good and zesty! Not bland like jarred pasta sauces. I added browned and seasoned ground turkey because I like a meaty sauce .
2002305063,429838,2018-10-27,0,"I used good can tomatoes, slice fresh garlic using a razor blade, if you like garlic try this. Excellent flavor."
25792,71922,2004-09-11,5,Sharon love this recipe!  Used gingergold apples and processed in jars.  Did keep enough out for a small apples crisp and its already been devoured!  Making more tomorrow for the winter.  Thanks!
328099,71922,2007-11-10,5,Oh my goodness--what a great way to use apples.  Tried this the first time and it was so-o-o easy.  I could not believe how quickly the apple mixture thickened.  I canned it and have already used 1 quart for a pie.  What fabulous flavor.  Thought I had just picked the apples from the tree.  Thank you.
43986,71922,2008-01-13,5,I make this recipe all the time. It makes the best pie ever.
96177,71922,2008-10-07,5,Outstanding! Made into a pie. Next apple picking will be made into canned filling. Made for the photo tag game.
357358,202316,2007-01-07,3,"This makes a nice sandwich and you won't feel deprived. If, like me, you cannot use much EVOO, try grapeseed oil. I suspect that a few shakes of garlic powder would go well and maybe some onion powder. Thanks Sharon."
74558,202316,2007-02-21,5,"Avocado-Mayonnaise is what it is.  My love of avocado and mayonnaise, individually and now in combination makes this recipe a shoe-in for repeats.  Thanks again, Sharon 123"
102526,202316,2007-06-28,5,"This was good.  I had to make at the very last minute for zwt 3 and my blender was dirty, so used my hand mixer.  It still turned out good, although more runny and oily than I would like it.  I would reduce the oil slightly next time.  I ate it on a piece of bread just to taste and I can see it being really good on a sandwich or pita sandwich or wrap.  I will definitely use the rest up."
717221,202316,2008-05-20,5,"Thank you! I recently posted one of my favourite recipes for guests, Recipe #289327, which originally called for a store-bought bottled avo-based salad dressing. As I could no longer find this dressing, nor was it recognised by Zaar, I subbed a blend of fresh avo and mayonnaise in the recipe - but this dressing of yours is far better and so much more like the original dressing I was looking for. Very grateful to ya!"
1261705,202316,2009-05-07,5,"Delicious mayo good for pita, burritos, sandwiches, salads, even potato salad or baked potatoes.  Throw in smushed black beans and turn it into a vegan corn chip dip.  Quick and easy to make.  Just be sure to slowly dribble in the oil or else it won't turn out right.  I tripled the recipe but quadrupled the amount of oil.  The mayo stays a pretty green and doesn't turn the least bit brown.  Don't know how long it stays fresh since mine's always gone in a week so know it's good for at least that long."
212609,202316,2011-05-04,5,"I'm absolutely furious that I haven't found this recipe sooner....this stuff is amazing!!!<br/>This is a fantastic mayo substitute ( and we are die hard mayo fans in this house!!), the flavour and texture are just wonderful, and it is SO simple to make. we've been using it on everything this week, and everything has been met with groans of pleasure...DH is happy as a pig in the proverbial too, he loves it!!!<br/>What a winner!!!<br/>Made and reviewed as a THANK YOU for tagging in PRMR during the recent TIC-TAC-TOE event."
1418153,202316,2012-10-01,5,"I try to think of avocado as a fat, not as a fruit. And when I found out that avocado has its own supply of lecithin, avo-mayo seemed obvious. I googled and came to this recipe and I'm glad I did. With a couple of modifications this sauce is sublime and makes a perfect dressing for salads all by itself. I'm sure it would be a perfect stand in for mayonnaise in any recipe except maybe recipes which use the mayo as a basis for a more complicated sauce (green blue cheese dressing anyone?)<br/><br/>I have to question the use of olive oil however. Besides the strong flavor which the olive oil would lend to the sauce, I believe that olive oil doesn't emulsify as well as other oils. I have always used safflower oil for mayonnaise with good results.<br/><br/>I doubled the amount of oil and accordingly increased the amount of acid, thusly:<br/><br/>1 avocado (medium to large) <br/>1/2 lemon, juice of <br/>1 teaspoon champagne vinegar<br/>1/4 teaspoon salt <br/>1/2 cup safflower oil"
2000269896,202316,2015-06-14,5,"When we decided to &#039;go clean&#039; with our diet, some things were hard to give up.  This recipe for mayo tastes great with so many things. (The green color in some foods looks weird, but we&#039;ve gotten past that.)  I use the mason jar attachment on my Food Saver and put this in 4 oz. jars.  Vacuum sealed, it lasts several weeks."
2001540742,202316,2017-05-16,5,Super good! (I probably should stop eating it with a spoon thought haha) Cant wait to make some chicken salad and deviled eggs with it.
147076,202316,2017-06-26,4,"So I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was missing something. I added a bit of garlic and onion powder and ground mustard. It was still not right but a little vinegar and a dash of pure maple syrup made this almost exact rly like regular mayo. When I made egg salad, I could not tell the difference."
2002060540,202316,2018-03-18,0,Made this yesterday was very good I added a little siracha.
2002241135,202316,2018-08-06,5,"I hate mayo but oddly like this. Turned out well with a little garlic added in. Also, I used it as a base for Green Goddess salad dressing in place of regular mayonnaise. No one could tell it was an avocado base."
341338,243092,2008-09-07,5,"Darned near perfect! DH rates it at least 7 out of 5. I would never have thought to combine tomatoes with sauerkraut and onions, but it was really tasty. I did add a bit of garlic, though. Next time, I won't drain the sauerkraut - we both thought it should be a bit ""sloppier"". Served it with mashed potatoes and homemade rye bread. DELICIOUS!!  Thank you for posting, SweetSue."
64667,280673,2008-04-14,5,"I wish you could've seen the look on DH's face when I brought these to the table.   Something between shock and incredulity!   Like, ""what have you done now?""    I hardly ever make anything ""fussy"" and altho' this recipe hardly qualifies as ""fussy""...to him anything rolled and having asparagus sprouting out qualifies as ""fussy.""   But he was singing a different tune after he finished it off!    He told me to ""give it five stars.""   I used tilapia because that's what I buy; I also added some dry chicken bouillon to the broth for a bit more flavor.   Oh, but I forgot the onion--I just realized.   Well, such is life in my kitchen!  :-)   *Made for PAC Spring 08*"

663171,23499,2008-10-30,4,This was very different! The taste was good (you can't go wrong w/b. sugar in my opinion) but i found myself picking through and just eating the apples...
82296,344684,2010-07-07,5,"This recipe has all the things in it that I like in my deviled eggs.  Thank you for printing the recipe; I looked and looked, and this is the one I found.  I made it, then added a tablespoon of wine vinegar.  Used dry mustard instead of prepared.  Yum!  Thank you!"
130819,344684,2010-10-29,5,"We love devilled eggs, so no surprise that we loved this one. While similiar to our family favourite, we enjoyed the addition of the sweet pickle relish. Love olives but a couple of family members are not all that fond of them- so instead of adding chopped olives garnished a portion of the eggs - added little side dishes of both the black and the green olives. Everyone Happy! Thank you and your friend for sharing Aunt Hinshaw's delicious devilled egg recipe!"
734513,92914,2008-01-20,4,What a great and easy recipe!  I've passed it on to others and they love it as well.  The tenderloin stays moist and the flavour goes right through.
630709,92914,2008-03-05,5,"Fantastic! This recipe was very easy to make, quick to prepare, and so very yummy! My sweetie and I loved the flavor, and the pork was so tender. I did, however, add a 1/4 cup  of water, as the recipe didn't call for it, but I felt it was necessary. We used the left over cooked cinnamon apples as toppings for our vanilla ice cream, contributing to a delicious dessert too! Thanks so much for sharing!"
5060,92914,2009-09-07,5,"A wonderful, flavourful pork tenderloin!!  The aroma while cooking is out of this world!
I made it just as written and the results were outstanding!  Tender, juicy and delicious!  DH thought it was the best ever.  I used the dried cranberries which added a lovely bit of sweetness.  Definately will be making this again, thanks for posting."
1028770,92914,2010-11-07,5,"LOVED this recipe.  Very easy and few ingredients needed.  I cooked two tenderloins, so could serve at least six.  I added a little apple juice to the pan for some extra moisture and put in another sliced apple when I checked it after 30 minutes.  Used craisins and they were perfect.  Will definitely make this again!"
294000,92914,2012-01-30,5,My family really loved this. Everyone devoured it. I was almost bummed as my kids kept asking for more and I saw tomorrow night's leftovers disappearing. I used a Jennie-O turkey tenderloin and it turned out wonderfully. Served with steamed broccoli and a salad. Thanks!
444607,426661,2010-11-30,5,this is really yummy :) <br/><br/>i eat mine with raw honey and it makes me feel great from inside out
593927,426661,2013-02-27,5,"I would call this perfect if it called for organic, raw, local, honey and an organic avocado. I enjoyed this with an regular avocado as that is what I had on hand and the perfect honey. I will have this again! Made for Healthy Choices Tag Game 2013."
38094,16391,2002-06-17,5,"Blueberry season is upon us.  I cooked this up at the same time I was making buckwheat pancakes.  The combination was wonderful! Good, fast and easy.  All one needs.  Thanks."
95743,16391,2004-07-11,5,This was hubby's favorite of the five blueberry sauce recipes I tried after picking fresh blueberries for this winter.  He thinks the cinnamon and nutmeg really complimented and sparked up the blueberry flavor.
384923,16391,2007-10-26,4,Very good! So easy to make and it was delicious on French Toast.
759732,16391,2010-03-03,5,"I made this with only the addition of 1/4 c water and 1 tbsp cornstarch to thicken it slightly, yet give it a nice translucence. Unlike other recipes that call for the addition of flour, this recipe truly is easy and the blueberry sauce tastes fresh and ""yummy."""
324790,403891,2009-12-23,5,"I confess, I was lazy when I made this & just stirred everything together.  The mixture had some texture, but we didn't mind it.  It was great as a chip dip and dh enjoyed it on his roast beef sandwich.  I used light sour cream and real mayonaisse.  Made for Everyday Holiday Tag-Dec '09."
428885,403891,2010-01-17,5,"Oh this is wonderful! I made this for the playoff game last night, and followed exactly, except using the full fat mayo, and full fat sour cream. I mixed in the blender for 2 seconds, (only adding during the mixing time, 1/2 of the bacon). Let sit for 2 hours, then at serving time, I sprinkled the other two bacon slices, (pounded gently with a rolling pin) on top of the dip and added sliced green onion too. Needless to say, all gobbled up! Made for *Everyday is a Holiday* January 2010"
136997,403891,2010-03-23,5,Very nice. I made just 2 alterations. I used a red onion and fresh parsley. Made for Everyday Holiday Tag. :)
71324,151527,2006-01-28,5,"Yum, these are good. I used  poppy seed onion bagels and at first I was gonna skip the ranch dressing, but I'm glad I changed my mind and used it. The flavours go really well together and it's so quick and easy to make. I only topped one half of the bagel and kept the other half plain, placing it back on  top to make a sandwich. Thanks for sharing, I'll definitely be making this again. :D"
149363,135715,2005-11-29,5,"Wow!! This was awesome! My 5 year old put peanut butter in hers and said it was great too. DH and I had ours just as written, and we will be making this one again! 
Well written and easy to follow recipe, thanks for posting!"
248292,135715,2006-04-23,5,"WONDERFUL! This is truly a real treat in the morning. Very easy and quick, but incredibly tasty! I used whole wheat bread, doubled the recipe for me and my hubby, and added a splash of vanilla to the egg&milk mixture. After I took it out of the oven I sprinkled it with cinnamon and poured warm maple syrup over it. Wow! I will make this recipe often. Thank you for sharing Chef Mommie! "
198593,151504,2006-04-30,5,"Great idea for cooking a turkey!  I added s&p, garlic powder and sage to the turkey, and used the olive oil PAM cooking spray, which made it that much simpler!  The turkey was moist, delicious and falling off the bone when I opened it up!"
410574,151504,2007-11-03,3,"This was a good and easy way to cook a turkey, but I like the smell of roasting turkey on Thanksgiving Day.  Therefore, only 3 stars.  If the smell of roasting turkey is not important to you, this is your recipe."
320949,151504,2008-05-03,5,"This was the best way to prepare a turkey, if you just wanted the meat! No time was wasted picking the carcass clean, it fell off the bones. My turkey browned nicely, I think because my foil layers were thin on the top of the bird(I cut the sheets too short!). I might turn the bird upside down next time, to make the breast meat more moist."
1091748,151504,2009-12-27,5,"This was a great way to cook a turkey!  It was juicy and flavorful without having to baste it alll the time.  I used an 11 pound turkey and cooked it for a little over 3 hours, and it turned out great!"
949900,151504,2010-10-30,5,"This was so good and so easy! Everyone loved it and this will be my new Thanksgiving turkey. I mixed 2 Tbsp. of poultry seasoning with butter and rubbed it under the skin and on the outside. Salt, pepper, and garlic powder inside and out. I used a 14 pound turkey and cooked for 3 1/2 hours. Provided lots of drippings for gravy. Perfect. I might also try cooking breast side down next time to keep all that juice in the breast meat."
24386,135715,2006-04-25,4,"Although this tasted all right, I felt that the bananas were very mushy.  I think I will use this recipe and make regular French toast and put fresh sliced bananas in between slices just before serving to avoid that problem.  Served it with a sprinkle of powdered sugar.  Thanks so much for the idea."
128473,135715,2006-11-14,5,"This was a wonderful treat on this cold and dreary morning Forgiven. It brought sunshine and a smile to my face. I used challah bread and a whole banana. I served it with a little caramel sauce and icing sugar....YUMMY! The french toast was nice and puffy, the bananas were firm yet soft...very tasty. It was very easy to make. Thanks for sharing. I will make these again often."
728380,135715,2008-01-17,5,"I just had this and I am sooooo pleased that I tried it! the bananas were soft and mushy but I liked it that way. and the french toast part was soft and deeeeelish!! I tink it would have been perfect with a it of cinnamon on top, regret that i just ran out of it yesterday.... My baby nephew had chocolate syrup on his and he loved it! anyway thanks for the recipe! will definately make this again, maybe tomorrow for breakfast (:"
66008,101473,2004-11-02,4,"We ate this as a side dish with dinner and enjoyed it. I was uncertain about how to cut the baked potato. The directions sounded like you were to stuff the whole potato with the skin all around it - but I didn't understand why you would brown a whole potato. So, I cut each baked potato in half lengthwise and then restuffed them like a twice baked potato. Everyone was served half a potato. I enjoyed the Brie cheese in them - it was a very mild flavor. Thanks for a good recipe."
105471,101473,2006-04-10,5,"I love this recipe! It is the only way my husband will eat brie. The last time I made it, I used a combination of brie and fontina, and I sprinkled Parmesan on half of them before I baked them. Both types turned out very good. Thank you for this recipe."
311260,101473,2006-07-15,5,These were awesome.  I used Cambazola as it is similar in texture to the brie and I wanted a blue chese flavour.  I served it with roasted beef tenderloin. fabulous dinner.  Thanks for the great recipe
1072593,101473,2010-10-30,0,"Wonderful recipe, but woman at 2419 recipes, you need to get out of the kitchen.  Made for Cook-A-Thon for Sharon123."
679953,101473,2011-10-18,5,"Great potatoes, made as a side dish last night with a chicken recipe.  I used chives, and butter with a chicken dish .  Made for PRMR tag.,"
2131561,101473,2012-01-01,5,"We loved these potatoes.  We wrapped 4 potatoes individually in tin foil after pouring olive oil on them and adding a little sea salt.  Baked @ 375 for an hour and cut a oval hole into the potato, used a tablespoon to pull out all the guts, added to the brie mix and stuffed the skins and baked again for about 20 minutes.  Perfect!  We added a little bit of triple cheddar mix to the top for color and to give it more of a cheesy taste."
65502,101473,2012-01-28,5,Delicious! These potatoes are wonderfully easy to make and taste rich and flavourful. I just love brie and potatoes so this was a great pick for me. Made for Best of 2011. Thanks Sharon123! :)
6313,7218,2001-03-12,5,"I tried this tonight and thought it waa excellent.I do not have a steamer,so I just cooked the asparagus in salted water for about 5 minutes, then drained it and put the vinaigrette on it.  It cooked so fast I was glad to serve it at room temperature."
6512,7218,2001-05-07,4,Easy and quick recipe. I substituted Sunflower Seeds for the Pine Nuts and it was very tasty.
20202,7218,2001-10-01,5,Excellent
36125,7218,2002-03-24,5,I have made this recipe several times starting last Easter (2001). It is wonderful. Very easy to make.
4910,7218,2002-03-27,4,My whole family just loves this recipe and we are having it again for easter. Sharon cant chef in the house
4470,7218,2002-04-01,5,"Wonderful recipe.  I made it last night to go with a roasted chicken.  I served the vinaigrette hot over hot asparagus, even the aroma was great.  I used 2 cloves of garlic.I steamed the asparagus for about 4 minutes and they were thick stems (I like my asparagus still crisp).    I am so glad I checked before posting the recipe - I picked up the identical one from the internet and was all excited about sharing it and here it was already posted.   This is a really good way to serve asparagus."
82924,7218,2004-07-03,5,"This is the best asparagus recipe ever!  I let the basil, oregano, lemon juice, garic and olive oil sit combined for a bit to get the flavor mixed.  Everyone I have made this for RAVES!"
552188,7218,2008-04-27,0,I've been making this dish for almost 20 years and am never tired of it.  I serve it on top of mixed greens which goes great with the vinaigrette.
142335,7218,2009-03-12,5,"All I heard was ""YUM"".  I cooked my asparagus in a grill basket lined with foil. When the spears were done I just poured the vinaigrette in and left it on the grill until it sizzled. I also added red onion. This is one of my top favorite asparagus recipes now...so easy, everything is on hand, and great flavor!"
886156,7218,2010-03-22,5,"This is a great recipe. I tried this with company last night and everyone loved it.  Just the right amount of lemon and garlic flavoring.  We did not have the pine nuts, but it was great without."
187388,216446,2008-06-02,5,"I have been making this recipe for about a year now after finding it in my Allrecipes cookbook.  I have a few tips:
1.  Omit the salt.  Parmesan cheese is salty enough.
2.  Double all other ingredients in breadcrumb mixture.
3.  Add freshly ground black pepper for some spice.  I have also used cayenne and it works well here.
Finally, dried parsley is fine to use if you don't have fresh. 
You will adore this fish!"
804550,216446,2008-06-09,5,"I used panko bread crumbs and added dried dill weed to it. LOL!
I didn't read the suggestion from the author about adding Italian spices like basil to it. Also I didn't add salt. We still all loved the fish!
I did manage to shoot some photos of what was not consumed by the family."
791507,216446,2008-06-21,5,"This recipe is fantastic!!! It was so delicious and easy to make. My husband and I both loved it. I make fish often and this has been his favorite so far. We loved that it was crispy, but not fried. This will be one I will make for a lifetime. Thanks for sharing the recipe =)."
29300,216446,2009-03-17,5,This is a great recipe! Me and my boyfriend both loved this. Although he will eat fish he is not crazy about it so this worked out great since he loved it as well. This is a definite keeper. One of the only fish that I will eat is orange roughy. It is a little pricey but does not have that fishy taste so the price is worth it to me. I may just make this recipe again next weekend :-) Thank you Fluffster!
1180790,216446,2009-05-04,5,"YUMMY!! I tried this for the first time tonight. I had to sub a few things: I didn't have any romano cheese or garlicb  powder, so I used a garlic and herb dip seasoning and just fresh parmesan cheese. Also, I forgot about the parsley, but the dip seasoning was flavorful enough without it. My fiancee- who doesn't car too much for fish- even liked it. I had to double the breadcrumb mixture to have enough for all the fish. IT WAS DELICIOUS AND EASY- just what I look for in a recipe. I served it with a full salad (greens, radishes, carrots, sugar sanp peas, avacado, egg and apple chunks) and some garlic roasted potatoes (ala Green Giant). 
The house smelled great and everyone was satisfied. Thank you! I will definitely make this again."
1801946444,216446,2014-01-06,0,"chef&#039;s wife&lt;br/&gt;GREAT,healthy quick meal!! Loved how easy and fast it was...but sure tasted like it took a long time to prepare!"
314327,356720,2010-02-13,5,"This is great stuff...not exactly low calorie! I usually just bake it in a glass dish at 325, instead of using the bread. It is also good with crackers. Add a dash of hot sauce."
1642015,96064,2010-06-28,5,"THANK you!!! I don't always want to do a full-on batch of Hollandaise. This gives me interesting options to work with. The tastes (and recipe) are very good to begin with -- and I'm enjoying dithering with the ingredients.

I appreciate your post, greatly."
23424,96064,2004-10-27,0,"My mother made this same recipe for eggs benedict every Easter morning.  I remember eating this when I was 7 years old, that was 35 + years ago.  She gave me the recipe, and I still make it for my kids and wife's family every Christmas morning for brunch.  I do use hellmann's mayo though, and use regular prepared mustard, don't deviate from this recipe, it is perfect.  "
33588,96064,2004-11-06,5,"This is a 10 star recipe,we loved it and will make often.Thanks"
142583,96064,2006-01-26,0,"Not happy with this recipe, tasted like mayo. I thought I would try it, as I don't have a double boiler or blender.
I am going to get a double boiler. I didn't rate this because, it is only fair, to say this will do in a pinch, it is very creamy, and will suffice for people that are not ""foodies"".
 
New cooks, try it, easy, and similar to the real thing.

I did it with Hellmans, which may have added to the flavor of mayo, as it has it's own flavor."
223978,96064,2006-06-12,5,"This did the trick.  Great if you dont want to deal with the real thing.  I will use this again, it was very good."
27783,96064,2006-12-26,3,"This makes a very small amount of sauce and it really didn't taste or look much like real Hollandaise sauce does.  The mayo really is the star ingredient here and I think it tasted good, just not like Hollandaise.  I needed to add a lot more mustard and more lemon juice to balance the mayo."
124249,96064,2008-10-07,4,"I forgot to make the Hollandaise sauce for the asparagus that my son asked me to fix so I tired your quick recipe. I don't eat Hollandaise sauce so I asked him to rate it. 

Thanks Denise in da Kitchen. 

Bullwinkle"
465056,96064,2009-03-29,3,The mayo kind of overpowered everything else.  It really does not look or taste like hollandaise but it so much easier to make.  Its kind of like comparing Jello Cheesecake to a baked from scratch one. Not as good as the real thing but it will do.
695933,508914,2013-11-05,5,"A easy recipe to do as is and very good, It make me think of a German Dip. The bavarian dip is a delicious dip if I made with liverwurst and sour cream. Flavored with pickle relish, the bavarian dip is mixed together and and can be chilled if desired before serving. This is a German Beer Cheese Dip Maybe I missed it, but should there be beer in the recipe? How else does it become a &quot;hoppy, malty, creamy dip?&quot; 1/4 cup German lager beer, such as Beck&#039;s. Saute the onion for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Then remove from heat and drain. O.K. You got me thinking?? I can play with my food this time! Got to go do the happy food dance!! NOW !!..THANK YOU for the DANCE and as will for the recipe.....Happy Cooking to you ...I now have two or three ways to do this dip....Party Time....Party....Party....PRMR 2013....Grpa"
226867,508914,2014-01-01,5,This was great - all my guests loved it! It was equally good on party rye and triscuits!
67899,64291,2004-07-05,5,Wow! This is so tasty and refreshing. I don't think I would have guessed it was made with tofu. I made this using one 12.3 oz package of Mori-Nu extra firm silken tofu. I also ended up using an orange-tangerine blend instead of pure orange juice concentrate. It turned out fantastic! So fruity and delicious. I'll be making this one frequently this summer!
185987,64291,2005-01-09,5,"I aGREE with KREE!  haha, this is great!  I ate half of it by myself.  Although, I stuck it in the freezer afterwards and it was frozen stiff the next day.  I'm not sure the fridge is cold enough but maybe it is."
722910,155729,2008-01-14,2,"This recipe is ok at best. The crust didn't get crunchy and it took me 45+ minutes to get the apples to get soft (I used Fuji apples) and that made the bottom burn. Also when I added the second half of the crunch to the top of it, it also did not get crunchy either. I suggest using less apples and a different recipe for the crunch then maybe it will turn out better."
112411,64291,2005-05-16,4,"This tastes like a smoothie; good, but not what I was expecting. It DOES NOT have an ""ice-cream/sherbet"" texture at all."
841835,404550,2010-01-25,5,PPEEERRRFEECT! How did you know i wanted this right now?
403668,404550,2010-03-06,5,"This was great!  I had previously mixed 1 box cake mix w/ one box vanilla pudding mix so I could whip up cupcakes at a moments notice (at my 4 year old's request).  I had used another ""cake in a cup"" recipe but this turned out better.  I use silicon cupcake forms and put in real oven at 350 for 10-15 min. because I like the way they turn out in the oven better than the microwave.  I frosted while warm with a buttercream frosting and my boys (husband & son) LOVED them!"
169430,354791,2012-12-30,5,"Very fresh tasting and yummy. I don't know exactly how much walnut oil I used as I just added it to the blending almonds in a thin stream until I got a consistency that I like (I would think that it was under 4 oz's though). Very easy and so much more affordable that the store bought jars. I taste tasted it on a shortbread cookie, and now I'm thinking that I just might sandwich the remaining cookies with some almond butter. :D"
58852,127479,2007-02-09,5,This was over the top good.  I loved the frosting!  It was sort of carmel flavored.  Got a compliment that it was probably the best he ever tasted!  That says a lot.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!
464327,127479,2008-03-22,5,"Absolutely the BEST banana cake I have ever made. I wasn't crazy about the frosting at first, but LOVED it on the cake; the banana and brown sugar worked perfectly together! I definitely recommend doubling the frosting and keeping it at a pourable/spoonable icing stage. One problem in the directions... it calls for baking powder which is not listed in the ingredient list. I added one teaspoon of baking powder along with the baking soda and it worked perfectly so I definitely recommend that. I also cut 1/4 cup out of the sugar, used skim milk, and omitted the walnuts. The cake was perfectly spongy, very banana-y, and kept moist for days! I wanted something different from the usual birthday cake and am so glad I made this one! I don't even feel the need to try any of those highly rated, popular recipes now because this one is absolutely outstanding! Thank you!"
2000237272,127479,2015-05-30,2,"This recipe mentions baking powder but no baking powder is listed in the ingredient list, not amount is mentioned. The frosting was tasty but runny even after adding additional powdered sugar. The cake tased good but the recipe is flawed."
2002139502,127479,2018-05-17,0,I don't know what happened but this recipe didn't rise at all. I followed it just like it says on the web.
163112,83785,2007-06-10,4,This makes a LOT!!  Great for a crowd or sharing.  I chose this for the amount of vanilla & maple syrup & was not disappointed.  It is delicious.  The only thing I did differenty was to add some dried cherries. DH has been eating handfuls every time he passes the container all weekend!
56003,367486,2010-03-26,5,"This is wonderful!  I did add a little bit of dried onion, and this is all the burger needed!  Will have frequently, as it was also great over sliced tomatoes!  Thnx for posting your recipe, mailbelle.  Made for French Country Kitchen Herb of the Month recipe tag game.  Paprika!"
1191195,269983,2009-09-09,5,"Thanks for submitting this delicious recipe.  I'll have to make another batch to have some after it's cold, because it was such a hit while still warm!"
2799450,269983,2014-02-16,5,"This turned out well for me. I didn&#039;t heat the milk first. I had a cold and wanted to make it quickly. I whisked everything together and poured it into a buttered 8 inch round cake pan. I set the 8 inch cake pan into a 10 inch cake pan and poured some boiling water in to make a bain-marie. The custard took a little longer to bake, 43 minutes total. After chilling the custard had a nice consistency. Thanks for sharing this simple but good recipe."
2000144761,269983,2015-04-16,5,"Oops. ..it did not firm, I used Almond  milk. Great as a hot drink though."
2001612978,269983,2017-07-04,4,"This turned out fine for me. Since it's so hot in Massachusetts right now and I don't have air conditioning, I used my crock pot, which is quite large and broad at the bottom, used all cold ingredients, poured them in individual custard dishes and put them in a water bath. It took about 3 hours on high, but that was fine, I was in no hurry. And the custard has a lovely consistency! Thanks DoryJean!"
206747,448832,2011-06-28,4,"Prepared this for Crafty Lady 13, to share her loss of beloved pet, Maxx.  I had a jar of lemon curd type gel which I had purchased at Lenox a good while ago, and used a Duncan Hines Golden Butter cake mix.  Certainly a snap to put together, but found some un-incorporated dry mix on top after baking.  Next time -- and I WILL do this again, will be sure that all of cake mix is evenly distributed over filling, and butter more evenly distributed.  All that said -- it was very tasty, and DH had an extra helping before he went to bed !   So sorry about your loss -- pets are never far from our hearts !"
37449,122860,2005-06-08,5,Easy and good too! A lovely way to eat strawberries!
274719,122860,2009-06-07,5,"This is delicous! Sweet, tangy and a lovely hint of vanilla."
4470,262343,2008-02-15,5,"I like squash with cranberries and in this recipe the addition of the onion, sage & thyme make it doubly delicious.  I did not have any cranberry juice so I subbed apple juice - It worked.  Thanks for an enjoyable veggie dish hipbonz"
1191081,262343,2013-11-10,4,"This was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. It would make a nice side dish during the holidays. I like the mix of spices."
424680,448832,2011-09-09,5,"I do enjoy making dump cakes (so quick & easy), & so easy to change the cake mix or the pie filling or even to additional things to the filling! I pretty much followed the recipe here, although I did increase the butter a little, then used a large-hole shaker to sprinkle the butter more evenly over the cake mix ~ Works like a charm! Thanks for posting the recipe! [Made & reviewed for one of my group mates in the current Aus/NZ Recipe Swap]"
329769,448832,2012-09-02,5,"A quick and easy and delicious dessert. 5 minutes prep and it's in the oven. I used a gluten-free cake mix (Basco brand Golden Buttercake Mix 470 grams) and 125 grams of butter. Not knowing if the dump style cake would work with the gluten-free mix, I mixed the cake mix and melted buter together and spread over the top of the pie apples. Served with vanilla ice-cream and this cake was a hit with my whole family. Reviewed for September Recipe Swap in the Aus/NZ Forum. Photos being posted"
170271,448832,2012-10-06,2,"it was ""okay"" but probably won't make it again.  really wanted a cake-y texture and this was just crumbly on top.  my kids will enjoy it."
183964,135544,2005-09-10,5,"Hey Ami! I made your Baked Apricot Brie for Dugan's poker party. It was a splendid success. I set up all kinds of munchies on the buffet table but this dish was taken off and set right in the middle of the poker table. I doubt it lasted 20 minutes  

By the time I knew what had happened I think I got about 5 crackers...  

Who would have thunk that a greasy car mechanic, a bail bondsman, a feed store owner, a horse trainer, a security guard from Wal Mart, and a ne'er do well on probation for stalking his ex-girlfriend would have such refined tastes? We just must get a better class of friends...sigh. And yes, the bail bondsman did get the ne'er do well out of jail. It pays to have friends, I suppose."

85403,135544,2006-11-17,5,"I made this for a party I had last night, but substituted a Hot Mango Chutney for the preserves. Oh my goodness!!! I have a feeling I'll be asked to make this one over and over again. And the fact that it takes 2 seconds to prepare is a definite plus. Served it with assorted breads and crackers. What a hit."

3288,135544,2006-12-26,5,"My MIL made this last Christmas Eve, so when it came up to what to make this year I knew this had to be on the menu.  I did not use the exact measurements - not in my nature - but this is such and easy no fail recipe you just can't go wrong!  I used a 5 1/2 round of brie cheese...probably still around a 1/3 of a cup of appricat preserves and a handful of slivered almonds.  You have to try this recipe for something easy and elegant!  Thanks"
125808,135544,2007-01-01,5,"I made this for our Christmas party and it was the fastest-disappearing dish on the hor d'ourves table. I left off the nuts since DH can't eat them.  Everyone loved it, and I loved that it was so easy."

53932,135544,2011-11-05,5,This was absolutely delicious!
570804,135544,2012-07-04,5,This is always a hit - have also added a little curry powder to the apricot jam for a different twist and that too goes over well.

242729,383728,2009-11-28,5,"A simple and yet tasty recipe thanks Daisy! I made this as posted but only used 3 VERY large organic eggs and added a little grated Gruyere cheese on the top, for a cheesy lift! I used the pale green part of the leeks too, as we both like them. We ate this by itself for a light and veggie lunch with fresh French bread, delicious! Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #34 as well as the One Pot Wonder event in the Photos Forum and very much enjoyed. FT:-)"
1800148895,383728,2013-10-24,5,AN absolute keeper! This was such a quick and tasty recipe. I served it as a side dish along with bacon wrapped chicken...but I could certainly see it as a lovely lunch entr&eacute;e with a salad or even a brunch dish!&lt;br/&gt;I used some smoked Paprika which gave it the tiniest bit of &#039;bite&#039; as well as a sprinkling of parmesan on top. &lt;br/&gt;I also broiled it for 5 minutes until golden.&lt;br/&gt;Wonderful!!!!
457483,179066,2009-11-05,5,Mash the bana first - yum. Also good is the whole peeled banana thrown in a hot dog bun.
964903,179066,2010-02-03,5,"If you're not worried about calories add some butter when heating through, and maybe a dash of milk - mum used to make this when a kid - YUM!!

or, a bit of cinnamon and fromage frais or yogurt is also a treat :)"
190230,110087,2005-11-21,4,"This was very tasty and easy.  The only change I would make would be to the amount of butter in the crust, since it comes out very floury and crumb-textured.  I think 1/2 cup would probably better.  Otherwise, the vinegar and pepper give it a nice boost without being overpowering.  I used frozen wild blueberries, and since they're pretty tart, I added a tablespoon of sugar to the berries.  Thank you for a yummy and easy recipe!"
379453,7494,2007-05-17,5,"Loved this! So easy and the Maple Yogurt Sauce was Awesome!
Made it yesterday to use some Gala Apples that were not going to last much longer.
Quartered the apples,tossed them with Splenda brown sugar, the raisins and spice mixture and baked according to directions.
Great recipe! Thanks for posting!"
137854,7494,2008-04-25,5,"Thumbs up for a healthy, boldly spiced treat!  On the note of the spices, it certainly took the maple-yoghurt sauce to take the edge off that quantity of cinnamon, but the overall effect had the nuanced qualities of a top rate restaurant.  Some of my brown sugar topping didn't carmalize -- next time I would drop a few drops of water on top.  And presoaking the raisins (in brandy?) would prevent the hardening/burning of exposed raisins (and take the whole thing up _another_ notch!).  Thanks a lot!"
141293,206008,2007-03-28,5,This was really good and quite simple to make.  Baked the squash and sausage in the morning and put them together in the afternoon for lunch.  Topped with smoked cheddar cheese and zapped them in the microwave.  Great make ahead dish that can make weeknight meals a snap.
60992,206008,2008-02-06,5,"I would have never thought to put these ingredients together, but I am mad about it! The sweetness of the squah with the zestiness of the sausage, earthiness of the mushrooms and creaminess of the sour cream work spectacularly together! I did add a very generous dash of garlic powder to the sausage mixture will browning it, and with the sour cream I stirred in about 1/2 c. freshly shredded parmesan and some chopped parsley. I was in heaven while eating it. Just so incredibly good!"
56003,206008,2008-06-14,4,"Very well done, Lainey.  Not a thing to complain about here.  All the flavors combined well.  Only thing I added was a sprinkle of paprika for added color.  Will have this again."
736607,206008,2008-09-26,5,"Such a surprisingly good dish - agree that the combination of ingredients is not something I would normally think to use, but so glad I tried this recipe!  I pre-cooked the acorn squash in the crockpot (whole) as I hate cutting squashes -- they are so hard!  My husband, who will never try squash, actually hate half a squash, because the sausage was included.  A keeper! (Both my husband, AND the recipe!)"
457108,206008,2008-10-03,4,"Great concept!  I ended up using ground turkey, sweet onions, and red bell peppers with low fat sour cream (that's all I had on hand) and it came out fantastic.  Thanks for such a wonderful idea!"
360437,206008,2008-12-28,5,"I've made this a couple times and I just love it. I love winter squash without all the sweet stuff added. One of the times I made it I didn't have mushrooms so I substituted shredded carrots and celery. It was very good, though I prefer the mushrooms. Thanks!"
383346,206008,2009-10-05,5,"I can say that the filling is very good even though there is no cheese in it.  I used fat-free sour cream.  It's great mixed with the sausages (I used spicy), mushrooms and onion.  The only thing I didn't like is the acorn squash.  It was my first time tasting it and I won't buy it.  I think it's too sweet for my taste.  Thanks Lainey :)  Made for Photo tag.  I would do the filling to use with spaghetti squash.  It would be delish :D"
55729,206008,2010-01-07,4,"This was easy to put together and tasted good. My husband wanted butter on the squash, but otherwise I wouldn't change anything (I didn't think it needed it...) I used mild bulk pork sausage."
129372,206008,2010-11-16,5,"Absolutely love the stuffing! The sour cream really makes it. I used spicy sausage and I love the contrast with the sweetness of the squash.<br/><br/>I was afraid like another reviewer that I would need to add a little butter to the squash, but the stuffing has so much flavor I didn't find I needed it. <br/><br/>I may try making it with lowfat ingredients next time because I bet that will be great too."
1178797,206008,2011-11-05,5,"A great savory dish just in time for Autumn. I made this with hot Italian pork sausage, onion, mushrooms, and celery plus salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley. The sour cream is a must and I can see how cream cheese would be a good option as well. The stuffing is amazing! Didn't season the squash because we mixed it up with the stuffing in the skin while it cooled down."
137481,206008,2013-10-31,4,"Two of us were eating - one of us does not like squash, both of us thought this was great.&lt;br/&gt;I followed the recipe as written, but halved it since there was only one lonely squash in the bowl.&lt;br/&gt;The recipe was so easy to prepare, I&#039;m sure I will be making it again.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for this!"
198154,206008,2015-12-18,4,"I only used one squash because there was only two of us for dinner tonight.  We thought it could use a little seasoning, which could be solved by using a spicier sausage.  We just added a little garlic salt, onion salt and pepper. That did the trick! We both enjoyed it."
1480551,206008,2016-11-27,5,This was really good. We will make this again. I made the recipe as written but added a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese on top.
804550,376293,2009-06-12,4,"This recipe was very good. Great flavor combinations. Note: I would suggest not using the extremely thin asparagus as I believe it became over cooked with the times suggested. Next time I will use the thicker stalks. Made for the ""HOT. SPICY AND TASTY JUNE Event"""
548134,221942,2007-08-02,4,I made this with craisins instead of raisins...yummy!
412186,221942,2007-11-08,4,Had some leftover rice to use up and this was a great use for  that rice. Will make again.
359707,221942,2007-12-26,4,"Great way to use leftover rice from Christmas dinner! I actually used 2 day old rice from a Chinese place nearby. It worked wonders but I think it was a bit too sweet with 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time, I'll use 1/4 cup and made a binch more. I also left out the nutmeg and vanilla (by choice). Thanks for the recipe. :)"
464253,221942,2008-04-01,4,"I like how this recipe doesn't need eggs, cream, or butter. It's perfect to use up leftover rice. I did find it a tad sweet, so next time I would 1/2 the sugar. I used sliced dried apricots in place of the raisins. The spices were great, and it is a nice, light, rice pudding."
842342,221942,2008-05-18,4,"VERY GOOD! 
I used Splenda instead of sugar and cut the recipe to 1/4 cup Splenda."
2138695,221942,2012-01-07,5,"This was my first attempt at making rice pudding and it turned out Wonderfully!  I halved the recipe since I only had 1 cup of leftover rice, and added a bit less sugar - I used 2% milk and leftover Korean sticky rice (really similar to sushi rice actually) and the end result was thick and creamy and magnificent ^_^ This recipe's a keeper for sure!  And super simple to whip up in no time!"
2000126923,221942,2015-04-08,5,"I omitted the sugar and replaced some of the milk with a can of sweetened condensed milk. Turned out perfect!! Also no raisins, don&#039;t like them."
2001541961,221942,2017-05-17,4,I had a little less than 2 cups of rice. Adjusted quantities and hoped for the best. It turned out that there were some small bits of broccoli in my leftover rice. Good thing the kids aren't around any more! Made a fine dessert.
498271,320575,2009-04-17,4,"Very nice, simple, basic tuna sandwich!  I used not-to-much mayo, plenty of lettuce, and added a little salt and pepper.  Enjoyed this lunch - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring PAC 2009"
339260,320575,2010-12-24,4,"This makes for a very good basic tuna fish that allows for a lot of versatility.  I lightly toasted the bread, and added a little chopped onion and celery for some crunch.  I also added some relish.  I really enjoyed the hint of buttery flavor that you could taste along with the mayonnaise.  On my second sandwich, I made it more into a tuna melt sandwich and added a slice of America cheese.  After toasting the bread, I placed the slice of cheese on one piece of bread and put it in the microwave for about 20 seconds until the cheese was bubby.  Then I used it to complete the rest of the sandwich.  Yummy!  Made for Dec 2010 Let's P-A-R-T-Y."
377161,364083,2009-04-07,5,"I mashed the bananas before
putting them in the pan. This recipe made some seriosly good jam. Can't wait until the Grandkids
taste this!! Will be great on toast
with peanut butter. Thanks for 
such a tasty recipe!! Also it 
took about 10 ripe bananas to
get the four cups."
1235251,364083,2009-06-20,0,"I like it, my husband said he would spead it on his toast."
620435,364083,2010-12-22,5,Great recipe.  I sliced the bananas and used about 8 large bananas to get the 4 cups.  It jelled perfectly and has a great flavor.  It is sure to be a hit.  Thanks for posting.
1488977,392948,2010-03-24,5,"what a cool idea!
I followed your recipe but substituted cream for the milk.
everyone LOVED it, and it was a great use of bagels that werent getting eaten  thanks so much amber"
305531,392948,2010-04-08,5,Yum! This was so simple and tasted great. Thanks FeelinYummy for sharing. Made for PAC Spring 2010.
383346,392948,2010-05-30,5,I really liked this breakfast.  Good idea to use bagel to do french toast.  I omitted the salt.  Thanks FeelinYummy :)  Made for Holiday tag game
2000612326,392948,2015-10-27,5,"I am on vacation had some bagels and eggs to use up and tried this. Turned out yummy, even though I did burn the bagels (not my stove).  I didn&#039;t have vanilla, or cinnamon and forgot the salt...but I had some ripe bananas (I smashed) and some maple syrup that I added to the milk and eggs. Then fried up. I also made a fried banana topping with butter bananas and a little maple syrup...yummy on top! It was good thanks. Relatively easy, except for the burnt part ;( gave it some crunch though. Will try again as written, thanks."
2001315502,392948,2016-12-23,0,"They tasted great! Next time I'll cut the bagel into thirds. Maybe I should have let them soak longer in the eggs, or baked them in the oven. They were a little hard to cut through (they were pretty thick bagels), unless you just pick them up and eat them."
590105,274370,2008-04-01,5,"""These are the best!"" declared my 3yo son. I did think they smelled kind of weird when they were baking, but the taste is really good. I took them to a Boy Scout meeting, where they were neglected in favor of a table full of chocolaty goodies. I wasn't about to take home 2 dozen cookies however good they are (*especially* how good these are!), so I took them around saying, ""Barbeque Sauce cookies?"" One scout grabbed a handful saying, ""these are awesome!"" and the curiousity of many adults was piqued. Everyone thought they were very good. (And I only took home half a dozen!) Thanks! Reviewed for Newest Zaar Tag 08A. Oh! And I only made half a batch and baked them 10 minutes. Perfect!"
520150,274370,2008-05-30,4,"OK - you know I had to try these!  What are friends for, if not to experiment on??  I was surprised at how many wanted to try them - after I told them what they were.  Such odd  combination, who would have thought.  But yet, it DOES go together!  I think that overall, the guys liked them better than the girls.  Thank you very much for sharing - the adventure is well worth the effort."
599450,274370,2008-06-20,5,"These are fabulous. The guys like them with beer -- surprise! Before telling people these had BBQ sauce in them, the first guess from them was ""molasses?""  KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce is like a sweet and spicy molasses -- maybe it's the new molasses? Like 50 is the new 40? <i>Yes</>, I like to think so! Yeehaw! Thanks, Mary! Made for 123 Hit Wonders Tag.</i>"
89831,274370,2008-09-07,5,different but very good!
679953,274370,2008-10-02,5,"What NICE COOKIES.  I told the guys at work to try a couple cookies, they went through half of them wondering about the flavor,( curious ), when I told them it was KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce, they really were surprised, even though the taste of BBQ is there, Definately taste it. They eant more, so I guess it is back to the drawing board.  YOU GOT A WINNER HERE."
1185154,331874,2009-03-31,5,"Extremely good! Mine ended up being slightly salty (probably because I have salted butter) but really really tasty! The only thing I did differently was to cook the veggies with rosemary and the salt and pepper. Also used cheddar cheese instead of velveeta, but turned out VERY yummy!"
1179225,331874,2011-12-29,5,HUGE hit here! I browned my potatoes a little before adding the onions and broccoli and used cheddar cheese. It came out a little salty as Mrs. Delishis mentioned. I would cut the salt back to about 1/4 t. next time. I made it early in the day and popped it the oven when DH got home from work. He fell in love with this casserole. I think I might make this for breakfast and top with poached eggs. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.
498271,260654,2008-06-13,5,This bread was easy to make and came out very good!  It was very dense inside with a fairly crispy crust.  I used wheat flour in place of the barley flour.  This was my first try at making a bread like this one and I was very pleased with the results - thanks for sharing your recipe!
811451,260654,2008-07-30,5,Great bread! I felt like I was back at my in-laws house in Morocco! I made the bread to go along with a great dish ( Recipe #191946 ). I'll definately keep this recipe near. Thanks for sharing!
39754,260654,2008-11-01,5,"I was a bit nervous about making bread, the whole yeast thing scares me but this recipe was very easy to follow and it turned out just great. I was very pleased with myself so thanks Nasseh a definate keeper!"
1155210,260654,2009-09-15,5,"This bread was wonderful, we really enjoyed it and I'll be making it again soon. Instead of sesame seeds or cumin I used za'atar. I also used watered down yogurt instead of milk since I like the flavor that gives to breads. Thank you for a keeper Nasseh."
962690,260654,2009-11-07,5,"Easy to make.
I wanted to add sesame seeds to the dough but forgot .
Nice crisp crust with a chewy inside. YUM.
I used whole wheat flour and the unbleached flour.
Made for Zaar Stars."
583349,260654,2010-04-04,0,"This bread had wonderful flavor!  I used the barley flour and cumin seeds.  I just wish I didn't live at high altitude and have mixed results with baking bread, which is why I'm not giving it a rating.  Because Nasseh had such detailed directions that rely more on the texture of the bread than liquid amounts, I hoped this might work for me.  The texture of the dough was perfect and it rose beautifully.  The crust crisped up and browned nicely.  However, when I took it out of the oven and cut into it, the inside was gooey and sticky.  I then baked it another 10 minutes at 350, and it was still just as gooey.  So disappointing, because the flavor was great.  I will definitely try this again after doing more research on possible adjustments for high altitude and will update my review if I have any recommendations for high altitude.  Thanks for posting!"
1831837,260654,2011-03-13,5,"Unable to find barley flour, I substituted whole wheat flour.  Added the cumin seeds.  Was quite tasty.  Be aware, this is a dense and very hearty bread."
1006712,260654,2011-08-20,5,"Excellent bread recipe I have made Paula Wolfert's version many times, so this was a nice surprise. I used Nigella seeds on top as I like the taste nuances, and the breads came out perfect! On the  ""High Altitude"" baking note from another member, being an Executive Pastry Chef and having worked for many years at High Altitude, (6,300 ft,)  here is a tip"":  There really is no adjustment for yeast doughs per se. I think you had the oven temp to low at 350F. You might want to lower the oven temperature only 15F - 25F degrees max. Also, frequently you need to add a little more liquid as flours tend to dry out due to the lower humidity, but that varies depending on region. That is all, it will work excellently. Happy Baking!"
171790,260654,2011-08-28,5,"I tried making my own barley flour by placing barley in my food processor. I was able to make about 3/4 cup flour. For the other 3/4 cup I used rice flour. In deference to DH's preferences I didn't add any seeds. We loved the bread. It had a lovely crust on the outside and a nice soft, dense inside. Made for Ramadan Tag."
2001423828,260654,2017-03-08,5,"I have never made bread before and this was so easy and fun! I wanted Moroccan bread to go with a Moroccan tagine I was preparing and this was perfect! I didn't have barley flour so I used bread flour instead. For those like me who don't know what &quot;stiff dough&quot; means, I found that adding little bits of warm water at a time helped make the dough into one cohesive lump that didn't stick too much to my fingers. The cumin seeds were a big hit! Everyone at dinner agreed that they added a lovely aromatic quality to the bread. Thanks for this awesome recipe! :-)"
126440,260654,2018-03-26,4,Crust was hard but loved the flavor. Went great with our Moroccan lentil stew.
1706426,506139,2013-10-31,4,"I gave it four stars only because I found it to be too salty with both cheese and salt. Otherwise it would be great way to prepare asparagus! Thanks for sharing, made for your football win 2013"
526666,157403,2009-09-15,5,"This was really good; better than I expected. I halved the recipe and had this for lunch, and it would be great served on the side, with a lovely bowl of soup. I'd also serve as an appetizer, as the taste is great! Thanks for sharing, carolinafan."
43523032,157403,2015-07-04,4,"Originally on Taste of Home. A good appetizer to have on hand in the freezer. However, I think it needs a bit more depth. So I use 1 less t. mayo, Then add in 1 to 2 more T. Worcestershire ( low sodium) &amp; a pinch of course cracked pepper. Plus a pinch more cheddar, and 2 more slices of bacon. I do love the make ahead aspect  though.
Also, as long as your cooking up bacon, check pit the BLT dip on this site.
Tip : No need to stand and fry all that bacon..... just place a wire rack OVER TOP of a rimmed, foil covered baking sheet
 Lay bacon on the rack, then roast the bacon @400 for 18 - 20 min"
1677099,21112,2011-03-28,4,This is a nice soup.  I double the curry or more!   Nice garnishes include ground allspice or sour cream.
21752,86967,2004-03-23,5,"Major mahalos to you, Judy, this is a superb find for me!  I love the combination of the tomato juice and the lemon juice, and lots of parsley doesn't hurt either.  I used all fresh herbs instead of dried, and also threw in some coriander (cilantro).  I used this on chicken breasts and then pan grilled them.  Great Somersizing recipe as well.  I've already shared this with a friend or two!"
24386,86967,2004-08-09,5,"Marinated some chicken breasts in this recipe and grilled them outdoors.  Very tasty and delicious.  Loved the addition of tomato juice for extra flavor and I also used the fresh herbs.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Judy!"
92385,86967,2005-05-01,5,"Super marinade- doesn't overpower, but enhances the meat. I used this on steaks which I pan-grilled. Did this on the spur of the moment so didn't have any parsley, otherwise followed ingredients list and only marinated two hours. Will definitely use again and again. Thanks for posting!"
830826,86967,2008-05-02,5,"We make sasliks (term from Eastern Europe).  All it is is chunks (2 inch) of pork, chicken or beef, marinated, skewered and grilled.  I have been using this recipe for pork.  It really is a nice marinade.  It is flavorful but not overpowering.  I slice the onion into rings.  When they are nice and soft I know the meat is ready.  I include the rings on the skewer when grilling.  Tasty!"
754903,279676,2008-04-02,5,"OMG!  This ought to be illegal!  I will probably gain 10 pounds!  This is so irresistibly delicious that I just couldn't stop eating it!  Needless to say, next time I make it, I'll be having company or taking it somewhere so I don't eat it all!  Thanks for a new 'eating vice'!"
770879,279676,2008-04-02,5,"Oh for Pete's Sake!!!  First I review and forget the stars, then I do the stars and forget the review!!  Well, third times the charm (I hope).  Really great recipe.  I love the combination of flavors.  I used the plain artichokes without the brine and used reduced fat cream cheese (not that it matters with all the other good stuff). It turned out great and was really good on pary rye and party wheat breads. Thank you, and sorry for all the trouble getting this right."
398275,279676,2008-04-04,5,"Fantastic!!!  I used 2 13.25 oz. cans of artichoke bottoms and a 10 oz. wheel of brie.  Since I forgot to buy the green onions, I added 1/2 tsp of onion powder to the mixture.  I served this as an appetizer with crackers before dinner last night and we absolutely loved it!  Thanks for sharing another super dip recipe, Jeanne!  **Made for Spring PAC 2008**"
805770,279676,2008-08-03,5,"Thank you so much, this is such a good find! I actually put mine in a cob loaf & baked it that way. I scooped out the inside of the cob & served it with the extra cooked bread. My guests then started ripping the loaf (bowl) & using that. EVERYONE asked for the recipe.
I didn't bother taking the rind off the brie cheese either.
WONDERFUL DIP!!!!"
520150,279676,2009-09-01,5,"This was SO GOOD!!!!  Served it for some friends & we all loved it.  4 of us ate almost the entire thing.  It was so good on toasted bread, but also very good on crackers.  And the very little that was left, was still good cold on crackers the next day.  Thank you so, so much for sharing this.  I can't wait to make it again."
199848,279676,2013-02-17,5,"Awesome dip!  If you love brie cheese and artichokes, this is for you.  I added some extra garlic but that's all I did differently.  Thanx for sharing!"
2000178961,279676,2016-10-09,4,"I'm always looking for brie appetizers that don't have fruit in them! I used a 14 oz can of artichokes (I don't care for the oil from the jarred kind) and cut the black pepper in half because my tongue is sensitive to the heat. I found it to be a little too salty and the pepper burned just a bit. I also wasn't crazy about a full cup of warmed up mayo... it has an odd taste in mass quantity. The second time, I used half mayo and half sour cream and greatly preferred it. I only used 1/4 tsp salt, which was just right. I took the pepper down to 1/8 tsp and decided that was too little. The black pepper flavor is an essential part of this recipe - it melds surprisingly well with the brie. I will increase it next time. Oh, and cutting the rind off the brie is just a waste of time - just put it all in!"
128473,272340,2011-12-29,5,These were delicious cookies Starfire.  My family & I adored these  little treats. They were perfectly spiced and not to sweet. Quick and very easy to make. I added these cookies to my christmas tins and trays this year. Everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.
2146294,272340,2012-10-22,5,"Very yummy cookies, I can't stop eating them. I used oil instead of butter (lactose intolerant) so I had to add more flour. My 3 year old son had a lot of fun helping and making the shapes."
1803487068,338753,2014-12-10,5,This a great grilled cheese recipe. I haven&#039;t one this good in a long time.
147109,116152,2005-04-18,5,"This was such a fun treat!  I have a heart shaped muffin pan, so that is what I used and it looked so adorable!  I sprinkled with a little bit of garlic salt and pepper and cheese.  My husbad was bragging all day long that he had heart shaped eggs for breakfast!  I just love how easy these are, but how cute they turn out!  Thanks Bobtail!"
171920,116152,2005-05-13,5,"I love this recipe.  Very easy to individualize for the pickier people in your family.  We live in New Mexico and love to add green chiles to the eggs.  Using egg beaters and turkey bacon are good alternatives for those who are watching their cholesterol.  Thanks, Bobtail!"
225722,116152,2005-07-17,5,Yummy and fun.
37229,116152,2005-08-02,5,"I liked these a lot.
I scrambled the eggs instead of just dropping them in and I added cheese and a little sour cream to them. My 5 yr old really thought they were neat!"
97093,116152,2005-09-07,5,"these are great. Im doing the low-carb thing and thses hit the spot, not to mention sooo quick and easy. thanks a bunch for the great idea!"
73836,116152,2006-01-22,5,We both really enjoyed these eggs.  Not only were they delicious but they were very easily put together.  Bacon and Eggs with no greasy spatters and mess to clean up either!  I can see where this would be a super breakfast dish to make when you have a real crowd and will try it out next time I have a bunch for breakfast!  Thanks Bobtail for a new breakfast favourite!
236470,116152,2006-03-01,5,"Wish i could rate this higher than 5 stars. These were fantastic.

They were quite easy to make and i really enjoyed them.

Thanks for posting this great recipe. I shall be trying them again soon."
169796,116152,2006-03-01,5,"This was AMAZING and SO simple!  It tasted great!  I used small muffin tins, so didnt have room to add the cheese on top, but will try a larger pan next time.  This one is a keeper!  My DH and I REALLY enjoyed it! Thanks so much for sharing!"
229619,116152,2006-03-05,5,"Yum!  I made these this morning to go with Apple Cinnamon Buttermilk Pancakes Recipe #10679.  They were a big hit with my family.  Thanks for a neat idea.
"
75726,116152,2006-03-10,5,Very good and simple to make. Thanks.
302961,116152,2006-03-20,5,"I have made these for a couple of years now.  Got the recipe from a ladies magazine but I can't recall which one.  They are wonderful, easy to make and have never met anyone that didn't like them.  I do a lot of breakfast dishes because we use to our morning prayer and devotion at our church and took turns cooking breakfast for the entire group. "
274212,116152,2006-03-23,5,"Tried this and family loved it!  Had fun eating and everyone asked for more. Fun and different way to present breakfast.
"
295591,116152,2006-03-30,5,"This was really good, defintly a winner! The only problem was that one of the people who tried it diddnt like it becouse they like crispy bacon....but i guess u cant win over everyone"
173314,116152,2006-03-31,0,"similar to my recipe eggs benedict cups #106668 (I use ham,cream, and cheese). Bacon sounds like a great alternative.  Maybe you could put bacon in muffin tin first and prebake 5-10 minutes before adding the egg and all else to make bacon crispier!"
88099,116152,2006-04-01,0,"I made this last weekend and microwaved the bacon for 2 minutes before adding to the muffin tin.  I baked for about 15 minutes, but it still came out like a hard boiled egg, which we didn't really care for.  May try scrambling like one other reviewed did and see if we like it that way.  Not going to rate this because it was a personal taste difference, not the recipe itself."
56251,116152,2006-04-23,5,"I made these this morning, and they were so easy and quick to do. The only thing is I forgot to set the timer, and then went outside for a quick walk, so mine where a little over done, but that is my own fault.  I used the precooked bacon, and it was great.  I think I would like to try and scramble them, maybe add some onion, and green pepper, and more cheese!  Even my youngest liked them.  Thanks for posting."
142367,116152,2006-05-28,4,"This is a fast, easy recipe that my kids can make with ease.  Watch your oven, if you prefer your eggs a bit runny.  My picky boy likes his scrambled, so we mix his up.  The only problem I had was the eggs stick to the muffin pan, in spite of the bacon and even when we tried them a second time and greased the pan.  Use tinfoil muffin cups for easy clean up.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Bobtail!"
284897,116152,2006-07-31,0,"These are so quick and easy,and even better so tasty!! My family have enjoyed them each time I have made them. Thanks so much for the recipe."
346798,116152,2006-11-10,4,"I loved the flavor of the eggs.  They were so soft and moist and just yummy!  I changed a few things based on the prior reviews.  I cut the wide end of the bacon slice off and placed it in the bottom of the cup and I also scrambled the eggs with salt/pepper before I put them in the muffin tin.  The bacon does not get crispy so if that is an issue for you maybe pre-cook the bacon a little bit?  Anyway these were great and so easy just pop them in and get morning chores done :)  My dh didn't like them (he likes crispy bacon), but he doesn't like anything new LOL."
111610,116152,2006-12-02,5,"My grandsons are the fussiest eaters but they love these we call them egg balls 
oh.. is doneness a word hehehe
thank you sooo much"
322732,116152,2007-01-06,5,"Huge hit with the family! So easy, yet it looks so elegant! I made it with egg beaters and turkey bacon, and it worked just as well as when I made it with real eggs."
329324,116152,2007-02-23,5,"I just finished making these and they are WONDERFUL!!  I ended up only cooking them for 18 min. and think I will probably try cooking for only 15min. next time due to the fact that we like our yolks a little softer.

This is such an EASY recipe, it would be great for my DD's to have before school.  They are eating them now and give them two thumbs up!

Thank you for posting this recipe, I am sure it is something that will be made often in our household."
51011,116152,2007-03-31,0,"I made these for my breakfast this morning... I did not read before making about the bacon not getting crispy, so for my mistake, I will not give any stars.  I did like the flavor, but not the soggy bacon.  The parts that got crispy were great, as were the eggs w/ cheese.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Perhaps next time I will cook the bacon before making."
14410,116152,2007-08-08,5,"Very easy and tasty. I made three scrambled and three crack-and-drop. My husband preferred one style, I preferred the other, so it's great that this can be personalized so easily. I may add veggies next time. And I think next time I'll save empty tuna cans and use those instead of muffin cups. That way, my bacon-eggs will be the right size to serve on toasted English muffins like the fast-food restaurant breakfast sandwiches. I have two left that I put into the freezer to see if this recipe is suitable for OAMC..I will update my review next week when I try them.
updated to add...last night we tried the two that were frozen. The texture became somewhat rubbery, and the taste was not as good as when fresh."
369715,116152,2007-08-23,4,We really liked these. Will make again. I make them on the weekend and pop in the microwave at work for a quick healthy breakfast.
511821,116152,2007-11-21,4,"I would give this five stars, but I added to it and that is what was so delicious.  I made two just like the recipe, but I don't think I will eat that, but my boyfriend will tell me if they were good.  I made a variation with tomato basil feta, salt, pepper, minced onion and red bell pepper scrambled in with the egg.  Another variation omited the feta and minced onion.  I used maple bacon because I think it's the best.  I baked for about thirty minutes and they are great!  I wanted to try something new for breakfast, this was great we will have it again.  Thank you for a keeper.  I need to get a larger muffin pan because the egg really overflowed."
32143,116152,2008-03-04,5,"Really yummy! My daughter and I made 6, 3 dropped in and 3 scrambled, great both ways! Sprinkled with shredded  mozzarella/ cheddar mix. Thank-you!"
229850,116152,2008-05-11,5,"These were sooo simple and great !
I did cook the bacon a little before making, as my bacon was thick. Yummy !!"
58439,116152,2008-05-20,5,"SO simple, easy to do!
Made them in rose shaped pan too!
Looks like I did fuss for today!
Added finely diced mozzarella, tomato, salad herbs...is my way!
When looking for something different to do!
GREAT for entertaining...so THANK YOU!"
64203,116152,2009-01-10,5,"What a fun, easy and versatile recipe! So much more ""elegant"" than plan eggs and bacon, and a lot of fun too. Clean up was a breeze and my entire family from age 2 to 34 gobbled these up. I added cheese, a tiny bit of salt and cracked pepper. Yum!"
55729,116152,2009-09-07,3,"I really didn't like how this turned out. The yolks would have been perfect after 20 minutes, but the whites were still runny. When the whites were ok, the yolks were overdone (I guess eggs cook differently in a pan). The bacon was rubbery. And they DID stick, badly. Several of the photos seem to have used oversize pans - maybe that would have worked better; I used a standard-sized pan."
237427,116152,2009-10-01,5,Thsnk you for an easy & fun recipe. This is a keeper :)
1423767,116152,2009-10-23,5,"These came out great! I scrambled the eggs first and added some salt, pepper and some cheese. To take them out of the muffin tin take a knife and cut around the edge and then pinch either side of the bacon and lightly twist it out. ^^ awesome recipe! Love it!"
303427,116152,2010-01-25,5,"I, too, thought this recipe was terrific! I tried it both ways, cracking an egg into the center and topping with cheese as well as scrambling together with cheese and pouring the mixture inside and both were great! The difference is just whether you'd like all of your yolk together or if you'd like it spread out. My bacon didn't cook to my liking in the 22 minutes I allowed, so in the future I will try it for 30 minutes like some of the other reviewers. I will be making this one again! Thanks so much!"
74904,116152,2010-02-27,5,I can't believe I have not rated this!  I can't count how many times my family has enjoyed this Recipe.  Thank you Bobtail!
126440,116152,2010-02-28,5,"Great breakfast. I cooked mine
 25 min. and they were perfect for us. Mine stuck to the muffin pan and is soaking now so will probably spray the indentations first next time."
43083,116152,2010-03-02,4,These were very tasty and my BF and I really enjoyed as did my son. Thanks for posting:)
1612655,116152,2010-05-09,3,"Everyone enjoyed, but the eggs were hard cooked.  Next time I think I will pre-cook the bacon cups 10 mins and then cook the eggs 10 mins so the yolks are not solid. Otherwise great!!!!  Big brunch hit!!!"
782050,116152,2010-08-23,1,"I **REALLY REALLY** wanted to love these but this is the worst preparation of eggs that I've ever tasted. I had read the other posts complaining about ""hard boiled"" so i watched them carefully in the oven. The problem is, the eggs seemed to cook from bottom-up, so the whites were runny up til the end of cooking, so it doesn't appear there is any way to avoid the hard-boiled-type yolk. In the end, the whole egg was tough. The flavor was good, and presentation delightful, but I really like my eggs tender. I will be trying these again, covering with foil to see if this allows for less cooking time and a more tender egg. I may also try scrambled, as then the state of the yolk doesn't matter. I'll also cover with foil so the oven doesn't dry it out, and experiment with cooking time. By the way, I did precook my bacon--I just KNEW that my particular bacon would not work without precooking. If I can get any variation to  work, I will update my rating, but as for now, this is basically the worst egg-breakfast I've had in a long, long time."
1838488,116152,2011-02-25,2,"The best oven cooking time for eggs is about 8-13 minutes; using fully cooked meats like ham or prosciutto - my favorite - makes it easier to cook the eggs to your liking and still have the meat be safe to eat.  Otherwise, partially cook the bacon before lining the cups or before adding the eggs is the best."
1308592,116152,2011-04-26,5,"These really are delicious,,,I personally dont mind the hard yolk, but I think next time I might try a slice of tomato between the egg and the cheese,,,this might not help much with the yolk problem but it will add another flavour to a really tasty and simple brunch dish"
2757166,116152,2013-03-27,3,"Bacon didn&#039;t cook through, and eggs hard"
1802297586,116152,2014-01-15,2,"This is very similar to how I make my bacon and egg cups. First of all, for those saying the bacon is not cooked through, trust me when I say this: precook your bacon in frying pan first! Only cook till partially done so its still flexible. Drain on paper towels. Then line the muffin tin with the bacon. The results are so much bettter. When I make these, first I spray my muffin pan with cooking spray,then take a slice of bread, and cut out circle with biscuit cutter then pat down on the bread to make it flat. Then slice in half so you have two halves.place one half in tin the the next half so it lines the muffin cup. Use extra flattened bread to fill hole on bottom. Then brush the breads with melted butter. Then lay a partially cooked bacon slice directly in the cup, letting the bacon hang over a bit on the sides. Then crack your egg in the cup over the bacon and bake in oven. Or for those who don&#039;t like the hard cooked eggs, whisk the egg in a bowl with a splash of milk, and fill muffin cups 3/4 full and bake. Trust me this method is so much better!"
2001117140,116152,2016-08-06,5,As others have stated let the bacon bake for 10 minutes before adding the egg and cheese otherwise it's a fantastic eat.
2001135093,116152,2016-08-20,5,"My first time making it and it was a big success ! I bought turkey bacon instead and also scrambled the eggs adding the salt and pepper prior to pouring it on the mold. Lastly, I added the cheese 10 minutes before taking them out. My family loved it ! Wish we had the option to share the photo :)"
1060667,116152,2017-03-30,4,"Definitely precook the bacon, unless you want a piece of raw bacon going in your mouth :\ I precooked mine until it as about 3/4 of the way done. after 17 minutes in the oven my egg was completely cooked through. Next time I will start checking at about 12 minutes so I can attempt a runny yolk. Nice idea though and would be great for on the go breakfasts :)"
2688425,116152,2017-04-28,3,Quick and easy but bacon was undercooked for my taste.
2001536829,116152,2017-05-14,1,Very disappointed. Bacon was raw and eggs were overcooked. We threw them out. Next time we will try precooking the bacon for 10 minutes and hope for better results.
2001537264,116152,2017-05-14,1,Will not make again. The bacon did not cook even though I kept it in the oven an extra 10 minutes. The eggs were overcooked and I threw out the bacon because I was afraid to get sick.
2001545674,116152,2017-05-20,0,Please Make Sure You pre-cook your bacon its common sense dont cook it to a crisp
2001494310,116152,2017-05-20,5,"Beautiful and yummy, this will definitely be a repeat. Presents great for company or brunch. I did precook the bacon a little before lining the muffin tin and 20 minutes is too long for the eggs as others noted. I did 12 minutes and kept checking them, take them out early because they will continue to cook. I tried grated gruyere cheese and it was fabulous."
2001695335,116152,2017-08-31,4,Wonderful and easy breakfast with few dishes to clean or tentativeness. The only tricky part is getting the egg to the right doneness if you're not scrambling them.
2000972546,116152,2018-02-05,0,We really liked these and so easy to make. Thought the egg was cooked too hard. I had a brainstorm this morning - Eggs Benedict with my leftover Hollandaise Sauce. Pre-cooked the bacon in the muffin tin for 20 minutes and then baked it with the egg for 11 minutes. (just kept checking it) The eggs were perfect ( little runny). Then put on toasted English Muffins and covered with Hollandaise Sauce. They were so good. And easier than regular Eggs Benedict.....and only one dirty pan.
486725,359442,2009-07-13,4,"These were very yummy. I used olive oil, no butter. I used a nonstick roasting pan, but the balsamic did stick and burn a lot. The flavor was still really good though."
222564,359442,2017-04-25,5,"Really tasty, how could it not be with all that balsamico!?! Looks like way too much vinegar, but it so is not. I'm not afraid of butter, but 7 oz was slightly too much, some of it was still lying on bottom of the baking dish in the end. Slight decrease there, and this is way to go!"
131126,382940,2009-09-15,5,I used tilapia fillets and made a few additions to the recipe.  I sprinkled each fillet with lemon pepper before adding the citrus juices/butter.  I also added chopped parsley at the end.  The fish cooked quickly and had a nice flavor.  Made for Fall '09 Pick A Chef.
440324,382940,2009-09-25,4,"This was great, but next time I think I'll marinate the fish in the sauces before hand. The flavor did not penetrate the fish as much as I would like it to. Overall, a good recipe. Thank you."
287601,153185,2006-01-26,0,"sounds great!
Im going to try it but I think I will use v8 juice instead of water to simmer it in."
23400,26420,2002-09-24,5,great recipe!! I used 1 1/2 TBLS horseradish and found it had just the right bite. And all the ingedients were staples I already had on the shelf so you can make it on a moments notice. I always keep a bag of frozen cooked shrimp in the freezer and this was perfect with it.
24386,26420,2002-11-11,5,Made this last night and it is great!  Made exactly to recipe.  Thanks!
55181,26420,2002-12-26,5,I made this for Christmas Eve.  All my family thought this was the best ever.  I have added this to my recipe file and I don't think I will ever buy ready made again.  So easy to make.  
41879,26420,2003-03-20,5,"This is a wonderful cocktail sauce, and so easy to make.  It's best made a little ahead.  We've had it with shrimp and with crabcakes.  DH even made it all by himself once!!!  Thanks, Darlene."
57939,26420,2003-03-23,5,FORGET THE SHRIMP! I used this as a cocktail sauce for crabcakes - it was wonderful! Followed the recipe exactly except eliminated the salt.  It was still perfect! My previous recipe was ketchup with horseradish.  Never again! This is going in my recipe box immediately.  Thanks Darlene
68727,26420,2003-09-13,5,Tasty stuff!  I used this sauce as a topping for crab dip.  I made this recipe with 1 TBS of creamed horseradish and added a dash of hot sauce.  DH commented that the sauce was very good.
33443,26420,2003-10-21,5,"Wow! What a great flavour! I used 2 tblspns of horseradish and added a zested clove of garlic. No need to ever buy storbought again, this was way too good and very economical to boot!"
54885,26420,2003-11-29,5,no more store bought for me. this was really yummy and so easy to make
116608,26420,2003-12-22,5,made this for shrimp it was so good we bought more shrimp the next day and had it again no more bottled sauce for us thanks will use over and over again angie
44383,26420,2004-12-28,5,Made this Xmas day for shrimp appetizers and it was fantastic and oh so easy to put together the day before.  This is a keeper staple recipe for me. Thanks!!
132383,26420,2005-06-06,5,This was so easy and simple.  Thank you so much.
118159,26420,2005-08-05,5,"This is the same as my own recipe, delicious!  Also great on fresh oysters.  Once in awhile I will use freshly grated horseradish for extra zing and have horseradish leftover for prime rib."
192581,26420,2005-08-22,5,"This was very, very tasty.  Flavor was excellent.  I used two (generous) tablespoons horseradish.  The texture is different from my favorite jarred brand, but this is so economical it's worth it!  The same no. of calories as my brand, too."
173838,26420,2005-10-24,5,"Measurements are right on in this easy to make cocktail sauce. I also added a dash of Tabasco sauce. Thanks, Darlene, for a great recipe!"
141816,26420,2005-11-04,5,I love this! I used wasabi instead of tradional horseradish. Gave it a nice bold kick. Simple and items on hand in most pantries.  This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!
169969,26420,2005-12-06,5,This was so easy to throw together and tasted so much better than store bought jarred sauce! I added a little extra horseradish because we like a little extra kick. Everyone raved about this sauce during dinner. Thanks!
1522598,26420,2010-01-23,5,Oh yeah!!  Perfect cocktail sauce!  Reminds me of Red Lobster's cocktail (which I love!).  I followed the recipe.
175824,26420,2005-12-26,5,"This was terrific. I will never again use store bought cocktail sauce again. I made this for one of my Christmas Eve appitizers. Everyone raved about the sause. I used slightly more than 2 tablespoons of horseradish, otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. Thank you for an easy and tasty recipe. This is a keeper. "
148316,26420,2005-12-31,5,"Yep - the bomb!  Quick, Easy, Tasty and Delicious - You couldn't ask for better - Picture it... it's New Years Eve - you're bringing the shrimp but the cocktail sauce you thought you purchased is no where to be found - quick to recipezaar!  This recipe is put together faster then you can say shrimp cocktail!  I will never need to purchase store bought cocktail sauce again! Happy to have found this little life saving recipe :)"
19198,26420,2006-01-03,5,Excellent and even better the second day!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe! 
129177,26420,2006-01-29,5,This is really good! It reminds me of the sauce that was used in those premade shrimp cocktails in the seventies and eighties. You can add me to the list of those who will never use storebought again! Thanks for the recipe!
279240,26420,2006-03-04,5,"Bethany, know the ones you mean!  I think they are called Sausea shrimp cocktails.  I use to eat 'em all the time.  
Well, made this sauce about 5 times now..guess I should review it.  Umm..  Love it!  I got for the full 2 Tbl of Horsie..and I'm a little heavy in my pouring of the lemon juice and worcestershire sauce - just my old taste buds.  Great sauce!  Eating it even as I type!  I buy bags and bags of the little frozen shrimp (prawns over here..)..make loads of sauce..mix it up, stick it in the fridge and nibble about a pound at the time! Wonderful!"
279506,26420,2006-03-28,5,"I noticed the sauce (store bought) we already had was out of date :( , so I had to hurry and make some before I go to work... I love it, and I hope my husband will.. I'll let you know ! Thanks !!!!!!!"
113941,26420,2006-04-09,5,"PERFECT!!!! I'll never have to buy it again!! I was scared to try this at first because of it calling for ketchup, I thought you had to use chili sauce! The ketchup worked perfectly!! I halved the recipe but did add 2 whole TABLESPOONS of horseradish! We LOVED it!!! Thanks SO MUCH!!!"
119466,26420,2006-05-01,5,This complemented our shrimp nicely tonight. I added extra horseradish and quite a bit of Tabasco. Delicious--thanks for posting!
231054,26420,2006-06-08,5,"This is the same cocktail sauce my mother used to make and I've been making it for well over 45 years.  The only difference is that I begin with Chili Sauce instead of catsup.  If you haven't tried it that way, please do.  I think it will make this excellent recipe even better."
228742,26420,2006-09-09,5,Great recipe!  I'm an absolute wimp when it comes to horseradish so I only used 1 Tablespoon of it and the sauce is perfect.  Thanks!!
103849,26420,2006-10-28,5,Super easy.  Tastes great. I didn't add the salt or pepper.  Hardest part was finding the horseradish in the refridgerated section at the grocery store.
242250,26420,2006-11-06,5,I love making my own sauces and this is definitely a keeper!
336058,26420,2006-12-23,5,"I just love this website!!!  Now I can make my own, healthy, cocktail sauce for the shrimp/crab dip for Christmas.  I used the catsup, 1 T horseradish, lemon juice and Worcest. and it turned out great.  I might use a little more horseradish next time.  It doesn't make 1 1/2 cups though, jus over 1 cup.  The sodium is 138.75 mg per tablespoon."
278113,26420,2006-12-24,5,Fabulous!! I will never use store purchased again!
367916,26420,2007-01-06,5,Good sauce! Just enough tang for us with 1 Tablespoon horseradish.
405655,26420,2007-01-26,5,Loved this recipe!  So simple and used ingredients I always have on hand. I have not been able to find a store bought cocktail sauce I like.
438966,26420,2007-01-27,5,Delicious! I used Low Carb catsup and added some Mexican hot sauce to give it a big kick.
146284,26420,2007-03-10,5,"This was way better than the bottled sauce from the supermarket, and especially convenient to whip up with ingredients I always have on hand. Many thanks for the great recipe."
138051,26420,2007-03-28,5,"I made this last night. I thought I had jarred cocktail sauce on hand, didnt. Hubby was out of sorts as we were having shrimp. I said, well, let me look on zaar. There is always something there.

You saved the day. We loved it. He said this is a keeper, going ummmmm!!

373817,26420,2007-04-03,5,"Very good! I used this to dip my fried shrimp in and it was perfect! I  only had some wasabi paste on hand, so I used that instead of horseradish, and it tasted great! Thanks!"
362734,26420,2007-04-11,5,"I made this without the Worcestershire sauce, as I was out, and it was just perfect. I'll try it with it next time. Thought it was much better than store bought. HK"
227607,26420,2007-06-01,5,Perfect...I cut the recipe in half and it was the perfect amount for our shrimp...I will never again buy cocktail sauce.  This was so easy and soo good.  Thanks for a great recipe.
452355,26420,2007-06-21,5,"Delicious, as well as fast and easy.  I'll definitely be using this as my cocktail sauce recipe!  Thanks for this keeper!"
250230,26420,2007-07-01,4,"This was sooo good, I will never use store bought again. Thank you for sharing!"
126104,26420,2007-10-12,4,"This was really good.  I whipped it up tonite to have with some crab as a snack, and totally enjoyed it."
88717,26420,2007-11-07,5,"This was very good. I followed the recipe except for adding about 4 drops of Tabasco, for personable preference. Thanks for posting. This was easy to make and made with ingredients I keep on hand.
I'm updating this recipe just to say that when I go to a resturant now I notice it's not near as good as this recipe. This has become our favorite, and I'm thinking of giving the recipe to our favorite resturant's owner. LOL~"
676529,26420,2007-12-04,5,"Loved it...loved it....loved it!!  I forgot to buy cocktail sauce at the store, so I looked for a recipe.  I will never buy store bought shrimp cocktail sauce again.  Thanks for the recipe. :)"
140806,26420,2008-01-21,5,DH LOVED this and has now vowed never to buy cocktail sauce from the bottle ever again! He used this recipe as a bed for Grandma's Clam Dip #37168 and he can't wait to try it with shrimp. Too easy!
743475,26420,2008-02-04,5,This is BETTER than store bought!!! THANKS!!!
302744,26420,2008-03-23,0,"Yet another rave review.  This is way better than any bottled cocktail sauce.  I upped the heat with close to 3 tablespoons of horseradish.  Another reviewer mentioned adding garlic, which I will definitely try with the next batch.  Yum!"
340776,26420,2008-04-09,5,"Delicious! As was suggested by some other reviews, I used half chili sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I used two generous tablespoons of creamy horseradish sauce since it was what I had on hand. It had a lot of kick and tasted excellent. I am going to make more shrimp tonight just to use more of this."
112489,26420,2008-05-07,5,Another great review for this cocktail sauce!  This was so easy and I won't ever buy cocktail sauce again.  Much better than store bought and I know what's in it!
570154,26420,2008-06-28,5,excellent sauce easy thank you for posting
188837,26420,2008-08-25,5,"very easy to make and delicious - I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice instead. Tastes just like the kind you buy, but much nicer to make your own, knowing what goes into it!"
937563,26420,2008-08-28,0,Best I've ever made. No salt or pepper necessary
546216,26420,2008-10-18,5,This is so easy to make and tastes so much better then store bought.  Thanks for posting!
26512,26420,2009-01-01,5,Excellent. I used a lot of horseradish and a bit more worcestershire. Thanks for the recipe.
1022468,26420,2009-01-09,5,Wow this was good! Definitely deserving of its rating!
1090141,26420,2009-01-10,5,"OMG, so good and incredibly easy!"
242642,26420,2009-02-14,5,"OH YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM
I never remember to rate recipes but after my fam and I GORGED ourselves I waddled back to the computer to say WOW.  SOOO much better than what they try to sell you in the stores!"
573772,26420,2009-02-18,5,Tasty and easy!
362892,26420,2009-03-18,0,The BEST! I mixed half catsup and half chili sauce for added flavor. We like horseradish so I went with the larger amount of horseradish ( 2T.). Thanks so much for posting:)
174991,26420,2009-03-22,5,Great tasting.  We used it with shrimp and everyone loved it.
1072593,26420,2009-04-10,5,"Not just for shrimp, delish with crawfish, too!"
1188379,26420,2009-05-05,0,Simply DELICIOUS!!!!  Thanks for sharing!
13705,26420,2009-06-11,5,I've been making my own cocktail sauce for several years now but never thought to add Worcestershire sauce.  It was a great addition.
445122,26420,2009-06-15,5,"Really good!  I used 1 1/2 tbsp horseradish and lime juice, just because I used my only lemon to boil my shrimp in.  I also used 1/2 cup chili sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup.  YUM!"
318235,26420,2009-06-24,5,Restaurant quality cocktail sauce that tasted delicious with the shrimp cocktail I made last night. I will always use this recipe from now on. It was so easy! Thank you.
231198,26420,2009-08-03,5,This was really good!  I planned on having shrimp for dinner but didn't realize I was out of cocktail sauce.  Your recipe saved my dinner!  Thanks for posting.
55392,26420,2009-08-06,5,Amazing! My 2 yo ate it more than the shrimp.
868626,26420,2009-08-13,5,Great tasting sauce for our shrimp!  We enjoyed it so much!
567380,26420,2009-10-05,5,This is so easy and delicious.  I will never by cocktail sauce again.  Thank you!
1350389,26420,2009-12-17,5,Excellent as written.
848507,26420,2010-01-04,5,Thank you! I made fried shrimp and had no cocktail sauce---this recipe was a life-saver!
301487,26420,2010-02-08,5,"This is incredible! I make an appetizer that is baby shrimp and cocktail sauce pored over a block of cream cheese and this sauce made it amazing. I have always liked the appetizer, but yesterday at my Superbowl party, all of it disappeared in record time! Thanks for posting this recipe. I added the full 2TBS of horseradish and I will never buy pre-made cocktail sauce again."
440324,26420,2010-02-10,5,Terrific!
449500,26420,2010-02-15,5,Excellent! I added about 1-2 tsp of hot sauce to make it spicier. Thanks for sharing!
171328,26420,2010-02-26,5,"Wow!!  It's perfect!  If everyone knew how easy it was to make Cocktail sauce, Hoffman's would be out of business!  Thank you, you just saved me a trip to the grocery store!"
817360,26420,2010-03-07,4,Pretty good cocktail sauce- but a bit bland for us. Next time I'll tweak it up for us. thanks for sharing.
158086,26420,2010-05-02,5,Great shrimp cocktail sauce...so darn easy I don't know why I bought it in a jar...
844554,26420,2010-06-04,5,It was perfect for us. I never buy the jar anymore and this recipe is a keeper.
423494,26420,2010-10-07,5,The flavors are perfect.  I added more horseradish to taste.  Never by bottled again!
333017,26420,2011-01-28,4,I was using up some prawns from the freezer and I knew that I would find a recipe here.  I wasn't disappointed!  The only change I made was that I only had 3/4 cup of ketchup left (opps!!)...used 1-1/2 T horseradish...a good shake of wort. sauce and a good pinch of my special pepper blend.  Yum!!  I would definately do this one again!  Thanks for the posting!
1890285,26420,2011-04-21,4,very good i defroster a pound of shimp and was out of sauce this was a life saver . Very good .
31807,26420,2011-05-03,0,Needs a lot more horseradish for my taste.
1920372,26420,2011-05-29,0,really good!  I will never buy bottled again!
1934824,26420,2011-06-18,5,This worked out great when we someone brought shrimp but no sauce. I did not have horseradish so I used Dijon mustard. which will work if in a pinch.
914720,26420,2011-10-19,5,This is nice to put together at the last minute to go with boiled shrimp.  Half a batch is enough for our family.  Thanks for sharing!
305531,26420,2011-10-26,5,This was a great cocktail sauce. Easy to make and went really well with shrimp. Thanks Darlene Summers for a nice treat. Made for Cookbook Tag.
445033,26420,2011-12-25,5,Best sauce ever!
18745,26420,2012-01-02,5,Excellent!  Needed a small portion (I halved the recipe) of this because I rarely buy cocktail sauce and when I do it usually doesn't taste good after it is in the refrigerator too long.  Very nice taste and you can make it as spicy as you like it.  I did add some tobasco sauce as we prefer a little extra spice. Yum!!
15521,26420,2012-01-21,5,This was an easy and tasty recipe.  Next time I might up the amounts of lemon juice and horseradish.  It was a little sweet for my taste and this might help cut that sweetness.
2638980,26420,2013-01-16,5,"This is a super easy to make sauce, I had all the ingredients right at home.  I used 2TBS extra hot horseradish and gave it a nice kick.  Thanks for posting Darlene!"
134624,26420,2013-02-10,4,"My family is attempting to use fewer commercially prepared items, and I was needing some cocktail sauce for later this evening. I literally just finished making this, and it couldn't have been any easier. It tastes so much fresher and cleaner than the supermarket variety; I can't believe I didn't try making this earlier. I made this using ketchup recipe #343611."
328542,26420,2013-06-24,5,"My husband dislikes horseradish and he enjoyed this sauce. Served with cod cakes. Halved the recipe, using 1 Tbsp horseradish, but still had extra.  Will cut it in fourths to make enough for only a meal."
429182,26420,2013-08-29,5,yum yum....definitely 2 Tblsps. of horseradish for our tastebuds!
693345,26420,2013-09-12,5,"Great sauce! I cut it down to 1/4 of the recipe, just estimating ingredient amounts that became too small to measure. So easy and tastes perfect! I am definitely keeping this recipe, thanks!"
959326,26420,2013-10-25,5,Very easy to make with ingredients around the kitchen. I doubled the quantities and added a dash of Louisiana Hot Sauce to kick it up. Everyone in the party enjoyed it and wanted some more. Next time I will triple the quantities.
297761,26420,2014-03-28,5,"This was excellent -- I usually hate all other forms of purchased cocktail sauce because they&#039;re too sweet or just blah. However, sometimes I just purchase Silver Springs cocktail sauce (found in the cold-case deli section of the store) and add a little extra horseradish to it and it&#039;s very good."
2000886170,26420,2016-02-22,5,Easy &amp; delicious.  Better than anything you can by at the store.  Love it!
2000997235,26420,2016-05-02,5,Easy and delish!
2001417173,26420,2017-03-04,5,Super easy. Didn't have horseradish though. Instead of going to the store to get it I used Wasabi paste I had in the fridge. I used 1T but it was too much. Doing it again I would add 1tsp and go up from there. I also added dehydrated onions to the mix. About 4tsp. Tastes great after letting the flavors meld.
2001511195,26420,2017-04-28,0,This is perfect. I &quot;up' the horseradish. So-o-o tasty.
2001607116,26420,2017-07-01,0,Wonderful recipe! I made it on the spur of the moment and it was perfect!
1185804,26420,2018-04-25,5,Made a half recipe and it worked great!
2001610036,26420,2018-06-10,5,Followed the directions exactly and this turned out delicious!! I used it to dip my tempura shrimp. Won't be buying store bought cocktail sauce again. My new go to recipe:)
2002314081,26420,2018-10-27,5,No need to ever buy cocktail sauce again.
58104,59885,2003-05-21,5,"You All have to try these!
I took all the steps and made it very easy. I just put all the ingredients in foil then into a hot oven. And BOY were these too good and so very easy! As well as no clean up being cooked in foil.
Oh I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.
Thanks for posting this wonderfully sweet recipe.
"
37449,59885,2003-09-07,5,"Wow was this good! I loved the clean up-so easy and quick! The flavors were perfect! I used yellow onions and forgot the parsley. It didn't matter, this was wonderful! Thanks for posting!!! I halved the recipe and ate it all myself, hehe."
4470,59885,2003-09-29,5,"Excellent ""do Again 4 Sure"" recipe. I placed non stick foil on thebaking sheet. I still have small 2"" sweet onions from the garden so I used thom, cut them in half , cut side down and baked them for 30 minutes - uncovered. Flipped them and added a small spponfull of the balsamic mixture on each onion, baked for a further 15 minutes.  I made the balsamic mixture early in the day and added it cold to the onions.  I forgot the parsley but the onions were perfect .I  cut the recipe to 1/3 but will make at least half next time they are so good Thanks evelyn/athens"
69395,59885,2003-12-05,5,Who would have thought? Onions??? Wow...Great flavors...great recipe! A huge hit! Thanks Evelyn
120746,59885,2004-03-14,5,"Talk about heaven on earth and this
recipe would definitely qualify!!
I made an all Greek meal for guests
with these wonderful onions and
Evelyn's Baked Spinach #82034 and it was one of the best meals we have ever had bar none. These are
the perfect balance of sweet and
tart. DH said to make them just for
the family next time!!"
68207,59885,2004-05-03,5,"These are AWESOME.  Followed the receipe exactly except for the parsley because I didn't have any.  As the others have said, we were eating them out of the pan before they got to the table.  I'm going to give this recipe to all my onion loving friends.  Thanks Evelyn!"
111313,59885,2005-03-08,5,AMAZING!!! YUMMY!!! WONDERFUL!!  What else can I say.  I have to agree that the onions rarely make it to the table.  Even made them for an office Christmas party and they went very quick.  Easy and amazing flavor.  Thanks for sharing!
200862,59885,2005-10-30,5,"Evelyn, I made these tonight exactly according to your recipe, just halving the quantities as it's just husband and me. It was a side dish for crispy prawns and stir-fried Tat-Tsai with some side salad. It's wonderful. In summer I will definitely make it to go with barbecue meats. Perfect. One of those perfect recipes I have seldom come across (I usually change recipes!) Not this one."
178504,59885,2006-01-12,5,What a great way to make onions into something really special.  Made exactly as written - they were exdellent.
146284,59885,2006-02-08,5,"Oh my, these were good! I used Splenda in the balsamic drizzle, and didn't have any parsley, but the results were still outstanding."
205786,59885,2006-02-15,4,"This was very good and any shortcomings may have been because of the onions I used - I had only yellow cooking onions on hand and they remained rather tough, not getting the buttery texture I was looking for.  Next time I will try the red onions and perhaps take Rita L's suggestion and just wrap 'em up in foil."
142367,59885,2006-11-03,4,"These are good, but I nearly didn't serve them to guests, as they looked very unappetizing.  I had made them ahead, as the recipe suggests, and perhaps that is part of the problem.  They were good, but I think 1/2 an onion per person would have been plenty in our case and we like onions.  Thank you for sharing."
165528,59885,2007-04-05,5,"I have been remiss in reviewing this - this recipe got us hooked on Zaar to begin with!!! Never-mind the balsamic (though it's wonderful) - the onions just never seen to make it out of the kitchen. Like onion rings, only sweeter, better and hardly any calories. Thank you Evelyn, we've made these at least once a week for over a year!!"
279357,59885,2007-11-23,4,"i fully cut the onions and slow cooked them on the stove top with olive oil, balsamic, sugar and salt. they were a big hit. i made them instead of cranberry sauce for thanksgiving."
256795,59885,2009-01-09,5,"VERY yummy!  My hubby loves onions any way they come, and when balsamic vinegar is included, it's all the better!  Thanks for sharing!  :O)"
220348,59885,2017-10-29,0,"These were so good and so filling that it was the only side dish we needed. There were some leftovers, and were easily warmed after a couple of days, but it wasn't the same."
430471,215284,2007-04-30,5,This was fun. My DD (almost 3) and I made these as a snack.  I'll have to do again and get a photo.  She helped spread the PB and she put on the raisins and  dried cranberries. So we had red and black ants on our stumps.
537188,141810,2008-07-01,5,I love these!!! They are lovely and moist and the spices go well with the banana. Its a nice alternative to banana bread for using up bananas. Thanks!
1052873,449215,2014-04-13,4,This was easy and tasty but the avocado added a slightly off color and a slightly slimey texture. I had plain yogurt so added a little vanilla. Made for PAC 14.
189280,179522,2006-10-24,3,"I chose this for the Fall 06 PAC event.  It  is a good, basic mac and cheese that's easy to make.  I used pre-shredded colby-jack cheese and my paprika was sweet smoked paprika.  Next time I will use a little more seasoning.  I served this with buffalo chicken strips, broccoli, and salad - which was a very nice combination."
41578,179522,2007-02-27,5,"This is comfort food at its best.  You just can't beat it on a cold night.  I used cheddar cheese and we love it!  Thanks for sharing, Panhandle Sam!"
1061795,179522,2008-12-07,5,Brilliant base for mac-and-cheese. My girlfriend and I love it.
2256062,179522,2012-05-04,4,I thought this recipe was really good! the only thing i thought that could of been better was more cheese! overall really delicious!
488713,179522,2013-05-10,1,Waste of time and money. It was super bland and had ZERO flavor. I used 1 1/2 cups of cheddar and 1/2 of Monterrey jack cheese. If I could give this recipe zero stars I would.
2383576,179522,2014-02-21,4,"Two stars as written, four with my adjustments. 1) ADD SALT. 2) Jack up the pepper a bit. I doubled, then doubled again. 3) Instead of paprika, use a teaspoon of mustard powder or a tablespoon of dijon mustard. With those changes, this was a great base mac and cheese recipe, one I&#039;ll definitely play with to make variations like buffalo chicken mac and cheese or bacon ranch."
57601,57572,2003-04-06,5,"Chia, this is very good.  I love blueberries and the banana/blueberry combination was excellent!  Perfect for breakfast or brunch!"
27783,57572,2003-12-11,5,This bread has a delicious flavor.  I love the combo of blueberries with the banana.  Very buttery.  Accurate to the minute.
107651,57572,2004-01-25,4,"This is good! I used 3 very ripe bananas and frozen wild blueberries,  baked in time specified,  most tasty!!!!!"
61660,57572,2004-01-27,5,"Very good bread!  I used 3 bananas and some frozen blueberries.  I will try 4 bananas next time I think.  The bread was moist and flavorful, the blueberries are great with the banana.  I had to cook mine 10 minutes longer, but I was using a stoneware loaf pan for the first time, so that may have affected the cook time.  Thanks for this one chia!!!"
85414,57572,2005-08-14,4,This is a very good recipe. I've made it as bread and as muffins. It makes about 18 medium sized muffins -- baked mine at 375 degrees for 25 minutes. I prefer to use frozen blueberries and mix them with the dry ingredients before stirring into the wet -- helps the blueberries distribute evenly and avoids over-stirring.
168921,136939,2005-09-20,4,We love hash!
88099,136939,2006-06-07,4,"This was really good, however I didn't make as directed.  I fried the bacon and sausage separately.  Then fried the potatoes and when they were browned added the bacon and sausage back in.  Left out the onion, personal preference.  Then I made small holes to place the eggs in.  Used additional eggs.  Very nice, but next time will leave out the sausage as a personal preference.  Thanks."
37449,54276,2003-03-12,5,"This was just great! I usually use similar toppings, but to mix them together and have ready to put on is a great idea! Thanks for making life just a little easier!"
51011,54276,2004-11-21,5,"Yum! I made this for my dh, because he LOVES loaded potatoes, and I had green onions I needed to use.  Super simple and tasty!  Thanks for sharing- I would have never thought to mix them all together for later use."
138429,113402,2006-09-22,5, Easy and quick and delicate they are. These are delicious. Followed the recipe as stated and made no changes except that I greased the cookie sheet. When placed under the broiler they must be watched very closely so they don't burn. Will be making them again soon. Thanks for this great recipe.
4470,54276,2008-06-23,5,This is delicious!  I made it up ahead of timeand refrigerated it until dinner.  I used Cottage cheese instead of sour cream.  When the potatoes were baked I split them open filled them and put them bak=ck in the oven for 5 monutes  Heavenly!!!!! Thanks LAURIE for a real winner
305531,54276,2009-10-25,5,"Yummy! Great idea to mix everything together. I don't usually add cheese to my baked potato, but it was really good. Thanks LAURIE for a nice new keeper. Made for Cookbook Tag."
550518,240260,2007-08-01,2,"These weren't too bad, but definitely don't burn them.  It ruins them."
1790661,359975,2011-04-01,5,"Thank you for posting this, I saw it also on Eating well and tried it - FABULOUS!!!  I was so happy to save it for future use :)  We had it with salmon and it really was a delicious twist for asparagus."
329769,359975,2012-08-17,5,A great way to cook asparagus that we served with pan-grilled chicken. Super easy and gluten-free too. Reviewed for ZWT8 visit in India. Photo also to be posted
135470,359975,2012-08-24,5,This was a simple and tasty side dish I served with Salmon Tika. I used my cast iron frying pan and kicked up the heat to give the asparagus a little bit of char. The lemon and curry are great together. Made for ZWT  by one of The Wild Bunch.
85018,382447,2010-05-12,5,These are wonderful!  And so much easier than making a pan of baklava!  Made this for Book group meeting and didn't come home with even a crumb!  Followed the recipe to the letter--will be making this again soon1
121185,382447,2010-05-15,5,"This was great!  I picked up what I thought were phyllo pastry shells - but there were only 6 to a box, they were Pepperidge Farm's Puff Pastry Shells.  You also needed to bake these shells before filling them.  So, I baked for about 15 minutes, pulled them out 1/2 done, pulled out the center of the pastry, filled them with the pecan mix (I only used pecans) and then baked them for another 15 minutes.  Then I drizzled about 1 T honey on each.  They were SO good!!"
215851,417252,2010-03-25,5,"Made this the other night to take with me to a dinner party.  The dip really went well with the asparagus.  Everyone raved about it and there wasn't an asparagus spear left on the plate.  Best of all was how incredibly simple it was to make.  Will definitely make it again.  I used fresh asparagus as I don't care for the canned taste.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe."
282673,206978,2007-06-04,5,"i made this yesterday when my MIL came over for brunch. we all loved it, and she took home the leftovers. the combination of ingredients might sound a little odd but they end up blending so well! i made some minor modifications: used coleslaw mix, doubled the curry powder, and since the peanuts i had were unsalted i added a very small amount of celery salt. i definitely will be making this again!"
528100,206978,2007-07-01,4,"Found the recipe this morning, threw it together for a family potluck this afternoon, crossed my fingers and lucked out!  Lovely combination of flavors and textures.  This was SIMPLE to make with bagged shredded cabbage and precooked bacon.  I'm not sure that shredding the cabbage or frying bacon myself would improve the recipe so I won't bother when I make it again....and I WILL make it again!"
286566,475313,2012-05-20,3,"This recipe was one that went between 3 and 4 stars but we had problems, I could only fit 9 apples into the pan and because of the pan I used (the only one I had of the right size) I couldn't go over 190C fan forced which I think wasn't hot enough to really cook the pastry properly, though browned it was still undercooked (though it looked good when I took out of the oven, even allowing an extra 5 minutes and also our pastry sheets where a little on the small side to cover the dish so had to stretch a little. would buy the block of puff pastry to use in this recipe in future).  Our other issue was I used Gala apples as suggested but they were a little mushy to the taste (we like a firm taste in our apple) though they did hold there shape well, so would also look at a different variety to suit us.  Still enjoyed with a dollop of cream. Thank you Boomette, made for Please Review My Recipes."
25792,74421,2004-09-20,5,"Sharon this is a great, simple recipe.  The directions are simple and if you had a basic knowledge of canning this would be a cinch to do.  I am making this again only this time in quart jars and with some oregano and garlic added.  I did use mostly fresh basil also.  If you are a first time canner just make sure to have your jars clean and steralized and hot, and to keep your water boiing while processing. Also dont tighten the lids tight when boiling or you could have a mess!  Good basic sauces recipe!!! Thanks. "
52543,74421,2005-09-13,5,"A great basic sauce recipe for the novice canner or an old pro like me! I only got 4 500 ml jars but my food scale may be a little off or my sauce is a little thicker. 
There was a wee bit left in the bottom of the pot which I taste-tested after it cooled - delicious & definitely worthy of 5 stars. Thanx Sharon!"
58762,9518,2002-11-09,1,ummm...is this even a recipe?

This is the simple recipe, that sometimes we forget about! I agree with making sure you don't over microwave the sandwich! "
156653,9518,2004-10-13,5,Ha Ha- My mom use to make this for me ALL THE TIME! She called it a Ju Ju Bee Sandwich (named after yours truly!) It was one of the few things that I would eat when I was younger (I was a picky eater!) Thanks for posting it to the public!  ps-MISS YOU MOMMY!!
171724,9518,2004-11-10,5,"I make this often.I toast the bread first and then it is just like a grilled cheese sandwich. Lower
in calories cause you aren't using any butter"
1535,9518,2004-11-10,5,"DH makes these all the time when he wants a before-bed snack. He usually makes them open-face though. I prefer a traditional grilled cheese sandwich but I give this 5 stars because, to me, they mean I don't have to get up and fix him anything!!! :oD"
181879,9518,2004-12-22,0,"i made this for my sister when she was little, and she loved it.  I eat them too now when i'm lazy and hungry"
125266,9518,2004-12-29,1,I raised my godson on real grilled cheese sandwiches-rye with extra sharp cooked in seasoned iron skillet. His mother followed your recipe. Now he is enrolled at the Culinary Institute of the Arts. Is this just adolescent rebellion? I attribute it all to various methods of the grilled cheese dilemma. 
213547,9518,2005-07-14,5,"If you can't figure out a sandwich like this, you shouldn't be looking at recipes in general.  No offense, but these seem to take up more space than it is worth. "
115853,9518,2005-08-17,5,"I've made this for years! I've gotta give it 5 stars for simplicity and nostalgia. :-) My friend and I made this as a quick snack before we were allowed to use the stove. (Don't even ask how long ago that was.) We dubbed it the ""Microwave Cheese Sandwich."" One thing we learned is, do NOT cook over 30 seconds or the bread will get hard/chewy as it cools. Also, I've noticed certain brands of bread are better for this. Merita is excellent, if you can get it. Sunbeam gets gooey for some reason."
140028,9518,2006-02-28,5,LOL I used to do this a lot! Thanks for the reminder!
179133,9518,2006-02-28,5,"I do this all the time when I want a quick ""grilled"" cheese sandwich - and no butter needed so lower fat & calories than the real thing. Even better if you have a toaster oven to melt the cheese because the toast stays crispier. Thanks for sharing Harry! :)"
130663,9518,2006-02-28,5,This was fast and lower in calories. Very good.
250309,9518,2006-02-28,2,microwaving makes the bread gross and it doesn't really make it any quicker than using a skillet.
172169,9518,2006-03-01,3,"My apologies, Happy Harry, but the m'wave makes the bread real soggy and chewy, as if it had been dipped in fondue. Sorry for the 3 stars."
242929,9518,2006-03-02,0,"We used to do this for kids at the daycare I worked at. It didn't taste as good as the original, but it is lower in fat and the kids loved them!"
122235,9518,2006-03-05,1,"I tried this (with toasted bread) when I got my first microwave years ago.  The cookbook that came with it included this recipe.  I thought: how bad could it be?  Unfortunately, the  answer is: really bad.  It is SO worth the minimal effort involved to grill the sandwich, even if that does add some grams of fat, at least the results are edible."
289860,9518,2006-03-06,2,"Make it a 90 Second Sandwich by toasting the bread first - and you've got a winner.  PLUS, use more than one miserly slice of cheese!

I've made ""grilled"" cheese sandwiches this way for years and like the lack of added fat.

"
193516,9518,2006-03-07,5,"I used to have this daily when I was young. I still enjoy this, with light old cheddar cheese on occasion today.  It's a great way to change up a plain cold cheese sandwich.  Best of all it is extremely quick and tasty! :)"
208136,9518,2006-03-11,5,This was college staple food for me! I made them even less like a grilled cheese. I used to put it in an open baggie first before putting it in the microwave so that the bread would get really soft and the cheese would melt better. I then microwaved it for only about 20 seconds. The bag and the shorter time seemed to help keep the bread from getting hard. Ham added to the sandwich is nice as well.
322326,9518,2006-10-01,5,"this is just how my gran gives us our cheese sandwichs, though she adds a slice of ham and a bit of chutney, very good."
37036,9518,2007-05-04,5,I've been eating cheese sandwiches for years.  I normally add a thin layer of mayo.  Great on the go sandwich!
43083,9518,2007-11-12,4,I have made this sandwich many a times..especially when I was younger and my cooking skills were not the same as they are now:) I used to do it when I didnt feel like making a grilled cheese..
286665,9518,2008-08-12,1,"I donâ€™t mean to be disrespectful, butâ€¦this isnâ€™t a recipe.  This is however, one of the laziest excuses for a grilled cheese sandwich Iâ€™ve ever seen.  I will conclude by saying this, if â€œafter a night on the tilesâ€� as you put it, this is the best you could do, then you might consider rehab! Ha-ha!"
206385,9518,2008-08-13,5,"I make this exact sandwich, with one exception, to go with a large glass of ice cold milk.  The only thing I do different is I do not microwave.  It's just perfect before or during a busy day!"
359220,9518,2008-08-13,5,"This ""non recipe"" got me through all of my teenage summer days; only I ate it for breakfast while watching TV (oh- those lazy days!).  So yummy and works well on any type of bread- sliced sandwich, bagel and english muffins for instance.  Mmmm!"
533612,9518,2008-09-19,1,"An extra few seconds could make this better in several ways. Calling this a recipe is quite a stretch. Search for ""grilled cheese"" and do yourself a favor, the extra time, and pat of butter, are well worth it."

135566,42242,2008-02-04,4,I was pleasantly surprised that this shake had more of a pineapple flavor than I anticipated.  I thought it was really good and will make it again!
60260,56376,2003-04-29,5,I thought this was quick and easy to make and a nice side dish.  Really watch the baking time - my tomatoes weren't that large but they needed to be cooked a bit longer.  When tomatoes are at their peak this summer I plan to makes these a lot.  Thanks for sharing.
27643,56376,2003-07-07,5,I had one large tomato to cook for the two of us. It took about 20 minutes to cook. Worth every minute! We really enjoyed this simple way to make a tomato very tasty! The Parmesan cheese gave a good bite to it. We'll be having these a lot this summer. 
82648,56376,2003-12-15,5,Very tasty! I loved it! I used 1 large tomato for the 2 of us and it needed to be cooked for 25 minutes in order to be cooked sufficently. Wonderful! Excellent side dish.
64642,56376,2004-02-04,4,Very nice.  Very tasty.  Very easy to make.
60989,56376,2004-08-25,4,"This was very good. The seasonings really help bring out the natural sweetness of the tomato. Next time I make these, I will de-seed my tomatoes first, and double up on the parmesan and oregano because we wanted more flavor. . "
121193,56376,2009-07-04,5,I changed the 1 tsp. of oregano to 1/2 tsp. and I added 1/2 tsp. dried basil.  I also drizzled the tomatoes with olive oil before topping with the cheese mixture.  So delicious!
427184,56376,2011-08-15,5,"Fast, easy and delicious! This is a keeper for sure. Thanks!"
653438,56376,2011-12-06,5,Delicious!  Made for Holly Jolly Diabetic Forum and followed the instructions except for using a little more parmesan cheese.  I used roma tomatoes which worked out well.  DH and I really enjoyed them and I will be making them again.  Thank you.  Served with recipe#198822#198822 and recipe#305974#305974.

162098,376227,2009-07-01,3,"I really wanted to like these, I just didn't.  Maybe it was just the texture."
209603,376227,2009-07-07,3,"these were pretty good and very healthy. i didnt put in all the oil but subbed some for prune puree and put chocolate chips instead of raisons. after the second cookie you get hooked. and i love that there is no flour in them. they dont rise or move much, so make it the shape you want before baking. also 25 min was WAY too long for mine. i cut it down to about 15 or less. so watch em."
2018061,376227,2011-09-26,5,"So delicious! I don't really care for walnuts and the kids don't like raisins, so I used sliced almonds and dried cranberries instead!  I could have eaten them all myself :)"
37449,33676,2002-10-21,5,"Karen, these were just lovely, all golden brown and the batter was light and tasty. I dipped them in coctail sauce. Yummy. Thanks!"
201392,33676,2005-07-19,0,I think that this recipe may have an error in the amount of liquid to be used. We made this batter and it turned out much like dough. We added and extra 3/4 cup of milk to thin the batter enough to dip the onion rings.
215000,33676,2006-05-04,4,Karen this batter rocks! my husband was craving onion rings with our hamburgers and this really hit the spot thank you! I did add a bit more milk and i added some paprika these were great thank you so much
250206,33676,2006-08-29,5,Good batter! I added 2 more tbs. of milk.  Yummy!
255338,33676,2006-11-11,5,"My first onion rings, and my kids loved these. Thank you for sharing. Will make these again."
1535,33676,2007-06-05,3,"While the flavor was good, we didn't like the breading. It was too thick and chewy. We prefer a lighter, crisper breading. I had to add about 1/4 cup more milk (I used buttermilk) since it was like paste without it. I think it would have been even better if I had added an additional 1/2 cup milk. With it this thick, a lot of it stuck to each onion ring. I was only able to coat one onion worth of rings. I don't see how it could ever coat 6 onions."
1328779,33676,2009-07-19,2,"Batter was way too thick, had to add about 4 more tablespoons of milk. For a cripser ring, keep them in the oil longer!"
2842658,33676,2014-09-08,3,This batter was just okay -- too thick and got soggy very quickly. I tried it again substituting beer for the milk to no avail. I will keep searching for the ultimate onion ring batter!
2000672040,33676,2015-11-12,2,"Listen. These are not very good. I mean i guess they get the job done, but they have no flavor. None. It&#039;s like tofu on an onion. And it&#039;s soggy. I may as well just did flour and water."
2000980102,33676,2016-04-20,4,It was easy enough but the batter was a little too thick and bland
2001941873,33676,2018-01-19,5,"It was great, even though I had to add other seasoning to make the batter Less Bland before making this I saw other peoples reviews about it , so I did take the recipe but I also listen to what other people think so yes the results were very delicious , and it’s my first time making onion rings so that was everything"
49304,96968,2004-10-14,5,"Oh My Gosh, this is a delicious Marinade for Tuna Steaks. I made it just like you stated in recipe, mixed all ingredients in plastic bag added the tuna and marinated for about 30 minutes before grilling the tuna. DH said, this is the BEST. I will defintely be making this again and will try it with other fish & shrimp"
87023,96968,2004-12-04,5,"Made this for shrimp, which I just had for lunch.  An excellent recipe and I am sure it would be great with any kind of fish.  I marinated the shrimp for about 2 hours then grilled them."
52448,96968,2005-02-24,5,Excellent.. Hlaved the recipe.I used it for large tiger prawns as a starter/appetizer. Served it with sprinkled with green onions and chopped chilies..thanks!
37449,96968,2005-04-13,5,I marinated some salmon for about 2 hours and broiled it. Lovely flavors. I did add a little hoisin with the leftover marinade for a touch of sweetness. Thanks for a yummy dinner!
219979,96968,2005-09-28,5,A wonderfully simple marinade with so much flavor!  I marinaded some shrimp that we skewered and threw on the grill.  Goes great with some angelhair pasta!
196320,96968,2006-08-19,5,"This is a 5-STAR recipe all the way!  I didn't have any scallions on hand, so chopped up some fresh chives from the garden and used that in the marinade.  Used jumbo shrimp (raw, peeled and de-veined) and marinaded for 2-3 hours.  Used wooden skewers and grilled for just 3 minutes per side....perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor!!!"
259150,96968,2008-02-22,5,"Perfect!  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks, what a delicious marinade for tuna."
333017,96968,2009-05-31,3,"I am on the fence with this one.  I marinated prawns, but unfortunately, I pulled out the wrong bag and they were 51-60 count.  Maybe if they were a bigger prawn they might have bbq'ed up better!  Everyone liked them...but I was expecting something a bit more from this sauce.  Maybe if it had some garlic in the marinade there would be a more of a pow to it!!!  Sorry I am ""odd man out""!"
857489,96968,2009-06-29,5,"This was so tasty on tilapia! To make this 5 star, I added grated garlic-2 cloves, white pepper and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I marinated my fish for a couple hours in the fridge. I served it with jasmine rice, King Hawaiian rolls and skewers of grilled baby carrots-yum! I will use again, I think orange juice is one of my favorite marinade ingredients for fish! Thanks!"
734479,96968,2009-06-30,5,"This was really good! I used it on shrimp for shrimp tacos, Mmmmm."
28455,56581,2003-05-16,5,"This is so delicious and refreshing!
I made it for my lunch today and everyone at work wanted a bite.
I did use a ruby red grapefruit and mmmmmmmmmmmm is all I can say!
Also I used low fat mayo and didn't miss a tatse at all.
Thanks Golfwife for a great summer salad!"
63108,56581,2006-01-11,5,"This is my new favorite salad.  The first time I made it I only had romaine lettuce and it turned out great!  The second time I made it, I ran out of lettuce so I used spinach and substitued poppyseed dressing for the mayonnaise...fabulous!  Thank you a great recipe!"
11461,56581,2007-03-01,5,"I cannot believe I found this recipe!  I hadn't thought about it for years.  I lived in a sorority house at UCLA in the late 50s, and this salad was served there upon occasion.  I think canned grapefruit was used for this.  The slices of grapefruit were alternated with slices of avocado and a trail of Thousand Island dressing (mostly likely) was drizzled down the middle of the slices nestled on a bed of shredded lettuce.  It was delicious, and everyone loved it.  I even served it at my home when I got married and had people over for dinner.  Very simple and absolutely delicious!  I'm sure fresh grapefruit would be even more delicious.  Thanks for bringing back a lovely memory!"
1116375,56581,2009-01-19,5,"I remember this from the 1950's --  made with the bottled orange French dressing. Just as good now, but I like the idea of spinach and poppyseed dressing. Should go well with my egg casserole for brunch (or dinner)."

Creamy enhancement to any seafood. Thanks for posting!"
463435,375504,2012-11-20,5,"So simple, and yet so very tasty. Living at my MIL (hopefully a very temporary situation) my families diet has changed drastically. Fresh veggies are not the norm. When I came across this recipe today, I knew I had to have it with vegetables... So for lunch today I sliced up a red bell pepper and a celery stalk. The dressing was fabulous on both. I can't wait to try it on a nice salmon filet or other piece of fish. Unfortunately that will have to wait a while as MIL will only allow canned salmon or tuna in the house :("

305531,372659,2009-05-25,5,Yum! This was really good. I love roasted garlic and the kitchen smelled wonderful while this was cooking. I tried it with some cream cheese and then Recipe #295413 which was really great too. Thanks Realtor for a great new keeper. Made for ZWT5 2009.
678857,372659,2009-09-30,5,"Thank you for an easy method to roast garlic.  This recipe is sure to be a family favorite and the garlic roasting method will be used for many other recipes.  Made and enjoyed for PAC, Fall 2009.  Thanks!"
43466860,330954,2014-04-29,5,This is by far be most lovely frosting I have ever had the pleasure of making.  I made a few changes...I added more almond butter and used organic vegan palm shortening and WOW!  Excellent recipe!  And what a fabulous change from all the other &quot;regulars&quot; like chocolate or vanilla.  I recommend this recipe!
37449,78331,2009-12-20,5,Yum! I really enjoyed this sweet and sour dish! I love Brussels sprouts and this was a new and great way to eat them. Thanks! Made for the Bargain Basement game.

83093,205712,2008-03-23,5,"First off, forget that drizzle, dip, dressing and sauce business and just go ahead and drink it. ;-) It's that good!  I dunked a strawberry in some; great of course.  I dolloped it on a piece of warm, recipe #209214.  Heaven! But the best bite of all was straight out of a spoon! The taste is hard to describe; close to that of a cheesecake but the texture is more like a mousse.  Unfortunately, I only made half a recipe so I have it hidden for tomorrow when DH is at work and I can eat it all.   The cornstarch and juices took about 10 minutes to thicken up. The texture really changes with the egg addition. It gets thick and bubbly looking. After cooking the egg mixture a couple of minutes, I added the chunks of cream cheese (lowfat) and stirred it into the hot mixture. This gets pretty thick when cooled so to make this a 5 in 1 recipe, add to your list that I think it would make a terrific pie filling.  I can hardly wait to experiment more with this nectar. ;-) Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
315565,205712,2009-10-31,5,This is delicious. I served with recipe #392200. I used very thick WW sour cream instead of cream cheese and with whisking it all came together beautifully. Made and enjoyed for Zaar Cookbook tag
187373,226796,2009-11-22,4,"This was an easy to make, good tasting soup. I made a half recipe and used a russett potato in place of the red since that's what I had and added a little salt and pepper. I also used the immersion blender before adding the cheese and sour cream.   Made a great, light lunch!  Reviewed for the Bargain Basement tag game."
1484796,226796,2009-12-18,5,"Delicious!!! This was my first attempt at a home made soup, and it turned out very well. Everything came out perfect, but I did end up adding some seasoning to taste. Made a wonderful dinner for my family during a really cold night! Served it with garlic bread for the total meal."
436388,226796,2011-05-15,5,"This recipe was very easy to put together,  has a wonderful aroma while cooking. I too blended the soup once cooled down. Can't wait to eat!   I will definatly share this with my co-workers."
2000106859,226796,2015-04-01,4,Really enjoyed the soup. I added a little salt and pepper and switched the sour cream for plain Greek yogurt. I also blended the soup before adding the yogurt and cheese.
1052873,226796,2015-09-20,5,"This was yummy. Pureed the asparagus and most of the potatoes. For leftovers, added a little whipping cream and 1/2 cup bacon, cooked and diced."
424680,205712,2011-04-24,5,"Outstanding! I used this only as a dip this first time around, but after [1]recently making a chocolate pie & [2]reading SusieQusie's review from several years ago, I've decided that my next go at this recipe will be to make it thicker & use it as a second & top layer for a chocolate pie!

What a nice change of pace from the usual treats that usually show up at gatherings.  I made two batches, the first exactly as written and then the second batch I used Amish Peanut Butter (a mixture of peanut butter and marshmallow cream).  Both ways were excellent.  Thanks for sharing this treat, SoozieQ.  It's a winner!"
526666,225494,2011-01-02,5,"OK, so I cheated, and made this for myself, but, boy am I glad! :) Delish! And easy, so I'll keep this one in the 'lunch' file for sure. I used crunchy peanut butter, as that is what I had on hand, but I think it would be better with creamy. Thanks so much for sharing, Sooz Cooks!"
546010,225494,2013-01-22,5,"I grew up on this yummy stuff! We served it as a snack w/o the butter, but as they say, I'll bet butter makes it better!  If you like salty peanuts, you will love this tasty treat!"

125388,147790,2008-03-15,5,Great recipe when you crave baked beans and need a quick last-minute addition to a meal.  I used slightly less horseradish because I didn't want the flavor to overpower.  It turned out great.
461724,147790,2008-10-01,4,"I loved these, but DH didn't care for them.  He doesn't like sweet relish, so I cut the amount in half, but he was still able to detect it!  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Game."
40103,8562,2003-11-15,3,"This is a nice, very basic way to serve acorn squash.  It is suitable for those who like squash on the sweet side, without complicated flavours.
   i'll post my slightly more involved recipe, but this versions a keeper for kids and others who don't like more seasoning."
4470,8562,2005-02-09,5,Love the brown sugar - I confess that I added a teaspoon of butter too. Using a fork I mashed the squash  in the shell. Baked it for 1 hour (it was a bit large).  Looked attractive and tasted great- Thanks Sarah for posting
565663,8562,2007-09-29,5,"This was a very nice basic recipe! I've never cooked acorn squashes before, and this gave me an idea what else is possible with this squash -- a great place to start with!"
627758,8562,2007-10-27,5,"Excellent. We're up to our ears in squash, because we get all our veggies from a local co-op and squash just reufuses to go out of season. It's nice to find simple but tasty ways to cook it that the kids don't revile."
626995,8562,2009-10-28,5,"This is super simple but very comforting and filling (and cheap!). We added a little butter along with the brown sugar and ate the squash directly out of the shells. Great, easy recipe."
359220,8562,2009-10-29,5,"This is how my mother would prepare acorn squash when I was a child, except that we didn't mash it together- so yummy!  Now as an adult, I prefer to steam them in the microwave (much faster) then put a little dab of butter inside the well along with the brown sugar and eat it as is."
343789,8562,2010-02-19,5,"This was very good and very easy.  I only had one squash that we got from a veggie co-op so I made it up for lunch instead of dinner (wanted to make sure we liked it before I made a dinner with it).  It was wonderful.  Even my niece who swears she hates squash of any kind, liked it.  Thanks for sharing."
1833965,8562,2011-03-30,5,I added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon as well as the brown sugar and enjoyed this as a pseudo dessert. I don't know why I never used to eat squash... it's so yummy.  :)
16758,8559,2001-09-04,1,it is not that good its watery would not make again she must have forgot some thing in the ingredients
27381,8559,2002-06-02,1,"Sorry, I agree. This is way to soupy to be called chop suey. I drained off the liquid and then had to spice it up a bit with more soy sauce and pepper. I served with rice instead of bread."
57232,8559,2002-10-10,1,I think she forgot to add some cornstarch to make it thick and more soy sauce  :)
356127,8559,2010-04-28,5,this recipe is basicallly great-only thing i did differently was to thicken the broth-i added 1-tlb-cornstarch -to boullion before adding to rest- and found the recipe great ?i served this on rice -thanks dear for your entry=
21752,24850,2002-04-29,5,"Having been abandoned last night by my entire family (can I help it if they all have other plan?) I decided to comfort myself and indulge in a little (or a lot) of garlicky cauliflower.  I used my own mix of spices, including some red pepper flakes and a little curry powder.  A must for lovers of cruciferous foods!  Thanks Bergy, another keeper!"
27443,24850,2002-06-26,5,"Served this when my sister visited, didn't know her husband hated cauliflower! He had 3 helpings before he asked what it was. For the life of me I don't know what he thought it was as he was eating it, cause it looked like cauliflower! He told my sister he still hated cauliflower, but if she wanted to make this he'd eat it:)"
5060,24850,2002-07-25,5,"Bark!! Bark!!  Bark!!
This is one lovely recipe for anyone that loves garlic!!!  Didn't change a thing, except to cut it back for two.  We will be barking again soon, thanks for a keeper Bergy!!"
35526,24850,2003-04-24,5,We both enjoyed the cauliflower.  We usually prepare it by just steaming it or eating it raw.  Thanks for a great recipe.  
115621,24850,2004-01-12,5,"Bergy... this is a real winner no doubt. I love garlic, but never tried it on cauliflower. I love this and will make it often... I know this one will go with my Vegie recipes. Thanks again!!! glitter"
89420,24850,2004-01-14,1,"I love cauliflower and was really looking forward to fixing this dish, however, it just did not turn right.  Maybe I made a mistake, but I followed the recipe step by step.  There was not enough oil to toss the cauliflower with, so I ended up adding some butter hoping it would work out, but it did not.  Sorry, I would love to give this a good rating, and I am sure that others enjoyed it, but it did not suit our taste.
I really feel bad about this, but I have to be honest."
130661,24850,2004-05-09,4,"The garlic and herbs make the cauliflower great! Instead of bread crumbs, I used 2 tbsp wheat bran + 1 tbsp oat bran. I also added 1/16 tsp red pepper to ""kick it up a notch"". Whatever you do, don't cut back on the garlic! Rave reviews from my husband!"
41809,24850,2004-05-29,5,"This is a neat way to fix an old favorite!  I followed your easy directions, and came up with a very nice side for chicken. I did cut the recipe back a ways as there are only 2 of us here, but, it sure didn't hurt it!
Thanks for sharing your ""barky"" cauliflower, Bergy! We really enjoyed!  Laudee"
116856,24850,2005-03-23,5,The bread crumbs didn't all stick to the cauliflower but it was still great and gave some flavor to the cauliflower.  Will be making this one again!
27678,24850,2005-05-22,5,Woof woof Bergy! This is great cauliflower. Cauliflower can be so bland but the crumbs add a nice texture as well as a lot of flavour punch. Easy to make too. Thanks for yet another keeper!
217482,24850,2005-07-28,3,"I made this as a snack when my kids said that they were hungry one day.

They ate with no complaints! They must have liked it!

Both my kids love their vegies, so they probably thought this was a fancy way of having them."
117880,24850,2005-11-06,4,"Made this for my family. My husband ate his up, and he doesn't eat cauliflower and my 5 year old who doesn't eat vegetables ate his up before asking what is this? It's not the most attractive looking dish, but its tasty."
960426,24850,2008-09-18,0,"This was a great way to prepare a vegetable that doesn't usually excite me.  I, too, had problems with excess bread crumbs, but I'd definitely make it again.  Yum!"
358796,24850,2008-12-27,5,"Not sure what ""barking"" means here, but the flavor was good! Microwaved my cauliflower in a pyrex dish with saran for 6 minutes until tender crisp. Next time, I'd use 2 slices of bread but other than that this worked great and loved how the flavored breadcrumbs stuck to the cauliflower."
63024,24850,2009-09-01,5,"Whole wheat bread crumbs were perfect.  While steaming the cauliflower, I sauteed the garlic with the bread crumbs until slightly browned.  Then I removed the crumb mixture and sauteed the cauliflower, until slightly browned, which gave it a wonderful flavor.  Since, trying to find recipes to use herbs, this was perfect."
131021,24850,2010-04-08,5,"This was so good. i love cauliflower and garlic so it was a match made in heaven. I steamed the cauliflower in the saucepan then took it out and put it in the serving bowl. I sauted the rest in the saucepan including the store bought bread crumbs( I was in a hurry) and then added the cauliflower to the pan to warm it up. I will be making this again, yum."
86359,24850,2010-04-25,3,"Flavor was good, but crumbs did not stick to the cauliflower. Do not think I will make again.  Whats the flavor without presentation."
298981,24850,2013-04-07,0,delicious!!  We usually eat cauliflower just steamed (which we love) but this was really nice for a change of pace.  Even the picky 10 year old gobbled it down!!
2000431901,24850,2016-01-08,5,"Amazing wonderful recipe! I used my pressure cooker to steam the cauliflower for just one minute. Then I put all the oil in to cook the garlic, and stirred in the crumbs and herbs, then stirred the steamed cauliflower into it in the skillet. Don&#039;t expect the cauliflower to be coated in oil and crumbs. Little bits stick to the cauliflower and give it a lot of flavor, but you also have lots of separate bits of crumbs that don&#039;t stick. This is a good thing! We ended up standing over the bowl of cauliflower and eating it with our fingers, dipping it into the crumbs. Will definitely make this again and again."
57479,50276,2003-03-01,5,"  I made this over the weekend for a vegetarian Atkins dieting guest.  My family also loves artichokes so this was a real plus.  I used frozen artichoke hearts and cut them in quarters.  My kids asked that I don't use the thyme next time, but I thought it was perfect."
78405,50276,2003-03-18,4,"This recipe was very good except for the very strong onion flavor. Insetad of using 2 large onions, I think next time I am going to use 1 small onion. The onion was just a little over-powering for me."
511821,50276,2007-07-04,5,sorry I forgot to add that i did not boil the garlic i just peeled it and cut it and I did not have white wine vinegar so I used red and it tasted great.
337963,150513,2011-01-19,5,"I love this recipe, especially as an easy, make-ahead breakfast.  I'll make it Sunday night, then we just pop each bowl in the microwave for breakfast during the week.  I've noticed the flavor gets even better the next day.  I'm cutting the molasses and sugar in half, for my diet, and it's still delicious - just the right combination of spices.  It cooks in about half the time in my oven.  Thanks for a great recipe Ellie!"
1159440,441744,2013-07-15,5,"Great substitute for the canned stuff. Fast and easy, too."
1072593,58454,2012-06-12,5,I'm wondering why this hasn't had a review since 2003.  Check your armpits.  No...no smells?  There's GOT to be a button around here somewhere to click that makes a recipe jump out onto the front page.  Made for My 3 Chefs.
2001569938,58454,2017-06-05,0,I made this salad today. It was delicious and such a light refreshing little salad. I did tweak it a bit and used spring onions and a little garlic. Will definitely do it again.
58104,174553,2006-12-21,5,Great comfort and cooling soup. So easy it`s great for on the run. I didn`t use heavy cream use low fat in place of the milk.
104295,174553,2007-02-10,4,A very nice sweet soup recipe.  Definitely needed to chill.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Used all fat free ingredients.
590105,174553,2008-06-19,5,"Wonderful!  My bananas weren't very large, so I just used 2 cups milk and no cream.  I delivered it to the 1-year-old and 3-year-old as ""banana milk"" and they *loved* it!  We will probably have this again tomorrow!  Thank you!  Reviewed for ZWT4."
80353,174553,2008-06-23,4,"Easy and tasty can best describe this - oh and rich!  The cream is just the right 'magic' touch, and the nutmeg essential.  We enjoyed this like a smoothie."
527886,174553,2008-06-27,0,"Banana-y and creamy. Unfortunately, I let it sit several hours in the refrigerator, and the bananas had started to darken, even with the lemon juice."
361931,174553,2008-07-01,4,"Reminds me more of a smoothie than a soup -- but very good!!  Rich and smooth.  The thought crossed my mind of freezing this into popsicle molds, so might try that soon :)"
344231,174553,2008-07-01,4,Very yummy and refreshing!  Will make again when I have a house full of kids. (-:  Made for ZWT4.
573325,174553,2011-05-02,4,"This was a nice cold soup with a great fruity flavour. It was quick and easy to make and the taste was very refreshing. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of plain nutmeg and liked that a lot. Also I left out the heavy cream as I thought it would be too rich for breakfast (which is when I ate my soup).<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing your recipe with us, Sharon!<br/>Made and reviewed for Zaar Stars April 2011."
593927,174553,2012-04-05,4,"Tastes good. I prefered eating it with a spoon rather than sipping it from a cup like a smoothie. It is a soup. Tastes best chilled so be sure to do that. I used homogenized milk, Carnation evaporated milk instead of cream, allspice in a lesser amount in place of nutmeg as we do not consume intoxicants, & freshly squeezed lemon juice. Made for Yummy, fun for a change which I made gluten free!! DD1 (4 years old) and I enjoyed them and I plan to make them again for DH. I used brown rice flour, white rice flour and tapioca starch for the all purpose flour (half the amount of starch to flour), homogenized milk, sweet butter (unsalted), bananas mixed into the brown sugar, and Balkan (thick) yogurt to be corn free. I'd say this make 2 large servings not 4 as you don't cut the pancake in half. I will make this recipe again. Made for Veggie Swap #45 ~ April 2012 ~"
959796,325336,2008-10-05,4,My kids really liked it.  Sort of like Kettle Corn with a twist!!
281399,325336,2008-10-23,5,"Awesome popcorn.  The ratio of pumpkin pie spice and sugar was perfect. It did taste like kettle corn with a twist.   I used a 100gram bag of microwave extra butter flavor popcorn and it turned out great. It was gone in a flash. Thanks for sharing this recipe, one I will be making again."
790350,325336,2009-01-06,4,"I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used Garam Masala from McCotmick's Gourmet Collection which is a combination of spices including coriander, black pepper, cumin, cordamom and cinnamon (I added extra cinnamon too).  Also, I use Splenda Brown sugar blend.  Make sure you use fresh spices &  break up the clumps of brown sugar.  Thanks for the snack idea!"
1189556,325336,2009-04-02,2,"This wasn't for me, but I love the idea."
230860,325336,2009-10-07,5,My son and I really enjoyed this!  I had to use a simple microwave popcorn due to my son's allergies so I added a bit of melted dairy free margarine and then the spices and it was great!
131126,325336,2009-10-27,5,I enjoyed this quick to make snack.  It fits fall perfectly & I appreciated a new idea for an under used spice in my pantry.  Thank you for sharing the idea!
1679305,325336,2010-09-07,5,"I haven't yet tried this recipe but i do believe with these spices it would do well in a popcorn ball. Just an idea, let me know if it works."
353937,325336,2010-10-18,5,Great hit with the kids.  Perfect for the Fall.
2002114765,528364,2018-04-15,0,regular oats or instant?
1058097,443310,2011-04-19,5,"It's kinda messy to mix, but it definitely gets the job done!  Thanks for posting."
1466337,443310,2011-08-09,5,I thought I had already reviewed this.  I've been using it since you posted it and it's wonderfully easy.  Thank you!
29196,44741,2002-11-03,4,"This is a very simple and tasty recipe, and we enjoyed it a lot. Make sure you keep shaking the pan after step 5 as the peas can catch and scorch very easily."
56112,44741,2004-04-15,4,"This is a really quick and easy side dish.  I was worried that there way really no liquid added, but it did work out just fine.  I took JanS's advise and stuck close to the pan during step 5 and everything was fine.
"
101732,44741,2004-04-21,4,I really enjoyed these peas!They were easy to put together and very tastey.Thanks!
8629,44741,2004-06-24,4,Very flavorful. I really enjoyed this side dish.  Good instructions.
212609,289570,2013-04-13,4,"Everyone should master the basics..especially when it&#039;s as simple as this, and produces such lovely results.&lt;br/&gt;I would be careful about your choice of bread though.....I used French initially, which crumbled a little when being rubbed with the garlic. Ciabatta was more robust and took it much better!&lt;br/&gt;Made for Spring PAC 2013."
1120777,140487,2009-03-21,0,"I added a little more sugar, used half-and-half, and used a lime's worth of juice. Great basic recipe!!"
163112,174555,2007-01-29,4,"Fast & fabulous.  Very healthy, too.  A smidge heavy on the cinnamon but still excellent.  THE PICKY ONE wants unstuffed dates in the cinnamon syrup, lol.  DH & my little one will be thrilled with my latest discovery.  Thank you for posting this, Sharon!"
293410,174555,2009-05-22,5,"These sweet, syrupy-glistening morsels of heaven will have you eating way more dates than your RDI of sugar allows! I absolutely loved them. I subbed agave nectar for the honey and actually halved the amount (as well as the cinnamon), which seemed to work. Sticky and spicy and nutty- I munched a lot of extra nuts with mine! Thanks for posting!"
542159,174555,2011-05-30,5,Lip-smacking! What a tasty natural candy. Like the way the cinnamon and pepper add warm under tones to the sweet dates and honey. Made as written. Thanks for the post.
143721,174555,2011-06-08,5,OH MY GOODNESS these are GREAT.  I like dates plain but this recipe is heaven.  The cinnamon and pepper really adds to the flavor.  Thanks for a new snack recipe.  Made for ZWT7 and the Saucy Silverados.
58104,96727,2004-08-10,5,"
There is NO way this can last 2 months in the fridge! Two of us ate it in 2 days! But wait I did cut the recipe down to fourth of what it calls for. As you see in the picture I made it on bread in the oven. The oil came through the bread making the bottom soft, rich and yummy and the top was gooey, crisp, garlicky, and salty. Being it called for so much garlic I used the crushed jar garlic. I hardly ever use it. It `s in my fridge for emergency `s. This would be great on a home made pizza, in Quesadillas, top a meatloaf with it, Or blend it into your favorite baked pasta. This is a must make. Yes I was foolish not to make the whole recipe. A keeper!"
128447,96727,2004-09-13,2,"If you want to keep everyone you meet 20 feet away from you, just eat a piece of this bread.  I like garlic, but OH MY GOD not this much.  Sorry, I would never make this again"
176615,96727,2005-01-02,5,"Very good, cheesy bread. I cut the recipe down to 1 pint and used it on a loaf of Failproof French Bread #81211, sliced, then broiled until melted. Like Rita L, I used bottled minced garlic which was very convenient though I may actually increase the amount next time. I really liked that this is made with olive oil that has a lot more health benefits than butter, and the oil sinks into the bread for a wonderful flavor. Everyone loved this, even the kids. My fridge is jammed, I may make some more to store in the freezer. Thanks, C in PA for a super recipe!"
191436,96727,2005-02-04,4,"Very good spread recipe! I think next time I will leave out the lemon juice. I did not care for the lemon taste so much but the garlic was heavenly! I am making this for company tomorrow night.
Thanks!"
104600,96727,2005-05-02,5,"This was definately GARLIC bread...  but everyone wanted 2 jars.  Now I'm getting calls to make more...  If you LOVE garlic, ya gotta try this one.  Thanks for a great recipe.  By the way, it's even better after being in the refrigerator a couple of days."
131126,96727,2005-05-12,5,"I reduced the amounts to make 1/4 of the recipe.  We were very pleased with this cheesy, very garlicy spread.  It melted well on french loaves.  I did add dried parsley flakes to the spread for some color. Thanks for sharing your recipe.  "
36944,96727,2005-06-14,5,"This is so easy to make and tastes delicious!  It stays great in the fridge and I think it gets more flavorful the longer it sits!  But don't expect it to last very long.  It doesn't have to be just a bread spread..try it on veggies, omelets, tortillas, soften it a bit in the microwave for a quick appy to spread on crackers. Thanks for sharing your recipe C in PA!"
113117,96727,2005-06-23,5,This was delicious and so convenient. I tried on Ritz crackers while I was waiting to bake the bread and it was awesome.  Thanks for such a great recipe.
187276,96727,2006-06-13,5,I belong to the canning group where this was posted and have been making it for several years.  Have people begging me to make all the time.  Wonderful!!!!!
213114,96727,2006-09-26,5,Yum! I used fresh minced garlic when I mixed up a jar of this. I made some french bread and topped it with the spread. OMG! It was wonderful served with Sausage Gumbo. It could always be made with less garlic for someone who wants a milder garlic taste. mmmmmmmm
276718,96727,2006-11-15,5,"Made this yesterday and haven't even been able to make garlic bread out of it yet!!!  First tried it on crackers; yummy, garlicy, addicting.  Then I used someone elses suggestion and mixed it into my meatloaf mixture.  The whole house smelled wonderful - my DH even said he could smell it at the end of our street!  He thought that was the best meatloaf he ever tasted, even better than his mothers - now thats saying alot!  I quartered the recipe since there is only the two of us.  Thank you for posting!  Can't wait to try it today as garlic toast and leftover meatloaf. 10/20/06 Finally made the garlic bread and it was wonderful.  Baked it then broiled it so the cheese was a little toasted.  Great garlic recipe.11/15/06 Last night I put this on top of some canned spinach and broiled it, awsome!"
614976,96727,2008-03-02,5,"Made this yesterday for a birthday party and served it with spaghetti. It was one of the first things to go at the table. It was very easy to prepare and tasted great. I made one before hand in my toaster oven to see if it needed anything extra, but it was just right. I think the mixture of the 3 cheeses gives it the perfect flavor -- i love how i didn't need to add any salt. I added extra garlic and i left out the lemon juice. Great recipe, thanks!"
131021,96727,2009-06-20,4,I made about a 1/5 recipe but I let the computer do the calculations and they were a bit funky-1/5 of 1 cup is not 1/4 cup or garlic-. I didn't realize this until later so I will probably try it again. We did like it a lot it was just too strong. I love that if you don't use it all you can store it for a while.
114681,96727,2009-12-05,5,Real nice.  Cut the recipe to 1 pint.  Looked like a lot but really wasn't on a loaf of French Bread.  Two of us inhaled it.  The EVO made a different taste from the usual butter.  Like the bread dipping oil.  The lemon juice also contributed.  A keeper and maker again.  Thanks for sharing.
526666,96727,2009-12-09,5,"OK, I know how to keep the vampires away! LOL This stuff is great! I reduced the recipe, but I could see making the full recipe up, serving for a dinner with friends and handing them a jar of this on the way out the door! I enjoyed the flavors, and think that the lemon added a bit of brightness. Thanks so much for sharing, C in PA."
192264,96727,2009-12-19,5,Yummmm! Great flavor & easy. I don't think this will last long at my house! Thanks for a good & easy recipe.
140132,96727,2010-01-29,5,"What a great bread spread!!!  I made this, only to realize I only had half the amount of mozzerella called for so added monterey jack cheese also.  Great recipe!!!  I loved this as did my family.  I will make this bread many times.....thank you so much for sharing this with us."
305531,96727,2010-04-09,5,"Yum! This is so easy and so tasty! I only made 1/4 of the recipe for 2 of us, but now I think that I'll make it again and always have on reserve. Thanks C in PA. Made for Cookbook Tag."
1102893,96727,2011-03-20,5,"Definitely very yummy. I used a coarsely shredded mozz, I think it would be more spreadable with finer shreds. That won't stop me from using up this original batch, and going on for more!"
851405,96727,2011-04-08,5,"I can't believe I forgot to review this.  This is really awesome.  My kids love it.  I make it every time we have spaghetti or lasagna. I've even made one night while watching a movie.  It reminds me of the Rockefeller bread that the Fish House Vera Cruz in San Marcos, CA serves minus the spinach."
179133,96727,2011-12-07,5,Wow is this garlicy (not that that's a bad thing!) I quartered the recipe and had enough for 2 mini baguettes. I had to use shredded romano not grated so added a little extra. I also used half fresh garlic and half pickled garlic (it was from recipe #263732 - I didn't want to waste it and wasn't sure what else to do with it!) Went great with the black bean soup I had for dinner. Thanks for sharing!
178427,96727,2011-12-27,5,Wow!! This was awesome. I made one pint as there is only 2 of us. I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. It was perfect. Next time I plan to make more so I can share with friends. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.
88099,96727,2012-01-20,5,"Very very good.  Great combination of cheese flavors, but I will cut back just a little on the Romano cheese next time as I personally thought it was a little stronge.  I made only a third of the recipe and have plenty for lots of bread.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Best of 2011 tag game."
68884,126396,2005-11-10,5,"I made these into cupcakes for a baby shower. This turned out moist & flavorful. The batter is thick, as I assumed it would be, but beating it the full amount of time makes it quite smooth. The cupcakes baked up in 20 minutes exactly. Thanks :)"
237154,126396,2006-06-06,5,I loved everything about this recipe. From the ease of preparation to the wonderful taste. It is super moist with a nice light taste. I also made this into cupcakes and it worked well in that form. For the frosting I used recipe# 95416 and it worked well with this. This will be my go-to recipe for cupcakes. Love it! Thanks ocurt!
115853,126396,2006-10-28,5,"Fantastic cake! I made this for DD's first birthday and she devoured her piece and then demanded a second. Really! The batter is quite thick, but I agree that beating it for the full amount of time produces a very smooth result. I made this a couple of days ahead of time, storing it in the fridge, in order to have ample time for decorating. It was still deliciously moist for the party and several people commented on how good it was."
549460,126396,2008-03-04,5,This makes really good cake and it's what I always use for my white cakes now.
619508,126396,2008-03-15,5,Moist and delicious.  This cake baked up nicely in a round pan and cupcakes.
570804,126396,2008-09-07,3,I appear to be in the minority in my rating of this cake.   Was quite disappointed because I made it exactly as stated but it still tasted like a cake mix - even after allowing it to sit overnight. I guess we just do not like the aftertaste of a cake mix.  I am glad it worked for others and that they enjoyed it - maybe I am being picky!!!
284180,126396,2008-09-18,5,This is a very good white cake as a base for recipes such as Recipe #209312.
189325,126396,2008-12-18,5,"I don't typically use a cake mix, but was in a hurry to get a white cake made to use for a frozen ice cream cake.  I thought it turned out great!!!  I layered ice cream that I had previously formed to the same size pan that i baked the cake in.  Put fudge topping on the cake before topping with ice cream.  Covered the whole layer cake with cool whip and then put chopped heath bars on top.  I did that so the wrap wouldn't stick to the cool whip.

The cake didn't freeze too hard.  It had great texture and I used this recipe again even when I had more time."
1503508,126396,2010-03-25,3,I am not sure if I did something wrong or what.  I made cupcakes and ended up with 18.  I found they turned out very dry .  I am not sure if I over baked them or what.  I was very disappointed.
1375473,126396,2010-05-09,0,I can never say no to a great white cake!
1570472,126396,2011-06-26,5,"This cake was just as beautiful as it was delicious!  Easy and excellent recipe!  However, if <br/>you are covering it with fondant, I would recommend using a more dense cake recipe.  Still a terrific recipe!"
1574486,126396,2012-05-05,5,"I made this cake just as the instructions say and it was great! It is a very dense cake, almost like a pound cake, but extremely moist. This will be my new go-to white cake recipe."
1911882,126396,2013-05-21,5,This recipe makes a very moist and yummy cake! I made cupcakes for my daughters birthday and through in some colored sprinkles to the batter to make confetti cupcakes Adorable! I will use this recipe again!
1375354,32843,2009-09-06,5,"This was incredibly easy and delicious.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and 1T caraway seeds.  Rather than chopping the onion, I cut it in half and thinly sliced it.  The soup was wonderful both with and without a dollop of sour cream."
2000733581,32843,2015-12-07,5,"I made this today, with modifications:
Added in a little coconut oil(solid not fluid) in place  some of the butter.
Instead of flour, I used a tablespoon of ground chia.
Caraway seeds and 1/4 cup fresh chopped fennel were added.
Added in some cubed, left-over ham to compensate for low sodium broth used.(No additional salt was needed)
I also used a great deal more cabbage than the 2 cups.
The soup came out very rich and creamy.
If you don&#039;t like creamy, omit the chia.

This is really a fantastic base recipe for so so many veggie based soups.  Enjoy!"
2001389676,513221,2017-02-12,5,"I have never made steak on the stove or in the oven, and this was FABULOUS! Thank you for a great recipe, it made my day!"
435019,126396,2013-09-08,2,"I don&#039;t know what i was expecting, but this cake just didn&#039;t work out for me. It was dry, vaguely sour tasting (probably from the sour cream) and we were disappointed. I think i will just go back to preparing the white cake mix as directed on the box."
1803080479,126396,2014-11-11,0,I bet this is great.   Every baked recipe I&#039;ve ever tried with sour cream seems to be lighter than any other version.  I find it to be a perfect ingredient to bake with.
2001590409,126396,2017-06-18,1,"This was not a successful &quot;doctoring&quot; at all. I made this just as specified. I used a white cake mix, the 3 whole eggs turned it yellow. The sour cream addition seemed to do nothing for moisture--it was less moist than making the mix using the directions on the box! Seems like it's missing water. Overall it was a big disappointment, though it did have a vanilla flavor, that was it. It even browned on the bottom more than a regular boxed cake mix cake usually does--adding to the dryness. :("
54325,49930,2003-09-11,4,YUMMM....I topped this off with vanilla ice cream..
136997,391349,2009-10-06,4,"I really like the flavour of sesame oil and was looking forward to this recipe. Although you get the hint of the oil on the potatoes, I wished it had been more pronounced. I will experiment and add 2 tbsp. oil next time. Made for Every Day Holiday Tag. :)"
653438,391349,2011-10-17,4,Made this last night to go with Rachel's Baked Pork Chops#458891 and your recipe Quick Mixed Vegetable Medley#334261.  I did use red potatoes (that is what I had) and added a little more sesame oil as Lori Mama suggested.  I feel it still needed some spice or something but we still ate all of them.  Thank you.  Made for Fall Pick-A-Chef 2011.
52990,47096,2002-12-01,5,"Yummy and the easiest fresh berry relish I could find.  I added chopped apples, and next time I will add raisins also during bake time!!!"
177443,47096,2005-04-20,5,We enjoyed this. Thanks for a keeper. 
41984,47096,2006-11-21,5,I made this as written last night.  I couldn't wait to taste this so I tasted it as soon as everything was mixed in.  My first thought was that there was too much lemon juice.  I tried it again later and I guess that the marmalade had melted more and it was so good!  I think that toasting the walnuts adds a lot to this recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!
199198,47096,2007-11-19,5,Made this for a Thanksgiving dinner at church. It disappeared quickly! I'll be making this for our own Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks!
126104,47096,2007-11-21,5,"I cut this recipe in half--BIG, BIG, BIG MISTAKE.  The good is that I can get more cranberries Friday.

This was scruptious, hot out of the oven.  I did substitute Splenda for the sugar, but used ""full strength"" marmalade rather than sugar free (I'm diabetic).  I have no idea what the carb count is on this, but I really don't care.  It's just sooooo good.

I was going to make another side dish, but since it's just me, it's:  turkey, dressing, a baked sweet potato and this relish.  I am going to be one happy camper tomorrow.

Thanks, Terri, for my new favorite recipe."
339260,47096,2007-11-22,5,"I usually make a different cranberry relish recipe that is cooked on the stovetop.  I wanted to try something new, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  This is a very easy recipe to make and the orange marmalade give it a great orangey taste.  I also added a peeled and chopped apple which gave it a little extra crunch.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, Terri."
1206083,47096,2009-12-02,5,I made this fast and easy recipe for Thanksgiving. It was a real hit and will become a part my Thanksgiving menu from now on.
381180,47096,2009-12-30,5,"This recipe is so easy and is delicious ~ and I learned it is very important to COVER the baking dish!  :)

For Christmas 2009, I made the recipe again with the added one teaspoon orange oil, and 1 1/4 cups brown sugar (not packed tight) ~ I forgot to cover the dish while baking, which resulted in less sauce, and the cranberries were more candied ~ I added the toasted walnuts and orange marmalade, and the juice of one large lemon.  

* * * * * First review:  For Thanksgiving 2009, I made this per the recipe, but added one teaspoon orange oil to the cranberries before baking ~ it was delicious, but a little too sweet!"
287850,47096,2012-08-06,5,I've used a recipe similar to this.....here's mine.  All I add to the cranberries is the sugar and a half cup of brandy (or more if desired) then bake as posted.
101732,249683,2008-11-20,5,These were very good carrots! Since only 2/4 of us in the house will eat carrots I had to scale down the recipe. Very simple with great results!! They complimented Recipe #331131 very well. Thanks so much for posting! Made for My 3 Chefs '08.
857580,249683,2009-01-10,5,"A miracle occurred at my house last night. My husband, who has to be forced to eat any veggie that is not either fried or baked in a casserole with cheese, ate SECONDS! Of a healthy veggie! Five stars for that alone."
973916,249683,2009-06-04,3,"I made these last night, and wasn't thrilled. I could barely taste the balsamic vinegar, I felt they were under seasoned, and they weren't visually appealing. I also found that they needed 30 - 35 minutes to roast to be tender. My boyfriend said he liked them; however, I will not be making this again."
1122319,249683,2009-10-10,4,easy. pretty good. I did cook for 40 min.
315084,249683,2010-01-18,5,"It is unusual for me to rate a 5 on a veggie recipe but this one is outstanding.  It is flavorful, easy to prepare and compliments your other courses well.  I served with grilled steak and twice baked potatoes and cherry pie for dessert.  We loved them and will make them often. Thanks for posting such a tasty recipe"
1736962,249683,2011-01-18,5,Easy to make and these have great flavor.
1963920,249683,2011-07-22,5,"I made these this morning to have for lunch, but cooked them a little longer than suggested.  My husband loved them!  He doesn't care for balsamic vinegar, so we left it out.  Said they taste like sweet potato fries!  Said this is the only way he will eat carrots from now on!  I agree!"
83093,190648,2007-05-03,5,"I love compounded butters and this is no exception. I made as written after having a party in my herb garden. I picked parsley, garlic chives, thyme and even  a sage leaf for interest. I paused near the rosemary and dill but decided that might be overkill. ;-) The butter is all whipped up and twiddling its thumbs in the fridge waiting for the breadmaker to do its job.  Thanks for yet another great recipe!"
125388,190648,2008-01-27,5,"So far, I've only tried this on hot French bread, and it was really great.  The herbs work well together, no flavor overpowers any of the others.  I froze the remainder and look forward to using it in the future."
168556,190648,2008-07-17,5,"Great recipe, very easy to make.  Goes great with hot bread as well as steamed veggies.  I've also used this along with some parmesan cheese mixed into couscous.  Works well with everything I've tried so far.  Seems to keep nicely in the freezer."
157425,138330,2005-12-06,4,"Nice casserole, quick and easy. I did sprinkle a bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top right before coming out of the oven. Good side dish for pork chops!"
67656,138330,2006-11-27,4,"I goofed a bit on this.  I grabbed a boullion cube as a quick substitute for chicken broth and unbeknownst to me it was beef flavored boullion not chicken.  Nonetheless, the dish was flavorful and satifying - sort of like a beautiful barley rissotto studded with herbs and veggies.  It was also WWCore, always a plus in my book.  Thank you for sharing."
169430,138330,2007-01-05,4,"I made this for National Soup Month in Zaar Holiday Tag. I made it in a 3 serving size and used 5 cups of chicken broth and doubled the seasonings ask for in that serving amount and simmered instead of baked it. I must say that it really makes a great soup. I had a small amount of leftover chicken breast in the fridge, less than 1/2 a cup, so I diced it up and tossed it in basically to use it up. As soup, the bit of chicken was a nice addition. This made a hearty, satisfying and tasty soup that even my picky DH ate a huge bowl of it. It looked like toni's pic except it was swimming in broth. A very good,and adaptable, recipe. Thanks for sharing ElaineAnn."
37779,138330,2009-05-23,4,"I had some barley that I needed to use up and am glad I tried this recipe. Has great texture and balanced mix of ingredients. Made a filling, tasty, healthy lunch along with side salad. Thanks for posting."
498271,138330,2011-01-04,5,"This is a wonderful dish - pure comfort food that's healthy too!  I don't care for onion so used chopped celery instead, otherwise made just as directed.  Served as a meatless main dish, with some sauteed zucchini and a small salad, and enjoyed a hearty healthy meal - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
485109,138330,2011-01-25,4,"Really enjoyed this healthy side dish! I added a courgette/zucchini I had in the fridge which went with the other flavours very well. It ended up being in the oven for an extra 15 minutes but I added a little extra water and it didn't suffer for the extra cooking time. A filling, healthy side dish that we'll try again with some different vegetables and maybe beef broth. Thanks for sharing this very flexible recipe!"
352845,138330,2011-02-05,5,I really liked this recipe.  It made a really good side dish and then it made a really good lunch.  The texture of everything was really good together.  It would be a good side dish with almost anything.  Very delicious and satisfying.  Thanks for sharing!
165933,138330,2011-02-10,5,"Wow.  I made this as a side last night and it was fantastic.  I've been looking for different ways to use barley, other than soups, and this was perfect.  I added left over chicken and 2T of chia.  Next time I'm adding some mushrooms!  Thanks for a wonderful dish."
187373,138330,2011-04-15,5,"Good, different side dish.  Was a great use of barley, which I'm trying to add more of in my diet to mix it up a bit.  Will make again!"
653438,138330,2011-11-08,5,Delicious!  I made this as directed and served it with recipe#467300#467300 and recipe#206818#206818. Going into my Favorites of 2011.
383206,138330,2012-01-04,5,"Very, very nice. Attractive, kid friendly, healthy, easy, & not the same-old-thing. Had to change cooking method as I was preparing dinner ahead. Cooked my barley (regular, not pearl) with low sodium chicken broth in the rice part of my steamer. Sauteed the rest on the stove with the herbs, (had only dried parsley) added the corn (partially frozen) and a bit of water to speed up the softening. Mixed with the barley when done and.. WOW. It was great. Will add to regular rotation."
937635,138330,2012-01-13,5,"What a great healthy recipe! I have the hardest time finding a good side for pulled pork, but I finally realized that it should be healthy and not macaroni & cheese-y. I could only find the Bob's Red Mill hull-less barley, so I pre-cooked it for 40 minutes and then continued the recipe. It came out soupy, but firmed up right away. Excellent recipe. So glad you posted it!"
424680,138330,2012-01-20,5,"Made & served this very tasty side dish as given in the recipe! We definitely enjoyed the combo of corn & barley & I'll be making this one again, maybe taking a tip from another reviewer or two & adding some of the shredded or chopped chicken breast that I always have in the freezer! This is one great keeper of a recipe! Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in the Best of 2011 tagging event]"
440324,138330,2013-09-24,5,It looks fantastic and it tastes even better! Thank you for sharing.
329769,472507,2013-07-18,5,Reviewed for ZWT9- I really liked this modern twist on tzatziki. The avocado gave an extra dimension to this lovely refreshing sauce. Served with recipe#503941 for a lovely Greek vege lunch. Photo also to be posted
37449,472507,2013-07-24,5,Great flavor and I liked the texture too! Made for team Hot Stuff for ZWT#9-2013.
114027,472507,2013-07-27,5,"I loved this as well. The blend of flavors was really nice and it has held up very well in the fridge. Made for The Hot Pink Panthers, ZWT9."
128473,472507,2013-10-20,5,"Amazing Tzatziki recipe Tisme.  This recipe got my tzatziki hating hubby to enjoy tzatziki.  Kudos to you my dear panther.  This tzatziki was perfection, it had a great silky texture and a lovely flavor.  We really enjoyed that the tzatziki was not overpowering in anyway, you could taste all the different ingredients in this dish. I really loved how easy it was to prepare.  We will be enjoying this treat often.  It has been placed in my Favorites Cookbook for 2013."
197984,110342,2005-02-23,5,"This was very easy, but kind of messy to make. Mine came out wonderfully!!! They tast like a cross between an omlett and a fluffy pancake. They really don't need syrup although when I first saw the recipe I thought they might.  This is a lot more food than I expected too, so have more than two people to enjoy it with."
256115,110342,2005-10-28,5,Fantastic. We ate this in Austria. Thanks for the recipe - it tastes even better.
18391,110342,2005-11-09,3,"I am sorry to say we did not enjoy this recipe .. it wasn't as good as I expected it to be, but the instructions are very clear and straight forward .. thanks for sharing!"
407338,245950,2007-08-13,4,"Good on top of rice, but I found it lacking a little something.  Therefore, I added a teaspoon each of vinegar and sugar which helped.  I only used half the amount of bacon grease.  Thanks for sharing."
159145,125039,2005-08-04,5,"So simple and so elegant.  This was a great way to end to end tonight's dinner.  I made one tiny change, used Brown Sugar Twin instead of regular brown sugar.  DH said ""Those were really good, honey"" and I know we will be having them again soon, while plums are ripe.  Thanks for posting!"
234062,125039,2009-05-31,4,This is really fantastic! I was blown away by the flavours. The only thing that I would change is that I'd bake the plums so that they can be a lot softer. I think that would improve the recipe. The syrup and icecream combo is phenomenal though!
354196,349598,2009-01-15,5,Very moist and very yummy. Made these last night and they are gone already.
131674,349598,2010-05-27,5,What a great simple 5 ingredient recipe!  These came out very moist.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for 1-2-3 Tag.
693345,349598,2010-06-18,5,"These were so easy to make, very good, and it was awesome that there are so few (common) ingredients! The only things I did differently were sub half whole wheat flour and half fat-free mayo; otherwise, I made exactly as posted. Mine were done in 25 minutes, and the mayo in the recipe reminds me of Mayonnaise Cake that my husband loves so much. These were really good, and I would totally make them again. Thanks for posting! Tagged for 1~2~3 Hit Wonders."
279989,349598,2010-06-22,5,"These were great.  DH loved them.  So easy to make.  I used to make a mayonaise cake when I was a teenager, so making these with mayo brought back memories.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for 1~2~3 Hit Wonders.  June 2010."
169430,349598,2010-08-18,5,I have to say that I'm really amazed by this simple recipe. It has just a few ingredients and one step - mix!. Even so it delivers incredibly moist and delicious muffins. The mayo gives an almost creamy taste and the texture is very soft and fluffy. That great taste is so richly full of banana that it puts to shame some recipes that have a lot of ingredients and ask for banana extract to pump up the flavor:D. I used Splenda for the sugar and half fat mayo.
1542289,349598,2010-08-19,5,"WOW!! These muffins are AMAZING! Very simple and very easy. First time baking muffins at all, and I will be sticking with these forever. Kids loves em, I loved em, and DH loved them and thats all that matters. Thank you so much & I hope more people make them so you can keep getting these ratings!"
869184,349598,2010-08-22,5,"These muffins are INCREDIBLE, not to talk about EASY! I have never before used mayo in baking - I used light - and the texture is so moist and yummy. A keeper for sure - thanks for sharing!"
226863,349598,2010-09-11,5,"So easy to make and delightful!  I used half regular mayo and half light, and they turned out wonderfully.  I took mine out of the oven a bit early, so they sort of sunk in....but were delicious regardless.  I'll make these again!!"
157425,349598,2010-09-13,5,These are wonderful muffins! I had two large bananas that I broke up and put in my KA mixer along with the other ingredients. Whipped the batter together in no time and made 24 mini muffins that everybody loved. Next time I make them I will froxt with some cream cheese frosting. Moist muffins that taste great and very easy to make. Thank you Pink for sharing this recipe! Made and reviewed for KC's Recipe Tag Game.
1072593,349598,2010-10-10,5,"I'm a rockin', apron wearing, muffin bakin', dinner bubbling in the oven, pots washed, caffeine loaded cook...and I'll save ya a few crumbs."
526666,349598,2011-02-17,5,"Great muffins! They were moist and tender and simple to make...(first thing in the morning, that is good!) I followed the recipe, as directed, and was rewarded with 12 delicious muffins! I may add some walnuts, next time, but they were great, as is! Made for the Best of 2010 tag game. Thanks for sharing, Pink Diamond!"
369715,349598,2011-03-29,5,These were real easy to make and so good. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I only got 10 muffins and mine didn't look the best but they sure did taste good. There is so much banana flavor. I will make these again. Hubby loved them too. He is on his third one!
346670,349598,2014-11-16,0,"I have been making these muffins ever since I first saw it here back in 2010! Over the years I have learned the batter mixes better together when you mix the mayo and bananas together first, then add to the dry mix. I also have added lemon zest and blueberries to the mix. So yummy! And, this mix also makes two yummy loaves of banana bread! Oh, and a splash if vanilla in the mix is good too! I also do it as written, this recipe is soo freakin good!"
2000441897,349598,2015-08-30,5,"Great recipe!  Made a dozen and they were gone in 30 mins.  My family of 4 says this is the best banana muffin I have EVER made and we make &#039;nana&#039; muffins almost every Sunday.

I made one substitution: I used 2tsp baking powder (dbl acting) when I discovered I was out of baking soda.  

I added blueberries which was perfect!

Thanks for an amazingly easy and delicious recipe!!"
2001278358,349598,2017-05-04,2,"I was eager to make these muffins, since so many reviews were positive. But mine were a little mushy in the middle. I don't know if I did something wrong."
130663,234039,2009-04-18,5,"These were so tasty,will make them again."
735705,234039,2009-09-08,5,"Made these tonight and these are impressive, indeed! I wasn't sure about the flavors when I first mixed them together but once they started cooking it was smelling great in my kitchen! My husband said he could make a meal on these alone. Very tasty. A different twist on onions and we do love onions just about any way you can fix them. This was a nice change--a fancy onion if I may say so.  Made for PAC Fall 2009."
35635,140488,2007-05-03,5,"Worked perfectly, just the right consistency to drizzle with. I made half a recipe of this to drizzle on Recipe #183836. Delicious."
222139,140488,2007-05-13,5,Made this to go with Recipe #183836.  As my family stated this was a nice topping to add to it.  Good choice.
1922012,454944,2011-05-31,5,"This was delish!<br/>I cut back on some of the spices in half of the fish (my hubby isn't so adventrous) but both the non-spiced and spiced were great!<br/>I didn't make the fries and instead had the fish on some corn tortillas and salsa for fish taco, and it tasted fab!<br/>Definately a keeper!"
1922034,454944,2011-05-31,5,"I loved the breading to the fish; it was light, crisp, and flavorful (I especially loved the creative use of yeast) My hubby couldn't stop raving about it, thanks!"
197023,142305,2006-03-25,5,"Potatoes and leeks: a winning combination, and I just loved the addition of all the other ingredients. A truly wonderful soup! KelBel's Tuscan Soup Recipe #94089 was one of the first recipes I found on Zaar - and I've made it some half dozen times since then - and this recipe has now joined it in my favourite soups cookbook. Thank you KelBel for sharing yet another yummy soup recipe! 
"
164368,142305,2007-12-28,5,Really yummy. The only thing i did differently was to use the pot I fried the bacon in to create the soup (I wanted to get all the nice little crispy pieces of bacon). I also added celery & carrots-just can't seem to make a soup w/o adding those 2 ingrediants.  Thanks for an easy pot-o-soup. DELICIOUS!
1399270,142305,2009-09-30,5,"So good. I made this soup again tonight, and it's delicious. It's like a hug from the inside out."
1420969,142305,2009-10-21,5,Delicious soup!  The only change I made was to puree the leeks...or I would at least chop them up a bit.  Wouldn't change any else.
2480333,142305,2012-11-03,5,Wonderful recipe!!! My family loved it.
254614,71866,2006-06-07,4,This is a good recipe. Basic and good with a spicy grilled steak!
2528348,142305,2012-11-26,3,This tasted great however I found the instructions Really vague.. The store I went too had 3 different sizes of leeks.. It says just add 3... And it says 8 potatoes... well what sues potatoes and what type? I ended up usei g russets which where a bigger potato and after the cream went in it was still way to thick.. It was almost the consistency of mash potatoes I had to ad double the cream and another cup of broth... I followed the recipe exactly.. So I concluded there was to many potatoes in it... Which means that I bought potatoes that where to big... And the store had even bigger ones.. It would be better if u did the potatoes by volume or weight or state what size and type.. But other than this... Amazing simple recipe
241696,142305,2015-10-04,5,"I found this recipe to be exactly what was needed on the first cold, rainy day of fall!  Another reviewer mentioned that they had a difficult time making this as they weren&#039;t sure what size of potato to use. Most recipes will state 1 lb or 2 cups , etc , but I found by putting the 4 cups of liquid into the pot first and then adding enough peeled, quartered potatoes until they were about 1&quot; below the stock did the trick. I used 10 small/medium size russet potatoes and also used chicken stock instead of the broth, as It&#039;s a personal preference for me. I find stock had less salt that most broths and cost just the same.  When the potatoes were done I used a potato masher and then added the carmelized leeks to it. (I did not add the crispy bacon) After 5 minutes I used an immersion blender and added the cream, which resulted in a velvety smooth soup that was AMAZING.  I served the soup with little bowls of toppings and allowed my family to pick and choose their own. The toppings I put out were the crispy bacon pieces, shredded extra sharp white cheddar, chives, fresh Parmesan cheese and green onions. Most of my family choose the crispy bacon and cheddar!  Delicious!!!"
52543,59593,2004-01-12,5,This is not only FANTASTIC but its also the FIRST pound cake that I ever made! It was an easy recipe & the cake was very moist. I will NEVER buy another pound cake at the store. Thanx Lori! 
153188,104844,2005-04-07,5,"Has been made, haven't tried it yet, but it smells fantastic!"
58104,104844,2005-04-29,5,This will stay stove side along with a couple of other seasonings I use daily. I did use 1 tablespoon hot paprika ans 2 tablespoon sweet paprika. Followed the rest of the ingredients. I took Baby Bam and made it Mommy Bam not quite Daddy Bam! Good Stuff! Thanks for posting!
1535,104844,2005-05-03,5,My son got one of Emeril's kid cookbooks for Christmas last year (autographed too!) and this recipe is in it. We've used it several times in his recipes. We especially liked the Baby Bam Burgers.
136918,104844,2005-11-23,5,Makes just about anything taste better. I went with the 1/4 t. of cayenne pepper in mine and ground it all up using a mortal and pestle for easy sprinkling from an empty spice bottle.
173579,104844,2007-05-13,5,Very nice rub.  Thanks for posting.
204024,104844,2008-10-06,5,"Never heard of ""bam"" before but this was wonderful.  We used it to make Recipe#316002 for PAC and marinated some little sirloin steaks in it.  Luscious!"
620627,104844,2008-11-08,5,"I have made many batches over the years. I use it to season up EVERYTHING-burgers, french fries, you name it, it's there."
653438,104844,2011-05-28,5,Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag to use on our hamburgers...very very good.  I also added it to some oven fries.   Quite handy to have.  Thank you.
1968178,104844,2011-07-27,0,I sauteed fresh Lake Erie Perch filets using 2 T in  1 1/2 cups of flour and it was the best!!!!!
168921,104844,2013-06-09,5,This is good. I made this to use in Oven Corn Dogs # 142681.
1020526,353290,2017-01-08,5,"Mmmmm. Delicious, buttery goodness. Thank you Bay Laurel for the fabulous breakfast."
1072593,404868,2009-12-29,5,"There's the good, the bad and the unfathomable. Would you believe even the grandkids ate 'em?"
1350389,404868,2009-12-30,5,Beautiful recipe if you like sprouts or not. Added sliced garlic in the butter after I turned the heat off - excellent.
1503452,404868,2010-01-07,5,"I HATE Brussel sprouts, but this recipe had me returning for a second helping! I did add a little olive oil and lemon juice for additional flavor. And, I used sea salt, as opposed to table salt. This is destined to become a weeknight side dish staple in my house. Delicious! Thanks Chef Dean #2!"
180406,404868,2010-01-11,4,"Very good! I would have given them all five stars but the brussel sprouts were different sizes so some got done and others didn't. The flavor was excellent, though. I did add 2 cloves of garlic just because we love garlic! Thanks again for the recipe."
1603293,404868,2010-06-27,0,Needed a brussel sprouts recipe and found this one. I added garlic and really enjoyed these with roasted pumpkin and potatoes! YUM! Kids really liked them too and will def have them again! Thanks!!!!!
869184,404868,2010-12-22,5,"These really are awesome! Super fast, simple and tasty! Thanks for sharing and thanks for the laugh when reading the 'about the recipe' section."
227978,237760,2009-10-12,4,"This was so simple to prepare, and it is a really good bread pudding.  I decided to have it for breakfast this morning, and it worked out because it's not an overly sweet dish.  I didn't add anything like raisins or anything beyond the main recipe ingredients, so maybe that had something to do with it not being very sweet.  But if I served this for dessert, I would definitely add more sugar and vanilla, to sweeten it up a bit.  But all in all, it's a good bread pudding.  Thanks, PrimQuilter."
593424,237760,2011-02-25,5,"I have made this adding peaches the first time and blueberries the second.  They were both delicious!  I just sprinkled extra sugar to taste over the mixture and mixed it in before baking.  Served it with freshly made whipped cream for dessert, then ate for breakfast for several days, which was a real treat!"
2894124,237760,2013-07-08,5,"Added extra sugar, vanilla, and raisins! Delicious dessert."
236556,152450,2006-01-24,4,"This was good and quick to make. I think it should have cooked a bit longer than 15 minutes, so next time I will try it longer or at a higher temperature.  The apples, banana's & cinnamon did compliment each other well.  I had this with Crockpot Oniony Pork Chops with Creamy Mustard Sauce Recipe #16902, rice and salad.  We will be having this again.
"
282840,152450,2006-07-26,2,This recipe had lots of promise but I was disappointed.  The overall flavor was very bland.  It wasn't awful but it didn't go over very well.  I won't make this again.
795458,143954,2008-07-09,0,excellent texture and taste. I followed the recipe exactly except I was low on sour cream and used half low fat yogurt - didn't seem to make a difference and it saves some calories.
135470,446975,2011-10-09,4,"These are simple and tasty, though with the time they take to bake. They aren't overly sweet but for my taste I would use less sugar. I would only use this method again if I had something else going in the oven too, as I get similar results from the microwave or on the stove top in much less time. I used them for a topping for french toast. Made for PAC Fall 2011."
1191355,512728,2014-02-09,4,"Because of the health benefits, I am trying to learn to like avocados.  This isn&#039;t a bad mayo substitute.  I could taste the freshness of the lime.  Will make it again."
115758,97612,2006-03-11,5,Yum...a delightful breakfast/brunch dish thats easy to prepare. Instead of grating the parmesan I chopped mine into small cubes and added to the egg mixture...so every now and then you got a little oozy cheese bite. Thanks for sharing!
24386,97612,2004-09-16,5,"Evelyn, this is a superb dish!  Loved every bite.  I squeezed some of the juice out of the tomatoes before chopping to cut down on the liquid in the dish and added the mandatory clove of minced garlic (use it in almost everything I cook). Also added some black pepper. I bet this would also be great using some cooked and crumbled Italian sausage in it.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
165794,97612,2004-10-08,5,Wonderful and a very simple dish to make.  I made this last night and my husband loved it!  We did not have any cheese or bacon in the house.  I used sausages instead and it was just as good. Thank you!  Looking forward to trying some more of your recommendations.  
143933,292147,2008-04-18,0,This is now my best bread.  I did divide the the amount into 2 loaves get a smaller slice.  I calculated about 50 calories for about 40 small slices.  I like the smaller loaf size.
1176241,292147,2009-04-01,5,"perfect!  i *had* a standard everyday 100% ww recipe i used, but this is my new standard!  thanks so much."
1535,292147,2010-02-25,5,"Wow! I'm impressed! This was as soft and light as store bought wheat bread and lot more flavorful. Even my son, who usually doesn't care for 100% whole wheat bread, asked for seconds. I served it with Recipe #276895. This bread will be made again, often! Thanks for sharing it."
185684,292147,2010-03-31,5,"Very nice bread, soft, chewy, fluffy, fantastic. I did not have gluten so I left it out and still made very good bread, thank you."
1665656,292147,2010-08-15,0,"Amazing!  For the first time, a loaf of 100% whole wheat bread that doesn't come out like a brick!  Quite the opposite actually!  My wife is having a piece and going crazy about it right now.  More recipes like this please!"
314211,292147,2011-02-01,5,At last!  I feel like singing!  I too have been looking for a simple dependable 100%ww at is usable for sandwiches and toast!  I made exactly as printed except there the smallest loaf size on my machine is 2.0 - it still worked well an is my new standard!
350812,292147,2011-05-14,5,I was looking for a low sugar whole wheat bread and this was GREAT!  This is an excellent sandwich bread as it has a very mild taste...it will go great with PB&J or deli meats.  I used skim milk with 1t vinegar and  made the dough in my bread machine and then baked in 2 stoneware loaf pans @ 375 for about 25-30 minutes until the tops were a deep tan color.
237606,97612,2009-07-16,5,"I was looking for a frittata recipe to fix on the stove which wouldn't need folded nor inverted when I came across yours. I made many changes, but used your overall method. Even though I had never fixed a frittata, I found it easy to fix! I converted it into a ham cheese frittata, and it was delicious and beautiful! The idea of broiling it at the end was absolutely brilliant!!! I was looking for a way to fix a frittata for 20-25 people, and your method is the way to go! Thanks a lot for giving me the solution to my challenge! I fixed it in an old lodge in Canada where they have very antiquated, unreliable ovens. Instead of using them, I used the stove, and fixed the frittata in a big roasting pan. Everybody was absolutely amazed seeing me fix such a huge frittata, and they all loved the taste of it. Thank you so much!  Saulo

1588400,97612,2010-04-08,5,"Delish! I added fat free feta, mushrooms, tomatoes, and spinach. Super easy to make. This is a definite keeper!"
153944,100230,2004-12-06,5,"Easy, fluffy, and delicious.  I had lost my recipe over the years and was thrilled for the post. Thank you, mermaidmagic!"
125325,100230,2005-03-03,5,Great frosting! I used about 3/4 cups of sugar since I didn't want it too sweet. Thanks for a great recipe.
24386,100230,2005-03-15,5,"Made some chocolate cupcakes for my grandson who was over yesterday and frosted them with this icing.  We both loved it!  It was a favorite of mine years ago and I was glad to see the recipe posted here.  Thanks, Mermaid."
173579,100230,2005-03-24,5,"This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made this for years.
It is so creamy.  Glad to see it was posted. "
60199,100230,2005-10-29,5,"MMM!  Yummy!  This is very easy to make.  It's smooth, creamy, and not too sweet.  I'll definitely be using this a lot."
115525,100230,2005-12-11,5,"I had never used a cooked base for a frosting, and was a bit unsure.  But I had to try this because of the other rave reviews.  I'm so glad I did!  This frosting is soft and fluffy and melts in your mouth.  Delicious!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for posting."
79229,100230,2007-03-13,5,I've made this twice now. Delicious and easy
293110,100230,2008-12-11,5,"Easy recipe to follow, used these to frost Christmas cookies and it worked wonderfully!  We had enough frosting to make 4 different colors and have left overs!"
739419,100230,2008-12-18,5,"I must be a complete idiot because when I made these all the flour rose to the top in little balls. And I can guarantee it wasn't the recipes fault, I've been doing that a lot lately. lol

I made this as a frosting for brownies (I don't know why I'm pregnant and REALLY craving it) and like I said I messed it up but I was able to take all the chunky flour stuff off of it, and convince my husband it was a buttercream syrup.....

......Ok so I lied, but he believed me and they still tasted great! :-D Next time I will make these correctly, I promise."
1076811,100230,2010-02-22,5,I love this frosting. My MIL uses this frosting always and has been my husbands favorite since he was a kid. I think she got the recipe from a Yankee magazine. It is a FABULOUS on chocolate cake. I have gotten many compliments on it.
286566,470629,2013-07-07,5,"Very clear instructions made this so quick and easy to make.  I have a 900 watt microwave and cooked my bacon for 3 minutes (I usually do my bacon in the oven which would take about 15 minutes but you do get a crispier result and that dark colour which you don&#039;t get from the microwave).  I only cooked 1 egg which was plenty for me and 2 rashers of middle cut bacon and 2 pieces of wholemeal/wholegrain toast for a very filling meal.  Thank you OH, let me try that!, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
2933459,381963,2013-08-06,4,Love this on saut
2310,118433,2005-12-15,5,"5* for health, taste and appeal. My juicer didn't like taking the apples but it sure did help to intersperse them with the carrots...good tip Rita. I added a small 1/2 inch piece of ginger while I was making the juice and it added a nice zing.  DH and I have decided to keep our juicer out and use it more often thanks to you Rita."
208389,118433,2008-08-01,5,"This juice has always been my favourite.  Carrots and apples.  So simple, yet the flavours of the two just seem to go so well together.  If the carrots aren't very big I put in more than four, I like the carrots to be slightly more predominant in the flavours.  Like Geema stated, I also sometimes add a small piece of ginger.  Thanks for posting Rita, now I'll have this in my cookbook so I don't forget about my favourite juice combo!  :)"
37449,118433,2008-10-13,5,So good and good for ya!  I love the flavor of botht the apple and the carrots. Thanks Rita! Made for Vegetarian Swap.
599450,318492,2008-08-19,5,"This is a stealth soup, meaning, it is so simple and with readily available ingredients (pantry items, really), you can whip this up in no time for any impromptu occasion! Although I had Parmesan cheese at the ready, I also had Asiago and used that instead, it just called to me! I cannot wait to try this with Parmesan! The only thing left is for me to get another can of asparagus as a staple for my pantry! Thanks, Bmcnichol! Made for PRMR."
239758,318492,2008-12-17,5,"I'm gobsmacked -- this is so delicious and so easy to make. It really does take only 10 minutes. Made a double batch for lunch for 4 people, and there was huge disappointment that I hadn't made a triple batch. Thanks for a real winner."
204024,318492,2010-12-03,5,This was super quick and easy.  Something you can always have the ingredients for on hand.  Made for PRMR.
227652,318492,2010-12-07,5,"This was an amazing recipe. I was able to find canned asparagus WITHOUT salt added--very glad for that since the regular stuff is loaded w/ sodium! I used fat free half & half for the cream & added about 1/16 tsp garlic powder. Hubby & I both loved it, which was an added bonus since I've been trying to find vegetarian dishes BOTH of us enjoy. Thanks so much for sharing!"
383346,445629,2011-01-08,5,I made half the recipe cause we're only 2.  And I baked it in a pie plate.  But a smaller plate would have been better.  I used only orange cheddar cheeese cause I couldn't find pepper jack cheese.  But I added 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes.  I used light mayonnaise and light cream cheese.  This dip has a great taste.  We tried with crackers but it would be better with pita chips.  Thanks foodtvfan :)  Made for PRMR tag game
34214,22223,2004-01-15,5,"Like it? I LOVE IT!!!!!!I lost mine years ago, never replaced it. But I got a craving and found yours. Boy am I glad I lost mine.! This is absolutley Delicious! Now I have to buy more cans of apple filling."
397676,106707,2008-03-17,4,Very good recipe; it didn't produce as much sauce for basting when I made it but that didn't impact the taste at all!
146742,471840,2013-01-01,5,"Thanks for this simple dumpling recipe.  My family loves them.  I've made your recipe several times, and it is ""family approved""."
1803307859,471840,2014-11-06,0,"I live in Germany currently, and think this is a great recipe. I have made it with rye bread and other crusty bread (we have a larger variety here in Germany because everyone goes daily to the bakery), and it has turned out great each time. I even have made it by boiling it in broth and then instead of serving it with gravy I pour the broth back on it. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!"
2001472448,471840,2017-04-04,0,"My family has made Knodel's since before I was born. Our great grand parents were from Austria. What was different was that this always appeared to me to be a &quot;leftover&quot; meal as they and my mom and now me usually made it with whatever they needed to use up. Such as old bread, different vegies, chicken bones and fat etc. We have always boiled them in the vegie/chicken broth (take the bones out) has been a family staple my whole life. As a matter of fact my daughter called yesterday and asked me to make them for her and family next week..... yes they will be in the chicken broth soup. dan"
271119,378981,2009-09-11,5,"WOW!  A Fried Okra recipe where the batter stays on!  I could hardly believe it.  It was so good and crispy.  I used peanut oil and also added Old Bay.  This is the greatest recipe ever.  Can't wait to try it on squash and green tomatoes.
Thank you so much!"
1298505,378981,2009-07-21,5,"I used a bag of frozen okra, rinsed it with hot water to thaw it quickly.  The portions of the recipe were perfect!  This made 2 cups (two batches) and was excellent.  Having the cornmeal batter FINALLY stay on the okra was so nice.  Thanks for sharing this recipe."
133174,378981,2009-09-03,5,I used fresh garden okra and in place of the salt and pepper used a teaspoon of Cajun Seasoning.  The finished dish reminded me very much of the okra from my childhood.
440818,378981,2013-06-15,3,"3 stars for the fact that the batter did indeed stay on.  Not my favorite though.  I&#039;m not exactly sure why.  It definitely wasn&#039;t too heavy, very crispy, maybe too crispy.  I ended up breaking the coating off each piece before eating it.  Guess I&#039;ll stick with the batter instead."
1866974,378981,2013-08-25,5,"I made this with frozen, chopped and unbreaded okra (it&#039;s all I can get around here), and it was wonderful!  Just let the okra thaw enough to get a little sticky (30 minutes to an hour), then proceed as usual.  I never would have dreamed frozen, unbreaded okra could be so unbelievably good, but it is!!"
2000459478,378981,2015-09-07,0,"The batch in the picture is undercooked in my humble southern fried opinion,  but the recipe is perfect!  Y&#039;all can keep your batter recipes. This is the way you do it."
2001139691,378981,2016-08-23,5,A friend if ours gave us a bag of some beautiful homegrown okra. I have never made it before even though I love fried okra and buy the frozen. I have to tell you that this is the best and simplest recipe ever. Coating stayed on and the okra cooked perfectly.
2000149383,378981,2016-09-16,5,"I suck at cooking and have never fried okra, but this turned out great! Had to add a little salt and pepper, but we ate every one! Had a lot of breading and tasted great. Thanks for the recipe not needing buttermilk!"
2001219586,378981,2016-10-25,5,"This is the best and easiest fried okra recipe I have ever followed. I went to the farmers market Sunday and bought fresh okra. Found this recipe Monday and love it! No buttermilk - thank you for that! The batter stays on and my okra does not have that heavy, greasy feel to it. I'm using this recipe for fish, fried green tomatoes, and fried mushrooms!"
2001526834,378981,2017-07-01,3,Did youknow that if you dust the okra first with corn starch the breading really holds on
522562,378981,2017-07-02,0,I always have to add a jalape&ntilde;o or two when I fry okra. Love the heat and the flavor.
2001635579,378981,2017-07-20,5,The perfect recipe for fried okra. I followed the directions and ingredients to the tee! My daughter said it tasted better than Cracker Barrel's fried okra. I think that's a pretty good compliment.
267574,146373,2005-11-27,5,"I saw this recipe at noon, and made it for dinner at 6. I baked them on a non-stick foil lined cookie sheet, and these were the most incredible potatoes I ever had. 10 STARS!"
53959,146373,2005-12-22,5,These were really good. I was a bit leery about the Cayenne pepper as I know my daughters do not care for really spicy foods. But it actually was not that spicy. It have just the perfect amount of kick to it. I followed the directions exactly except used the minimun amount stated Cayenne. We will be making this again in the future. Thank you!
219642,146373,2006-01-04,5,"Really good!Made this as a side for meatloaf and my family ate them all up!I omitted the cayenne because my 3 and 5 yr old were eating with us and they were still delicious.Will definitely try them with the cayenne next time for the extra ""kick"".Thanks for the recipe!"
224740,146373,2006-01-10,5,"Very good potatoes, I like the hint of sweetness the sugar brings to the mix. It could even be made a little spicier - like this it's very flavourful though. Served with KITTENCAL's Chicken in Honey-Lemon Sauce  recipe #150689 - yum!"
53932,146373,2006-01-14,5,Yup--they're good! Served mine with pulled pork and cole slaw.  Loved the combination of spices.
209603,146373,2006-01-24,4,these were tasty little potatoes. i omitted the oil and sprayed them with olive oil pam instead and the water on the potatoes kept the seasonings on. i cut them into smaller peices than the instructions said but they still took over an hour to cook. sadly my husband doesnt like potatoes baked this way so i dont get to eat them much but i love them and the seasoning in this recipe is fabulous. they are even good the next day warmed up in the toaster.
49542,146373,2006-04-14,5,Tasty and easy - a terrific side dish!  Loved the combination of spices.  Looking forward to making again!
265102,146373,2006-10-17,4,We were looking for a different way to bake potatoes.  Used 1/4 c EVOO to cut down on fat. They came out very tasty!
47510,146373,2006-12-31,5,Delicious potatoes and so easy to prepare.  I served these to accompany Pat's Gourmet Salmon Cakes #185076.  The spicy flavors of these potatoes really complimented the mild flavors in the salmon cakes.
404505,146373,2007-01-25,5,"Ooohwee, those are spicy! Now mind you, it doesn't take musch for us eastern Canadians to find something spicy. While I didn't use the full amount of spice, I did cut my potatoes smaller which probably didn't leave enough plain potato to counter the spiciness. Next time I'll make them bigger, I just ddn't have enough time to cook bigger potatoes. I also did not use the garlic and onion powders however I quartered a clove and a whole onion to add to it. I will definitely be making these again, they were a hit around the table! I'm sure most of you won't find these too spicy at all. Thanks for a VERY tasty recipe!"
209441,146373,2007-04-02,5,"thanks for yet another wonderful recipe Kit, I left out the cayenne pepper, but used more seasoning salt, really good potato recipe, thank you my friend."
366118,146373,2007-06-02,4,"These were tasty. I used very little cayenne, based on some of the other reviews, but next time I think I'll use the full amount. I will try these again."
371738,146373,2007-08-23,4,Perfect amount of kick to them.
386585,146373,2008-01-23,4,They were quite a hit!  Will definitely make these again.
537937,146373,2008-01-27,5,"Wowzer, this definitely packs a punch.  I used the powdered cayenne pepper and followed the rest of your recipe exact.  Great taste Kitten to the standard potato wedges.  The men in my family loved it!!"
590105,340071,2008-12-03,5,"This was really good!  I might not have used the full amount of cinnamon, as I just sprinkled it in without measuring and I thought 1 tsp sounded like a lot.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thank you for posting it.  Easy and yummy!  Reviewed for the Veg*n Recipe Swap."
37449,340071,2008-12-07,5,"Yummy! I eyeballed the cinnamon, probably used a little less. I love almond milk, and this just made it better!"
80998,340071,2008-12-08,5,What a great breakfast this morning.  I feel healthier after drinking it.  lol.  I will make this againl  Thanks mersades.  Made for veggie swap 2008.
424680,340071,2008-12-12,5,"I tripled this recipe in order to have two tall drinks for 2 of us & that was about right, although I did use just 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon! A GREAT TASTING BREAKFAST DRINK! Thanks for posting, & I'll have to dig into that recipe for homemade almond milk! [Tagged, made & reviewed as a PRESSIE in the Aus/NZ 12 Days of Christmas Recipe Swap]"
452940,340071,2009-04-14,4,"For the almond milk, I simply added 1/2 tsp almond extract to 2% milk. I loved this shake, but didn't care for the cinnamon in it. But I must say that the combination of almond and banana flavors were exceptional! Thanks for sharing. :)"
542159,340071,2009-09-03,5,"Very satisfying shake. Made two one using vanilla almond milk and one using chocolate almond, both were great. Love how healthy and satisfying these were. Thanks so much for the great post."
804550,340071,2009-10-06,4,"I actually loved this healthy beverage although my DD & DH felt it needed something more to sweeten it. I felt the banana made it sweet enough as it was very ripe.
Thanks for posting! Made for ""Veg*n Swap 15 ~ Oct 2009!"
538563,146373,2008-03-15,5,"This is one of the best recipes I've found so far on Zaar!  Potatoes are my favorite ""food group,"" and these are perfect just as the recipe's written.  I did cut each large potato into eights instead of fourths.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
767712,146373,2008-05-27,5,My husband and I had our first BBQ last night and these were a HUGE hit!  From now on...this is how I'm making potatoes on BBQ night!  SOOOOOOO YUMMYYYYYYY
497077,146373,2008-06-03,5,"These potatoes are wonderful! I halved the recipe and included the salt, cayenne, and black pepper-we like them spicy. Will try them on the grill next time. Thank you for a great recipe!!! Update: adjusted recipe to include 3 sweet potatoes (last minute guests), cooked all on the grill in foil pan and they were fantastic!!!"
778484,146373,2008-08-24,5,"These potatoes were excellent, we grilled them over charcoal in tin foil and the flavors were outstanding.  We added fresh onions instead of the onion powder and used olive oil instead of oil.  And we are having them again tonight, we are thinking of adding bell pepper and crumbled bacon.  Let you know how it turns out.  Thank you for another outstanding recipe."
326787,146373,2009-05-18,5,"Yummmm, Yummm Yum, outstanding potatoes. I've made several of Kittencal's potatoe recipes and all have been wonderful! I will be making these again. 5 stars for sure."
133174,146373,2009-08-30,5,I made these to go with pork chops.  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings.  Other than that they were made as directed in the oven.
440324,146373,2009-09-07,5,Excellent side dish. My BF and I enjoyed it very much. Thank you for sharing.
529278,146373,2010-05-11,5,"Another Kittencal pleaser!  We halved the recipe, since the kids won't eat potatoes that aren't mashed anyway, and could have fed 3 adults with what we made.  Tender, flavorful, simple.  My husband grilled them in a cast iron dutch oven.  Will do again!!"
937635,146373,2010-07-24,5,Great flavor! we halved the recipe and my DH cooked on the grill. Took a bit longer than we thought it would but it was wonderful. Thanks for the keeper!
1362273,146373,2010-09-17,5,"Kittencal, you are a household name at our house near Washington DC. ;) I often precede my meal presentation with ""And this is another meal from who, folks?"" And ""Kittencal!"" is piped through the house. This recipe is yet another that lives up to the bearer's name. The potatoes are amazingly flavorful, and are deceivingly easy to make.<br/><br/>You are a Queen among cooks. :)"
724516,146373,2011-07-14,5,"My DH just loved these potatoes, the spicyer the better. I have been asked to make them again soon, it was just the right blend of spices. very very nice and tasty. Thank you for posting. Made for the diabetic forum July 2011."
211577,146373,2013-11-26,5,"These were fantastic! Left out the cayenne (for my toddler) but otherwise followed the recipe (halved). I think I need to try this mix of spice on popcorn, I seriously liked it that much!"
457321,313297,2008-10-25,5,"This was an incredibly moist and delicious banana bread.  Took a little longer in the oven.  The first time I made it, used ground flax seed and water in place of the eggs.  Second time, actual eggs--both work equally well."
1356721,340071,2010-09-04,5,This was very refreshing & satisfying!!  I doubled the recipe and drank it down for a quick lunch :D  I used fresh almond milk and doubled the bananas as we have the small lady fingers out here.  This was super delicious & I will be making again for sure!!  Made for Veg*n Swap 26!!
593927,340071,2010-12-24,5,Yummy filling! I used homemade almond milk. I would make this again.
376986,340071,2011-03-03,4,"I was suprised to enjoy the light cinnamon taste.  At first I didn't like it much, but as i continued to drink it it grew on me."
465056,253946,2007-10-12,4,"Nice easy dish - next time I would omit the salt, with the canned broth it was a bit too salty."
88378,253946,2011-01-11,5,"We loved this pork dish!!  Excellent flavor - just perfect.  I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the chops along with the salt, pepper and rosemary.  This went together with ease and produced an entree of which not one speck remains.  I served it with macaroni and cheese, peas, and toasted challah bread slathered in butter.  Great meal for an icy night!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe; I'll most assuredly make it again."
17608,13379,2001-11-23,0,I have an alternate version of this that I whipped up last night.  I used a package of frozen rhubarb in place of the apples and a package of strawberries in place of the raspberries.  I also eliminated the lemon juice.  I guess this would be Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble.
9869,13379,2002-01-24,5,"I used granny smith apples and the frozen berries I used were a mix of raspberries, boysenberries and blueberries. Not only did we have the cream but also some plain vanilla ice cream, yum!! We all loved this very tasty dessert, thanks for posting."
20160,13379,2002-02-15,5,"This was really good.  I used apples, raspberries and blackberries.  We had it with ice cream.  Yummy!  I would leave out the nutmeg next time - just me, I'm not that crazy over nutmeg."
39035,13379,2003-04-17,5,I will be making this over and over again. Yummy
123126,13379,2004-03-05,5,EXCELLENT!!  I have made this 4 times in the past 3 weeks..Delicious..I double the topping because I love it so much...Thanks for this recipe...
71463,13379,2006-05-15,4,First time this was made it was to tart. Crumble did not work well with 1/4 cup butter. Second try I used 1/2 cup butter to get the correct crumble consistency. Using 2 red delicious apples added some natural sweetness and 3/4 cup of berries(for a little less fruit)and more crumble.  Our family prefers less fruit with a little more crumble.  This is a very simple and tasty dessert which is a keeper.
353579,13379,2008-07-17,5,Lovely!  I thought the tart/sweet level was just right.  I used granny smith apples and sprinkled just a touch of sugar over them before putting on the crumble topping.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and allspice to the mix.  A simple and delicious fruity dessert.  Thanks for posting!
806937,13379,2009-10-30,4,"I used granny smith and macintosh apples and cinnamon. I did add a bit more than 1/4 cup butter. I also had to bake for at least 40 minutes. Good flavor, and not too greasy. (I also used part brown sugar for the total amount) Sprinkling in a bit of toasted walnuts to the flour mix, made a nice taste too."
168462,13379,2009-10-31,5,"This was a great crumble. When I pulled my fresh raspberries out of the fridge they were not usable, so I used a mix of strawberries, blueberries and the apples of course. I used about 1/3 cup sugar, cinnamon in place of the nutmeg and about 1/4 cup of butter. It was wonderful. Next time I will try with the raspberries it calls for. Thanks for the recipe."
521337,13379,2010-03-29,5,Really yummi! But I made a few changes - most importantly adding oats and omitting lemon juice. Thanks!
1534828,13379,2010-04-11,4,"I found it quite tart. However, this was balanced out nicely when served with vanilla ice cream. I also added some cinnamon and only used a dash of nutmeg. I think next time I will decrease or altogether omit the lemon juice. Also, 25 minutes wasn't nearly enough time as the apples were still quite crunchy. It took a good 40 minutes to bake. Overall, I love the flavour the raspberries add and I will be making this recipe again with a few alterations!"
1965026,13379,2014-04-19,5,I love apple crumble and was looking for a new recipe to try and I came across this one. It never occurred to me to add raspberries but oh my does it ever taste amazing! I like the topping as it is similar to the one I grew up with and I love the simplicity. Ive already made it twice this week!
386585,23718,2009-10-14,5,"Well, this couldn't be simpler, yet adds a nice depth of flavor to your meal.  I used it over steamed asparagus, but I could see how it would enhance any vegetable, and would also be nice over fish.  I will be experimenting with this again.  It takes the ho-hum to a tastier level.  Made for Newest Zaar tag game."
452940,258967,2008-02-12,5,"I halved this recipe and made it in a mini-loaf pan. It was really weird watching sugar melt, that alone is worth a star :)
The 24 hour no-peek about killed me. 
I finally got to drain it, although there was not much juice. Since it was already wrapped on 5 sides by the foil pan, I kept it in it, and wrapped heavy duty foil around it.
After baking it for 4 hours (since it was a half recipe), I took it out and unwrapped it. (Confusing because it was the only way to know if apples were browned) which they were not. 
I sprinkled the top with a bit more sugar and returned it to the oven 'as is' for an additional 15 minutes to brown.
Now moving on to flavor... Let's just say this is comparing apples and orange rinds (LOL). 
What a wonderful blending of flavors! Simple ingredients, yet BIG on flavor! I served it over vanilla ice cream and my mouth went WOW!"
212609,380745,2009-08-17,4,"This was very easy to put together.I omitted the sour cream,as my mixture seemed a little loose,after adding the soup and the milk,but it didn't seem to matter (although I'm sure it will be lovely with it!!).
I think that this would be great with other soup flavours too-maybe chicken or mushroom!"
166642,380745,2010-01-08,5,These are very tasty. I added all of the ingredients and baked them for 30 minutes. I did use the optional bacon and I think they make them extra delicious! Thanks for sharing. Made for Photo Tag.
711409,315983,2008-07-26,0,I haven't tried it yet but i have an apricot tree and have made jam and dried them but we still have a ton left over and don't know what to do with them; so i will have to try this to see how we like it.
383346,460069,2011-08-31,5,I used unsweetened juices so it was not too sweet.  This was perfect for me.  I used half and half cream.  The taste is really good.  Thanks Sharon :)  Made for Newest Zaar Tag
424680,460069,2011-09-02,5,"My other half wasn't too enthused when I read the recipe, so I only made this for myself & used the cream of coconut! However, once he tasted it, I was encouraged to make another one, so I made another couple & we thoroughly enjoyed them! Definitely will be making these again! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
321820,258647,2007-10-12,5,This was outstanding! HOWEVER I did bake my covered for almost an hour then uncovered for about 20 minutes and they were perfect but my new oven is slow. I followed the recipe exactly and it received RAVES! Thank you Pricilla for a really fabulous recipe that I will make time and time again.
76951,258647,2007-10-14,4,"This was very good.  I precooked the potatoes in the microwave so it wouldn't take so long.  I think next time, I'll sprinkle them with cheddar cheese instead of the sour cream and serve the sour cream on the side.  Great recipe, Pricilla!"
229619,258647,2007-10-18,5,"These are OMG good.  I had medium size potatoes so I cut them in quarters and it still took quite a bit longer than the posted time to cook so I'll probably precook next time.  They were worth the wait though.  I took leftovers to work today and everybody that walked through the break room while I was eating asked ""what's that?"" and ""did you make it?""  We'll be having these again!"
305531,258647,2009-04-11,5,"Yummers! After reading the reviews, I microwaved my potatoes for about 10 minutes before preparing the rest of the dish. These are very simple and good. Thanks Pricilla for a great side dish. Made for PAC Spring 2009."
227978,258647,2009-10-02,5,"This was really delicious.  I loved it, and so did everyone else in my family.  The sour cream and green onions really contributed a lot of flavor to this dish.  Thanks Pricilla.  Made for Fall '09 Pick-A-Chef."
354675,258647,2009-10-27,5,"These were a great deconstructed baked potato.  We skimped a little on the butter and sour cream, but then topped it with cheddar cheese at the end, go figure!  Surely a splurge and PERFECT alongside steaks, tx so much!"
302094,136093,2007-06-07,4,"I made this the other day, I haven't tried it yet, but it looks really good. I did use only 1 cup of nuts, I think 1-1/2 cups would be too much. I did get 3 pints exactly. I can't wait to try it. Thanks!"
99136,136093,2009-08-24,5,"This makes really good jam.
I used pecans instead of walnuts.
It was really thick and I was afraid it would scorch before I could add the sugar, so I added a little water to the bananas.
We have eaten it on toast and also ice cream.
I am planning to make more to give as gifts at Christmas."
681868,136093,2010-04-13,4,"I had to make this a couple of times to get it to taste like I believe it should. When I made this the 1st time, I used pecans in place of the walnuts and followed the 3 cups pureed banana but didn't realize until the 2nd attempt that I use box powdered pectin. When I saw on here that it says ""1 (3 ounce) box pectin"" And thought ""Oh Dear Lord!!"" it's only 1.75 ounce.  I had to investigate and realize that it wasn't really my fault because the recipe doesn't state liquid pectin or powdered pectin. The recipe must be assumed it's liquid pectin because Liquid pectin comes in 6 ounces with 2 pouches in it. I only used the 1 box of powdered pectin. But the 1st time made, It did made 3 pints, but it was very sweet and way to rich in pecan taste that it tasted like pecan pie verses Banana Nut Bread. As what everyone was saying. They could barely taste the bananas....having said that, the 3 cups for me was only 4 bananas. I guess I had huge suckers. So I attempted a 2nd batch, this time with the 10 bananas, pureed. And replacing the walnuts again with pecans...I tasted banana, but I had to triple the cinnamon and nutmeg...Followed the rest of the directions and man oh man...it tasted like banana bread that I make. SO having said this. The recipe is really good. I would toss out the cup measurement of the banana puree and go for the 10 bananas, because that hits the spot."
583577,136093,2011-01-02,5,"I made two batches of this to give away as christmas gifts. It set up beautifully and really does taste like banana bread batter! The pectin measurement specified is very misleading - the boxes of powdered pectin are only 1.75 ounces per box while liquid pectin comes in 3 ounce packets (usually sold in a box containing 2 3 ounce packets.) When I first read through the recipe and saw box of pectin I assumed powdered but on second read through I noticed the 3 ounces and used 1 pouch of liquid pectin. I got three pints out of this recipe plus a little container of extra that I stuck in the fridge. I made a bunch of different flavors of jam for christmas gifts and with all of the ""extras"" I had in the fridge I made thumbprint cookies that I took to work so people could sample the flavors and pick what kind of jam they wanted. Everyone raved about this banana jam and it was the first flavor to go!!"
1958210,136093,2011-07-17,5,"I just made this and added a splash of vanilla extract.  I also used 1 box of the powdered pectin rather than the liquid.  I just started making jelly/jam this summer.  It isn't pretty to look at.  However, my house smells great and it tastes AMAZING!"
175727,136093,2012-06-30,4,"Very very good, very very easy.. intense in flavor!!!!  Great Xmas gifts,thanks!<br/><br/>Re made again the other day.  I added in about 4 Tbsp banana liquor, even better!"
1281975,136093,2014-09-19,5,I made a banana cake and used this for in between the layers it is yummy!
2001714826,136093,2017-09-15,5,Has anyone tried using Splenda instead of sugar? I'm going to try it this weekend. Hopefully it still comes out the same!
165623,351259,2009-01-26,5,This was a good smoothie - I didn't need any sugar as the berries I had were frozen with just a bit of sugar on them. I preferred half a banana and DH preferred the whole banana. Thanks for a light snack
37449,351259,2009-01-31,5,Great smoothie! I like my smoothies best without yogurt or dairy in them and this was so good! Thanks for posting Bev!
1097671,351259,2009-06-12,4,Good base recipe you can customize to your taste.  I added strawberries as well and a little bit extra sugar since the blackberries I had were particularly tart.  I prefer a slightly thicker consistency but this was ok.
12258,10047,2001-07-10,0,Thanks Danielle!  I will give this a try.  It sounds delicous!! Have a TERRIFIC Week!
205783,226259,2007-06-02,4,"I made this today for lunch, and it was fantastic comfort food on a winter's day.  (It's been sunny mind you).  There's something so lovely about smoky bacon, cheese, potato & onions all together, baking happily in the oven.  Unfortunately there were no leftovers, but I bet they'd be great heated up.  Thanks English Rose."
114936,88999,2004-04-16,5,"This was such an easy dish to make. Yet it tasted like I slaved over it all day. I'm not one for the sticky,hard crisp so I made it in a 9x13 and it turned out more like a cobbler. Next time, I think I'll double the batch to make it good and thick. Like you said Jewelz ""delish desert"". I served it with ice cream. This dish served 12 people and all 12 really enjoyed it. Thanks for a great recipe."
6258,88999,2004-06-25,5,"A very nice dessert,so easy to make, and so lovely to look at.  I used huge (really, really, really huge) blackberries and some McIntosh apples.  The combination of these fruits and the ""crisp"" topping was delightful.  It was simply divine!  The combinations are unlimited (thinking peaches)!!!  Thanks for sharing this great summer dessert recipe.  It will definately be used again soon :-)"
1396149,142970,2009-09-26,5,"this was awesome! I didn't have the r cheese, but had some moz. cheese and used that with the feta and parmesan. Just cut the recipe for me alone-my husband doesn't eat interesting. but I loved it."
1554808,442142,2012-12-11,5,"My coworker brought this for a pot luck and it was gone in minutes.  It's absolutely fantastic.  When I make it, I use 4oz of softened cream cheese in addition to the mayo, and I grate a shallot instead of the onion.  Gives it a nice, mild flavor.  I've had countless people ask me for the recipe and am so glad that people love it as much as we do!"
1541622,442142,2014-09-10,5,I have been looking for this recipe. It is an old fashioned recipe but it is a keeper.
932192,392122,2012-07-04,5,"This is SO good! The banana taste is really great! I like that you don't mash or cook down the bananas, just blend 'em in while frozen, I think this is why the banana taste is go fresh. This was so smooth and creamy, and very rich! We enjoyed it thoroughly. Thanks for posting!"
2517448,285716,2012-11-21,0,"really easy,really good."
37449,112725,2006-06-27,5,One of the easiest recipes here on Zaar! Yummy too! Thanks Rita!

527886,423880,2010-05-28,0,"It's definitely fast! I prefer the texture from using an actual mango, but this is a nice drink when convenience is more important."
552613,423880,2010-06-03,4,It doesn't get much easier than this recipe! If you don't have the actual mango fruit around this is an easy fix to satisfy your sweet tooth while still being a healthy drink.  I used nearly fat free natural yoghurt and it worked just fine.  Made for vegetarian swap.
286566,423738,2011-07-01,5,"The DM and I each really enjoyed this wonderfully filling and tasty sandwich for lunch.  I used an organic, 98% fat free, low GI Rye bread, smoky bacon (cooked in the oven), a lovely creamy camembert and a juice vine ripened tomatoe, thank you Dreamer in Ontario, made for Newest ZAAR Stars."
222055,238494,2007-07-04,5,"I made one sandwich using a whole small avocado.I didn't measure the mayo, and I had a most wonderful tomato to use. I don't think the avocado adds much flavor to the tomato sandwich, but I do love biting into it. If there's an avocado in the house, I will have a hard time not using it on a tomato sandwich! Thanks thepitclub!!!"
515278,238494,2009-07-20,5,"I make this same sandwich, but add a little mustard with the mayo. For variety I often add a slice of cheese and/or crisp slices of bacon."
673444,238494,2009-07-21,4,I made mine with pesto and it was good!
166642,292111,2008-05-15,4,This is a very tasty dressing. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for sharing!
614831,49477,2009-11-21,4,"Made with a quality balsamic, this is quite good and wonderfully easy.  I used a fraction of the olive oil.  Will make again."
95743,49477,2003-10-24,5,"Started with fresh spinach, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Dh just loved the sauteed garlic slivers and I really enjoyed the balsamic vinegar. Even having to steam the spinach first, it took less than 10 minutes to make.  "
133174,49477,2006-08-15,4,I made this with frozen spinach and would love to try it with fresh.  This is a nice quick recipe and the vinegar adds the crowning touch.  Thanks for sharing.
452699,49477,2007-04-14,5,Very simple and tasty. Used 10 ounces of fresh spinach instead of frozen and recipe came out great.
88378,49477,2007-05-01,5,"Oh-so-delicious!  I left out the garlic but added toasted pine nuts.  Simple and flavorful, the perfect complement to our honey garlic pork chops and a pasta pilaf.  Wonderful!  Will make this again!!"
234062,49477,2007-11-26,4,This was really good! I absolutely recommend it! I added pine nuts and had it as a side. I'll definitely do so again. Thanks for sharing!
844554,49477,2008-10-17,5,This was a good recipe. We love balsamic vinegar so it worked for us.
4470,49477,2010-03-13,5,"Very tasty easy recipe.  I used roasted garlic so no need to pan fry it, omitted oil, doubled the garlic. It only took minutes to make the recipe.  Served with roasted  pork tenderloin.  Great dinner"
103876,49477,2010-04-01,5,Very good!  Th balsamic vinegar added a nice sweet touch.  I will be making spinach this way from now on.  Thanks for posting!
789516,49477,2012-05-07,5,Used fresh baby spinach and eye balled all the ingedients.  Wonderful and easy.
2001521872,49477,2017-05-05,5,"so good. maybe it's not what the recipe meant to do, but the garlic turned out sort of crispy... I'd double or triple next time!! the crunch and flavor was so nice with the softness of the spinach!"
489121,192410,2007-06-04,5,"I'm so glad I found this recipe! I love marranitos and now I can make them myself. These do taste like they are from the bakery. I just made them for a family gathering but since everyone was so full they took them to eat in the morning with coffee so I'm waiting to here what they had to say. There are a few things I would definitely suggest that were not mentioned in the recipe. First, roll the dough to 1/2 thickness and use the egg wash! the first batch came out crunchy with a matte look. I also had to reduce the baking time to about 12 mins.
Lastly use parchment paper!! I didn't have any so I used wax paper and had to carefully peel the paper off the cookies. Thanks so much for posting!!"
64642,192410,2007-10-11,5,These were terrific and tasted every bit as delicious as what we can get at the Mexican market.  Highly recommend
559592,192410,2007-12-14,5,My husband is hispanic and he LOVED these...he said they tasted just like the ones from the mexican bakeries back home. Definately worth it.
611301,192410,2010-01-26,5,I love this recipe. I'm so glad I found it. I looked all over the internet and I'm glad I found yours . They came out beautiful and tasted just like the bakery. We didnt have a Pig cookie cutter so we used a huge dino instead but it made no difference. Very easy to make. I highly recommend ! and Ive made them twice for my family.
1535294,192410,2010-01-28,5,"This recipe is great. I grew up eating Marranitos as a child and had a favorite bakery version that included anise seeds. I added 1/2 tsp ground anise seeds, and they were perfect. These were the closest in flavor to the Marranitos I remember. No problem with sticking if you use silicone baking sheets."
1466341,192410,2010-12-17,5,Great recipe - the taste is unmistakeably 'marranito'!  I had a bit of trouble with the texture though.  It was way too dry (I didn't judge well while adding the flour) and I had to add more milk and knead and knead to get it to come together.  So they were even more dense than usual!  But I think some minor tweaking (maybe also some additional baking soda) and this is going to become a family favorite.  My husband had never had them and was thoroughly impressed!
1229355,192410,2011-07-05,4,"These cookies were so easy to make! If you're looking for a fun baking project for kids, this would be perfect :D I'm giving the recipe 4 stars because I took other reviewers' advice and made a few alterations: I added 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp ground anise, I upped the milk to 1/3 C, and I reduced the molasses to about 3/4C. They're delicious, although I think next time I'll add a touch more spice because the molasses flavor was still quite pronounced. I also might try sprinkling coarse sugar on top after doing the egg wash for some crunch and extra sweetness. I will definitely be using this recipe for gingerbread men come Christmastime! Thanks for sharing!"
2251794,192410,2013-03-02,1,These are NOT marranitos but are more like gingersnaps.  The recipe also has too much flour and should be lowered to 4 1/2 to 5 cups.  The cookies are hard not soft like marranitos.
2000720232,192410,2015-11-29,4,"Great recipe! You may have to experiment with the amount of milk, though; add additional milk by the spoonful, if necessary."
2000771707,192410,2015-12-24,2,Do I put the hogwash before I put them in the oven
2001874427,192410,2017-12-21,1,Genius? Hum not so much. Recipe needs a redo. Flour and liquid ratio are way off. Had to read reviews to make corrections. Did not turn out as expected. Added water and more milk.
2001910274,192410,2018-01-03,5,"First of all your recipe is wrong! 2nd attempt had to tweak with more milk and lots more kneading ended up with tons of cookies! I do not own a pig cookie cutter so my sister and I baked gingerbread man, stars and snowman"
41578,206557,2009-06-23,5,"Can't beat this when you need to come up with an appetizer in a hurry!!!!!  Very good and easy and ONLY 2 ingredients.  Hey, the possibilities are unlimited too for adding other ingredients that you happen to have on hand.  Thanks so much for sharing, Hill Family."
43083,206557,2009-11-12,5,YUM! This was too easy and delicious. I believe this is a very hard recipe to photograph though. LOL. My 7 yr old and I scarfed this with a spoon. Definite repeat. I love sour cream on chili but the cream cheese really took it to another level.
333017,206557,2010-08-20,5,"What a fast, easy recipe.  I used Stagg's chili with ground beef and served it with dipper chips.  Next time I make chili, I will set aside some for this recipe!!  I can see myself making this one often as I always have these ingredients on hand.  Thanks for the posting!!"
58104,137618,2005-09-28,5,"No guilt! I ate this chilled as a dessert! Topped with yogurt, I hated to wreck such a healthy dessert topping it with whipped cream! I also skipped the sugar and added a couple raisins to the barley and apples while cooking! Very good! A must make!"
4470,270471,2008-10-08,5,"Wonderful dinner recipe.  I had some leftover veggies that I added to the tomatoes under the eggs.  Baked perfectly in 7 minutes, covered."
1072593,270471,2014-07-29,5,"I practically just discovered the internet last month and look, I&#039;m already at 2437 reviews!!!  Great recipe."
35965,31683,2002-09-12,5,"I didn't use leftovers as I usually don't have any.  I cooked up 1 cup of frozen corn, 1 cup of brussel sprouts and 1 cup of lima beans, then used them for the three cups of vegetables.  I figured leftover veggies would have been cooked...lol.  One bite and my husband said, ""This is definitely 5 stars!""  I had a big dinner in the works (was serving in courses), but he ate two huge plates and was too full to eat much else.  I will definitely be making this a lot.  In the past I've thrown those 1 cup leftovers in the garbage, but now I think I'll dedicate a bowl for accumulating 3 cups of veggies in the freezer for this casserole.  I can see it wouldn't hardly matter what vegetable you used, it would still be good!  Thank you for sharing this recipe Tara.  It is delicious!!!"
30789,31683,2002-09-16,5,"Is this ever good!  The vegetables I used were leftover fresh ones:  corn, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli. I used cheddar and jack cheeses. Everyone in my family loved it and I will certainly be making this casserole often.  Thanks, Tara!"
22724,31683,2002-09-30,5,"What a delicious way to use up left over veggies...or as in my case...I had a bag of mixed veggies that was not quite enough to use for a full meal, and a bag of broccoli florets that wasn't enough for a full meal either.  I just cooked them up, then continued with your recipe as directed.  I was skeptical that I could get them to try it...but they did and it was a huge hit!!  This is definitely going in the veggie rotation list!  Thanks for the GREAT recipe :)"
45001,31683,2002-12-06,5,"Fantastic way to use leftovers.  The milk and eggs make a nice custard.  I use a lot more than just 3 cups veggies, perhaps even 4-5.  This can be a good meatless entree, accompanied with bread and salad."
116478,31683,2004-01-09,5,"Yummy! This recipe was nice and easy (an amateur cook here). Didn't have leftovers so I cooked up carrots, broccoli and potatos. Used Mozzarella & Racclette cheese b/c that's all I had.  It turned out great. Thanks!"
54243,31683,2004-05-21,5,"I enjoyed this casserole. I used carrots, broccoli, and celery.   It was a light, sweet tasting casserole that looked good and tasted even better.  My husband said ""Breakfast tomorrow""...and that is sooo unlike him..Really a nice casserole to use up leftovers."
104283,31683,2004-06-02,5,"My family thought this was a yummy side dish casserole. I used our favorite vegetables: corn, broccoli, and carrots. I used grated colby cheese. This had a good custard-like texture and will make a good side for most anything. Thanks--will be making this often."
89435,31683,2005-02-06,5,"this is one of the easiest , tastiest recipes that i have made. we had a bunch of random things in the fridge... nothing really that fit together to make a meal and then i found this recipe. it turned out alot better than i had hoped. it is similar to a breakfast casserole but so much better!  i used (silk brand) soy milk instead of regular milk. i used a can of mixed vegetables (which had : carrots, potatoes, celery, peas, green beans, corn, and lima beans.) i also had some chopped brocoli that i added. i really liked the variety that the mixed vegetables added as well as it being easy ( just opening the can and pouring it in). i think it would be really good to add some tomato next time. will definately use this recipe again.
thanks tara!"
36944,31683,2006-01-18,5,"This recipe was so fast to put together and will make a very simple and delicious side dish or entree.  It gets an extra star from me for being able to use leftovers or whatever you have on hand.  I used corn, green peas,tomatoes and whole wheat bread.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Tara."
185708,31683,2006-01-21,4,"This was great for using up those bits and pieces in the fridge. I used a mix of leftover and frozen veggies (corn, peppers, spinach, peas) and diced ham to equal 3 cups. I buttered the casserole dish, but otherwise skipped the butter and didn't miss it at all. Also, I added a dash of hot sauce and 1 t. dijon mustard to milk mixture. Took almost an hour to bake, so I may try it at 350 next time. "
210117,31683,2006-02-04,5,"I love this recipe! As mentioned before it is a great way to use leftover veggies.  I doubled the recipe to use as a side dish for a large family dinner, then the next morning I heated the leftovers for breakfast for my husband and I. Thanks!"
147109,31683,2006-08-18,3,"This recipe is very easy, but just not to our taste I guess.  I thought the custard like texture was just not something we would probably like again. I might try it one more time with different veggies (I used corn, peas and green beans) or different bread (I used homemade bread). Thanks!"
141012,31683,2006-10-16,5,"This is easiest vegetable casserole ever, except for a bit of chopping that takes time. It always turns out perfect and looks fabulous. I have doubled and tripled the recipe on various occasions. It has never failed me, except once when I used zuchinni and it gave off a lot of liquid. There was a puddle at the bottom on the dish. I now saute vegetables like mushrooms and zuchinni that give off a lot of liquid if I have to use them. It is amazing the day it is made, but tends to lose some of its texture the next day. Highly recommend for a dinner party, Thanks for sharing"
458087,31683,2007-04-26,5,Tried it with mushrooms peas corn and peppers! Turned out really good!!
403089,31683,2007-08-13,4,"This recipes is really great!  I used some frozen veggies (corn, peas and spinach) wheat bread and mozz and it was mighty tasty.  I used it a side-dish along with some Aidells sausage, it was a fantastic meal and so simple only taking minutes to assemble.  I will definitely be making this again, it's a quick, tasty, versatile (ie; you can really make it with whatever you want!) meal. Thanks Tara!"
144897,31683,2007-10-09,4,This was easy to put together and tasty also.  I'll have to remember to try it with a different veggie combo sometime too :)
288351,31683,2008-02-06,5,"I made this with brussel sprouts, corn and mixed veggies.  It was a hit with my kiddos and DH.  I did have some watery issues at the bottom of the pan, but no one seemed that bothered by it and we hardly had any leftovers!  Great idea for leftover veggies!  I'll make this again and again. *The biggest hit so far has been broccoli, corn and carrots. Thanks!"
442988,31683,2008-03-06,5,"Loved it!  My husband declared that this was perfect comfort food.  The quality of the dish depends on what you put in it, doesn't it?  I used a ton of veggies -- 7 different kinds, and probably closer to five cups than three.  To keep it WW-friendly, I used Trader Joe's low-calorie wheat bread, skipped the margarine, used skim milk, and reduced-fat smoked Gouda and reduced-fat sharp cheddar.  And I topped it with a quarter cup of fresh grated Parmesan.  It was delicious!  Thanks so much for posting this."
167179,31683,2008-03-13,4,"I made this last night for the first time.  I used cauliflower, brocoli, and green beans and I used a blend of swiss and sharp cheddar cheese.  It is a mild dish; the texture and flavor reminded me a lot of the flavor and texture of quiche. Next time, I am going to try adding some onions and spinach and more cheese on the top.  Still a pretty good recipe.  Thank you for submitting it!"
323328,31683,2008-03-20,4,"We had this this evening and its pretty darn good!  I used a dense white bread, parmesan cheese in the mixture (probably closer to a cup), and sharp cheddar on the top to cover.  I also used skim milk and it was fine with that.
I keep a container in my freezer where I dump all the little bits or leftover veggies that I usually use in vegetable soup, so I just defrosted that and it was about 4 cups, so I just dumped it all in.  I think next time I'll be sure there are some onions in there, but overall it was very good.    I think spinach would be great as well as cauliflower.   The corn was also tasty in there!!
Thanks for sharing a great recipe for using up my veggie leftovers.  DH says its a keeper!"
61010,31683,2008-08-24,4,"This is a very good casserole on the order of a quiche with no crust.  It's versatile in that it adapts to any vegies, and I used leftover corn and peas, broad beans and zucchini.  I served it with tomato soup and it was a quick and tasty dinner."
281330,31683,2008-11-03,4,"Very good.  I used broccoli, red pepper, onions and snow peas.  Also, for cheese I used brie in the filling and chÃ¨vre noir on top.  It was a nice combination.
Thank you."
307059,31683,2009-01-03,4,"My family enjoyed this casserole.  Although my husband said it could use a little more flavor.  Next time I will use 1/2 evaporated milk as you suggested. I used brocolli, cauliflower and carrots for the vegetables.  Thanks for sharing."
317631,31683,2009-08-03,5,"My impression when looking over the ingredients was there wasn't much (besides salt) to accent the taste of the vegetables. So I added a chicken bullion cube to the milk, and also stirred in a blend of Italian seasonings, which included sage. My first thought when taking my first bite? Omigod - this is vegetable STUFFING! Really, just like stuffing at Thanksgiving, except instead of just bread and herbs and whatever other things some people put in, it's chock-a-block with vegetables. I think I would have found it a bit on the bland side if I hadn't included the extras that I did. As it was, it was really tasty comfort food. With all the cheese in there, I think you could also decrease (perhaps even omit?) the margarine. Shall try that next time and see how it turns out. In any case, I will probably even up the sage a bit - love that unexpected little savoury taste of Thanksgiving."
215898,31683,2009-10-07,4,Very good and easy to make!
1376400,31683,2009-10-24,5,"I altered the recipe quite a bit in term of flavoring but used the same amount of the backbone ingredients (milk, eggs, bread, cooked veggie). I made 2/3 of the recipe, used butter instead of margarine, added a cube of chicken bouillon, sprinkled the mixture with italian seasoning (as one of the other reviewers had suggested), used 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp pepper for this 2/3 of the recipe. For cheese, i used half asiago and half medium cheddar."

252084,31683,2010-05-01,4,"Delicious, and even better texture when reheated the next day!!  I think 4-qt is a typo; mine fit in a 2-qt even with a little extra bread.  Picture seems to show a 2-qt. casserole dish.   And friends, please, use butter.  Margerine is NOT better for you and doesn't taste as good!  ;-)"
1800198467,31683,2013-11-05,1,"Mine wasn&#039;t creamy, it was more lumpy and mushy. Did I do something wrong?"
209154,56152,2007-08-23,5,"Perfect!  I used whole wheat and they still turned out great.  For small crackers, bake for 6 min.  Next time I will probably triple the recipe and use larger cookie cutters.  Thanks, fubaraed fubara."
101376,56152,2007-09-16,4,"Very good! 
I used larger cookie cutters than I would have liked, but I wanted to use animal shapes LOL
I couldn't NOT put a skiff of white frosting on them with the colored sprinkles!!
Fun cookie , and not overly sweet at all .. I actually only used the frosting for the picture , I doubt I'd put it on anymore cookies .. I like 'em just the way the recipe states them to be! 
Thanks!!!"
31420,56152,2009-01-09,5,"These were delicious.  The kids loved them.  I used 1 cup of cheerios instead of the oatmeal because I didn't have oatmeal.  I think they blend into flout a little bit easier than the oatmeal, too.  I also used regular milk.  My kids are begging me for more, so I'll be making them again, and again, and again."
1371186,56152,2009-11-04,4,Very tasty and very easy to make.  I liked this not too sweet recipe and the kids agreed!  My toddlers loved these little crackers.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used plain yogurt instead.  The dough was a little sticky so I ended up using a little bit more flour.  This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.
50053,56152,2011-02-05,4,"These were good, but not sweet at all.  I was hoping for a lightly sweet cracker, but still enjoyed these."
272343,145890,2005-12-21,3,had a problem rolling part was easy but wend i added the filling it didn't look like itshould have maybe i did something wrong it taste great but i couldn't bring it as a giht like i wanted to. felt bad about that made three and all came out the same 
101823,123777,2005-06-18,5,"Great burgers!  I loved the blue cheese and bacon combo.  For Hubby, a non-blue cheese lover, I subbed Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb cheese for the blue.  He devoured it quickly.  We topped our burgers with Boca Pat's Tasty Topping for Burgers (recipe #88103) and slices of fresh tomato.  They were a simple, but delicious meal for a busy night. "
169430,357327,2009-04-02,5,"Another great sandwich from this chef. I used hazelnut poppy seed bread, fat free cheeses,  turkey bacon and about 3/4 tsp of fat free sour cream on one slice of bread for my single sandwich. Low fat and scrumptious. Made for PAC, Spring 09."
756627,357327,2010-04-30,5,"Great sandwich.  I do not like onion so did not add it, but rest kept as is.  i didn't think the sour cream would work, but it did.  It reminded me of a BLT in many ways.  I would make it again :)"
705251,467315,2013-02-08,5,Annacia dear - you have a truly wonderful cookie recipe here!  I took some (not all of course) to work to share and everyone is raving about these gems.  They are a firm/crisp cookie in the end which makes it a fantastic dunking cookie for those coffee addicts like me.  I tried one warm from the oven and it immediately reminded me of a snickerdoodle without all the sweetness but then you put that glaze on them and boy does that take it over the top!  Don't skip that glaze!  Found and made for Rookie Tag Game.  Thanks for a keeper!
573325,286484,2011-11-16,4,"This is very easy and quick to prepare and makes for a delish breakkie. I loved how healthy this is and how nice the spices complemented the banana flavour.

After a short search in Kato&#039;s recipe I found that this is the perfect recipe.&lt;br/&gt;I prepared this this for 4 peoples and we all enjoyed it very much ... it was so good in 15 minutes all was gone!&lt;br/&gt;The recipe was perfect, the dough had the right consistence even after the minor change I did using milk instead of cream.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks a lot for this dessert/snack! :)"
227978,503475,2017-08-29,5,"My goodness, this is one delicious baked pancake. The cinnamon/sugar mixture was just enough to sweeten the apples but not so sweet as to make it seem like a dessert. I bought enough apples to make a whole batch, but my apple supply seemed to have mysteriously dwindled to only 2 when it was time to make this recipe. So I made 1/3 recipe and baked it in my small (8-inch) cast iron skillet, and it made enough for 3 large portions (could even get by with 4 portions for smaller appetites). I have a hot spot in my oven and I kept turning my skillet to keep it from browning too fast. Despite my efforts, the edge all around seemed to have scorched a tad. But nonetheless it still tasted wonderful. I'd happily serve this Danish Apple Pancake to company or even for a special occasion, because it's much better than a plain pancake and makes breakfast a special occasion. Thanks, Baby Kato.

523263,288745,2008-10-05,3,"I made this last night. I loved everything about it except that the sun-dried tomatoes made the dish exceedingly salty, even after having rinsed the sun-dried tomatoes. Next time I am going to try using sun-dried tomatoes very sparingly or re-hydrating dried ones, rather than using the ones in oil. I may also experiment with a little less butter and see if the taste and form remain the same."
1206102,288745,2009-08-07,4,"All my favorite flavors, and so tasty with a glass of wine!  I divided this into two tortes and froze one for later enjoyment."
59064,11164,2004-10-09,4,"The idea is good but even onion rings and garlic butter can't save blanched zucchini. But it was a very good try! Certainly looks good and it would make a good quick side dish.
The younger the zucchini the better, and I suggest homegrown or organic produce."
2640133,11164,2013-07-23,4,"It&#039;s not gourmet or anything, but it was quick and easy to make. What I loved  is that it was all ingredients I had laying around in my kitchen, and it made for a fast quick lunch I could make my husband.  And he approved, told me he would like it again some time!"

59780,85492,2006-05-15,5,"A great, quick, and delicious side dish to go with our spaghetti and meatsauce meal. We all enjoyed this and I will use this recipe again!"
121690,85492,2004-05-26,5,Very good and took only minutes to make.
268426,85492,2006-06-14,5,"Awesome! ;-)  I made one version with parmesan and another with feta cheese.  The feta version was FAR superior ... almost to die for.  I love how steaming the asparagus makes it easy to cut.  I made this with hamburgers, corn on the cob and potato salad - traditionally more yummy foods than asparagus - and I found myself going back for seconds for the asparagus and nothing else!  "
391048,85492,2007-02-22,5,Excellent!!! Will make this every time we have Asparagus on the menu. Works great with canned. Just drain the liquid first.

144897,85492,2008-02-05,5,Yum! I had no idea I liked asparagus until I tried this recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing it.  I like my asparagus pretty soft so I double the cooking time and add a little bit of cold water to the pot about half way through to complete the steaming. Love this! :)
5060,85492,2010-03-15,5,"Very good, very tasty!!
I will be making this again often, thanks for posting."
307313,85492,2010-04-05,5,"I have never cooked asparagus before or even really liked it, but my boyfriend loves it, so I agreed to cook it.  This recipe is awesome and so easy.  I will be cooking and eating asparagus again."
239197,251518,2007-09-11,5,"I made this cake yesterday and it is half gone.  There are only two of us.  I found it so tender that I did not try to remove it from the pan, so just frosted the top and topped with walnut meats.  It is delicious.  Will make many times.  The leftover frosting will go great on cinnamon rolls or cookies.  Thanks Crafty Lady."
204024,251518,2008-08-08,5,This is a great cake.  The frosting goes so well with the cake.  The flavor is great together. I followed the ingredients per recipe.  Made for BT
461834,251518,2008-10-05,5,"This deserves more than 5 stars!!  I made this as written, using to large bananas (which made a cup) and the rest as written.  I was taking it to a BBQ, so I made it in a 13 X 9 inch foil pan so I could leave the rest with the hosts.  I only made 1/2 of the frosting and it worked out great!!  This was the moist banana cake I have ever had and everyone raved about the cake.  Thanks so much for posting this keeper recipe Crafty Lady!!  Made for bevy tag."
1020526,251518,2008-11-21,5,"Someone brought this to work today.  I don't like bananas, but this is tasty.  You can't even tell it's a cake mix."
778986,251518,2008-12-12,5,"I also saw this in Kraft Mag.. This is a no fail cake! I have made it several times. The only changes I made are, added 6 drops yellow food coloring to batter, and added 1 tea. vanilla. You can't go wrong with this one. Thanks!"
315565,251518,2009-04-07,4,This was quick to do and made a pretty good sized cake and will be great for the the kids for tonights dessert. I used 3 very very ripe bananas and added a handful of chopped nuts to the batter - an all round great success so thanks.
917568,251518,2009-07-05,5,"Marvelous, dense cake.  I had a chocolate cake mix in the pantry so I used that, and instead of walnuts I stirred a few spoonfuls of peanut butter into the frosting.  Mine took about 45 minutes to bake completely through in a bundt pan.  The banana taste was very pronounced, and the cake got demolished at the barbecue we just came from.  Also, this recipe lends itself very well to ""healthifying"" as I used non-fat sour cream, lower fat cream cheese and only about 1 tablespoon of butter in the frosting.  Much lower in calories and still so delicious that nobody even noticed.  An excellent addition to the recipe book."
441981,251518,2009-08-12,5,"I didn't make this, but my aunt did and brought it over, it was wonderfully flavored and moist. I might up the banana to 1 1/2 cups because we like a lot of banana taste, but it was fine as is! It was dense and the frosting stands up well to the texture. My dh had it and said he liked it better than my from scratch cheesecake I had made a few days before. Even though I was a little bummed (come on, a boxed cake mix?!) It's nice to know something so good is so easy to make!"
464080,251518,2010-06-03,5,"Downright amazing cake that couldn't be easier.  Mine was super light and delicious.  Used light sour cream with great results.  Did not frost ours, simply dusted it with some powdered sugar.   I made 12 cupcakes and 1 eight inch round cake. . .both were done in 25 minutes. This is a keeper."
315565,355510,2011-03-30,5,Marvellous recipe for times of glut. I had 2 big bags of Buerre Bosc pears so used them in this recipe. I love the addition of lemon here.
17608,19104,2003-08-13,5,"Awesome!  My husband has been bugging me to make crepes for dinner for months and I haven't gotten around to doing it, I finally did and they were great.  The batter was so easy, I think the hardest part was letting it sit for an hour before I could start cooking, but it gave me a chance to make a nice filling with bacon, onions and mushrooms.  Thanks again Bergy!"
155244,19104,2004-08-06,5,"These were great! It was the first time I've made crepes and the recipe was easy and delicious. The crepes were moist and had a great texture- better than the ones I've had at restaurants. 
  Definitely use a non-stick skillet as mine were almost on the verge of sticking. 
  I filled them with Turkish Eggplant Cream #95402 and drizzled them with a spicy marinara. Yum! 
  My five year old son loved the crepes so much he asked me to make them for breakfast with honey. I have the batter waiting in the fridge for when he wakes up. . I put less salt, a little sugar, and some vanilla this time. Thanks Bergy!"
153188,19104,2005-04-07,5,"Super easy to make, beings it was my first time with crepes I was a little skeptical, but they turned out wonderful.  Thanks!"
131126,19104,2008-08-25,5,"RSC #12 listed prepared crepes as a contest ingredient so I used this recipe to make the crepes I would need.  I made a double batch one day, layered them in wax paper to separate per your suggestion, and froze in zip bags in sets of 6.  They froze beautifully.  Thank you for the clear instructions and sharing a tasty recipe!"
936241,19104,2008-09-13,5,The flavor was great and these cooked up nicely.  The only problem I had was my crepes came out a bit thicker than I prefer.  Next time I will thin them down a bit before cooking.
163986,19104,2010-05-23,5,"This is the exact same recipe that I have been using for years and years.  I was going to post my recipe one day and proceeded to check to see if there was another one like mine.  Lo and behold...Bergy's is just like mine--exactly--so I didn't need to post it.  I would like to say that these are delicious.  The recipe makes quite a few and they freeze wonderfully.  There is just my hubby and I now, so I do freeze them with wax paper between and then pop them into a zip-lock bag so we can have crepes filled with all the wonderful fillings anytime we want.  When my granddaughter was little she used to take the warm crepes and sprinkle confectioners sugar on them and just eat them like that.  She loved it when I made them.  I had to cut her off snitching them because she would make a huge dent in the pile.  Thanks Bergy!"
394085,207134,2007-06-25,5,"Delicious and beautiful. I made half the recipe.  Unlike many fritattas, this one was not watery at all. Rich and still healthy -- how can one beat that?? It also reheated remarkably well in a very low microwave. The only thing I was uncertain about was the timing of adding the basil.
I did add a couple of strips of torn up peppered bacon. Thanks for offering this; it's yummy."
1680722,207134,2011-06-09,5,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Easy, tasty and in the oven. Today I was too tired for stirring in pots! I love cooking in the oven, this makes the life easier. <br/>I've served this simply with bread. In this way we got a complete meal.<br/>Thanks a lot for posting this recipe. Done for ZWT7."
55122,67142,2003-11-13,1,"Tried this and had to throw it out.  I had the recipe for this cobbler somewhere, but misplaced it so I tried this one.  I do believe my original recipe calls for self-rising flour, not all-purpose.  Also, before it finished baking, I had to drain some of the liquid off.  I would drain the liquid from one of the cans of fruit and use half as much butter."
336058,209247,2007-02-12,4,"This was very easy to put together, yet difficult for us untried crepe makers!:)  Actually, the directions are very well set out.  The only thing I missed is how long to cook it on the second side.  I've always had problems flipping pancakes and esp. the thin ones.  I used a 10 inch skillet and had to re-spray it (and wipe) after each crepe.  They weren't pretty, but they tasted good!  I may use this recipe and try it the way I make Bavarian Pancakes (similar to a crepe, but a little thicker.)  The kids had theirs with just powdered sugar inside (we rolled them.)  I used jam.  Will try the filling recipe you have sometime too.  Thanks!"
53959,209247,2007-02-15,5,OH MY!!!!! This was AWESOME!!! I made them for breakfast for Valentines Day and my family just raved over them. This is a definate keeper. I also used the crepe filling #209347. YUMMMM!!!
341142,209247,2007-02-17,5,Crepe-tacular:-) technique is the thing here and I obviously lack it as well as a crepe pan. I used an ordinary non stick frying pan and the results were ....not that attractive. However I have the same problem with pancakes. My husband does a better job. Anyways after rolling they looked halfway decent and tasted super. Great with strawberry preserves or chocolate sauce and bananas or simply dusted with confectioners sugar whatever your preference.
102526,209247,2007-04-06,4,"My husband gave this three stars, but I upped it to 4 stars because they were so easy to make.  The blender method is just so easy, you can't screw it up.  I used a ""crepe-maker"" not a crepe pan which makes it easy for me.  You could really use this recipe for almost any dessert or breakfast crepe you would want to make.  We did not taste the banana super-strong.  I served with a variety of toppings, including bananas, nutella, mashed strawberries, chocolate syrup, and cinnamon-sugar.  We liked nutella and sliced bananas best."
383346,209247,2007-06-17,5,"My banana was very ripe.  And the flavor was perfect.  If you like bananas, then you'll like these crepes.  But in fact, I don't really like bananas but this I liked lol  It's so easy to do.  Made for the ZWT 3"
89831,209247,2008-01-30,5,"very good, the banana added to the flavor, I only had a small banana to use so the flavor was not that noticible, I suggest to use a large one, they fryed up nicely in my small crepe pan, thanks for sharing CD!"
2002153858,209247,2018-05-15,5,"using blender, so easy and quick, done in 5 mins, taste great too. thank you"
68460,190939,2006-12-08,5,"I loved this sandwich! I also love recipes that I can make JUST for myself!  I mashed my rather small avocado, added the juice from about a half of a lime and some sea salt.  I spread it on very nice, toasted whole wheat bread, added a butter lettuce leaf, topped with another slice of bread and away I went.  I had this with oolong iced tea and orange segments for a very nice lunch today.  Thanks for posting this de RochÃ©....I love quick, simple, delicious recipes and this one fits the bill perfectly :)"
89831,190939,2006-12-14,4,"This was okay, for our taste it needed som ""jazzing up"" my DH loves avacados in any form! thanks de Roche!"
74652,190939,2006-12-15,5,These are comfort food for me!  When I was little we had an Avacodo tree in California and my Mother would make these. When I moved to the East cosast most people had never tried Avacodo but now they are plentiful in our grocery stores.  I love this sandwich with some sprouts on a good whole grain bread (very California!  Thanks for sharing!
141293,190939,2006-12-17,5,"Well what can I say.  This is simple and delicious.  Make sure you use a nice, fresh bread that you like because this will make or break the sandwich.  I LOVE avocado and this showcases it's buttery, smooth and delicious properties.  Just plain great!"
125640,190939,2006-12-17,4,"This is the first time I've ever made anything with avocado, and it was easier to work with than I expected. I opted to use the salt, but not the lime, and I was surprised how much more I like avocado with just a little salt added. Next time I'd like to try it with a little garlic as well, as it sounded good to me, but I was trying to resist the urge to make changes. I thought the sandwich was okay, but seemed like it was missing something (probably because I got used to eating avocado, turkey, and swiss sandwiches at work), so after a couple bites, I threw on a couple slices of provolone and that made it taste better to me. I think next time I'll be just making it with cheese to begin with and grilling it in our sandwich grill. Thanks for sharing. I don't eat enough fruit and really need to find more ways that I enjoy it. I think I'll be making variations of this fairly often as it's cheap, easy, and tastes good."
246936,190939,2006-12-18,5,I love avocado sandwhiches! So simple but so tastey!
352597,190939,2007-01-05,5,"We love avacado so this was a perfect sandwich for us. I also add some garlic and a little olive oil, together with the salt."
37449,190939,2007-01-05,5,"I love avocados and this is an easy, simple and delicious way to use them! I used the lime and the salt and it was so good! I opted to use just one piece of bread, which I toasted. Thanks!"
68960,190939,2007-02-16,5,I love avocado and especially on toast. Today I served with some lime sprinkled over the top as well as salt and freshly ground black pepper.
340141,190939,2007-02-22,4,I loved it.  I added a pinch of garlic powder and onion powder.  Thanks for a great idea.
595112,190939,2008-05-25,4,"I've made something similar, but I add a slice of provalone cheese and use Spike seasoning instead of salt."
710809,190939,2009-12-10,5,"Thank you for posting this simple recipe and useful information from your Grandmother.  Living in a climate where avacados do not grow, and can at times be pricey, I am not aware of all the things they can be used  for other than in guacamole.  I had never even heard of an avacado until I was about 13.  I did eat this on whole wheat bread and loved it!"
53425,22320,2005-01-11,5,"This is lovely! I used butter, and savory instead of tarragon with just a hint of sage. I did put in the cheese as I have some chevre to use up, but it wasn't really noticeable, except perhaps in the texture, which was smooth and spreadable. Really delicious - we like this a lot. "
54233,22320,2008-07-14,0,"Soooo good.  The first time I made it my husband and I ate the whole thing.  It was our meal for the evening.  Everywhere I take it, it is a hit.  I love it warm with crackers.  Brings out the flavors."
111520,82600,2007-02-18,4,Heavenly! So easy...(except for picking & washing all those watercress leaves). I added a sprinkling of nutmeg and black Hawaiian sea salt. Also cut a tangerine in half and ate with the asparagus.  Also excellent over steamed broccoli!
496803,247103,2011-09-27,4,"This was really good!  I love the combination of eggs, cheese, and salsa; and this one did not dissapoint.  I cut the recipe in half, and it was still a huge portion for one- next time I'll only make a third.  I didn't have rotel, so used the salsa option. This would also be great with green onions on top.  Thanks for a great breakfast!"
147706,161039,2006-09-27,5,"Wow! This bread was fabulous! Great molasses flavor. Very moist. Perfect for tea or coffee break.I would have taken a picture, but it was eaten too fast. I took it to work and it was gone before lunch. Thank you so much for this great recipe. "
128473,161039,2006-09-29,5,"This bread was amazing. It had a gingerbread texture, smelled like banana bread and tasted like spice bread. The flavours all blend well together and you could actually taste banana, molasses and spices. Very nice with a cup of tea. Thanks so much for sharing. "
163112,161039,2006-10-15,5,This is delicious bread!  The flavors are perfectly balanced.  We all loved it!  Thanks!  
546012,161039,2007-11-02,5,"yum!
 lightened this up.  i used half ww flour, applesauce instead of butter, sf syrup instead of honey, egg beaters, and ff sour cream.
its a bit strange, but very good.
MUCH better the second day."
15851,34584,2003-07-07,2,Some people may really like this but we didn't.  The vinegar killed the natural sweetness of the strawberries and gave it an odd taste. I think that balsamic vinegar is really good in savory dishes but it just didn't do it for me in a sweet one. Sorry
30862,34584,2003-10-12,2,When the vinegar is added I marinate this recipe for 2 days and stir daily. It will make a sweet/sour taste. serve with almond bread and cream if wish.
358506,34584,2007-01-27,5,I have had this and the balsamic vinegar gives the cream a great flavor.  It brings out the flavor of the berries.
209203,161039,2008-02-16,5,"Where is the ginger?  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of powdered ginger, substituted 1/3 cup oil for the butter, and more molasses for the honey.  I also used one cup each of unbleached and whole wheat flour, adding 2 teaspoons baking powder & about 1/2 teaspoon salt (had no self-rising flour) - and a good handful of raisins at the end - and now I have a loaf of delicious bread that is moist, spicy, not too sweet and not overwhelmingly banana-y - this is definitely my new banana bread recipe.  Thank you!"
929359,161039,2008-10-26,3,"It came out way too heavy for me and I definitely think it needs a lot more leavening than the self-rising flour provides.  The taste is okay, but the texture is just so gooey/sticky that it's difficult to enjoy.  I think I can make changes to the recipe to fix it, but as-is, it just doesn't make nearly as good of a quick bread as I generally make on my own."
2545953,161039,2012-12-23,3,"Missing ginger. Smells absolutely lovely. But, it was too ""spice""y for my family and I."
156034,145831,2006-05-09,5,"Thanks to Paul's recipe, I now weigh 9125 lbs.!  Just kidding...you could really do yourself in eating these though.  The texture is great and the flavors blend together extremely well.

THANKS FOR ADDING A NEW STAPLE TO MY RECIPE STASH!!!"
297543,145831,2006-06-03,5,Loved it!! Very rich and creamy and best of all it has my favorite..crispy bacon. These are fantastic kicked up mashed potatoes.
30716,23252,2002-05-15,5,"A really different way to serve potatoes. We enjoyed this immensely. I used wheat flour instead of potato flour and dehydrated onions as I really didn't want to grate an onion myself! Thanks Mirjam, this was great."
52282,23252,2003-02-15,5,"delicious kugel, i used matzoh meal instead of potato flour, and used a whole onion. i baked this in a 13x9"" dish for 4 of us, and it disappeared. you'd think they were kugel deprived or something ."
425105,23252,2007-04-04,5,"I made this for the family sedar for Passover, so I tripled the recipe and used potato starch instead of flour. I also used a whole onion...love that onion flavor! About 2/3 of it filled a 9x13 pan well, and the last batch went into a 2 qt casserole dish. I forgot to grate the onion first, so my potatoes did discolor a little. I've heard that if you put the onion through the food processor first, then the pototoes, they won't darken. There were some leftovers, so I've been eating them for breakfast too like they were hashbrowns."
219318,23252,2007-04-10,5,"This is essentially my potato kugel recipe too.  Just like Karen67, I use potato starch instead of flour, and I also use a whole onion and a bit of extra pepper as well.  And I cut back on the oil a tad too.  A very yummy kugel!  This recipe must have made the Jewish community rounds at some point b/c I originally got it from a synagogue sisterhood cookbook published in 1977."
573325,23252,2009-02-07,5,"Wow, this is a very tasty recipe! It's super easy to put together and the result is excellent! I had some leftover sweet potato so I threw that in with the normal potato and it was very nice. I also put a little cheese on top of my kugel. I love how versatile this recipe is. I can think of so many possible variations using different vegetables and spices.
Thank you very much for sharing this, Mirj!"
1056643,23252,2009-04-11,5,Perfect potato kugel!
1162064,23252,2009-05-11,5,"The first time I made this, I ended up adding a lot of extra starch because the mixture seemed too liquidy. The result was an outstanding potato kugel that had the texture and taste of a baked latke (yum!). This is a keeper!"
125388,236547,2008-12-29,5,"Oh, this was so good!  I made this to serve with chili and this was the star of the meal.  I baked this in the oven and opened the top of the foil for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the bread.  When I removed the loaf from the oven, I sliced it lengthwise from top to bottom to form smaller slices that were easier to grab."
464080,316172,2008-09-16,4,"A SUPER easy dinner to say the least.  I used fresh, but frozen, tamales removed from their husks.  I cooked them on low and after 4 hours all of the sauce was gone, so I poured some enchilada sauce over the top and cooked them for another 2 hours.  Wished I would have put even MORE enchilada sauce on top.  These were very tasty."
27443,316172,2009-01-23,5,"This was so good, I even had some.
My dad just loves tamales (from the can.) He lives alone and I often go over to cook up some meals for him.
I knew he would want tamales, that night so wanted to dress them up abit. Thanks for sharing."
323186,388065,2009-09-15,5,"This was rather fun!  I hoped it wasn't going to leak all over my oven, but it didn't!  Nice way to do carrots with a lovely flavour to them, the sauce reduces to an aromatic glaze.

It took about an hour for my carrots to be tender, but I had used normal carrots cut into batons, maybe that affected the cooking time.

Nice recipe, thanks, swissms!"
286566,388065,2009-10-04,5,"Great easy way to do carrots.  I used 1/2lb of regulaar carrots and cut them into batons and followed the recipe for a half serve which was plenty for 3 of us as one of the sides to dinner.  Thank you swissms, made for Every Day A Holiday."
601528,388065,2009-10-13,3,"An easy way to cook carrots.  Mine could have used a bit more time in the oven, however.  They were a bit crunchy still.  Unfortunately the rest of the food was done so we ate them that way."
2001436530,388065,2017-03-28,4,"These were good. I cooked them at 400 for an hour. Although if I make them again, I will leave out the cumin, because the rest of my family never likes cumin, and this was no exception."
420929,97416,2007-03-01,4,Loved it and we make a lot of grilled asparagus.  I added a little bit of garlic powder to it also and used grey salt at the end.  Yum.
37636,97416,2004-08-17,5,Fantastic! Easy to make and has a great flavor from the rosemary and garlic. I put these in a marinade bag in the morning and grilled them that night. Thanks for posting!
47907,97416,2005-04-04,5,Excellent!  I used asparagus from my asparagus patch and marinated it in the fridge all day.  It's so flavorful and easy to grill.  Even my veggie-hating DH tried it and liked it ~ that's high praise right there!  Thanks for posting a keeper!
122235,97416,2006-02-19,5,We all loved this recipe.  The combination of rosemary & lemon really complimented the asparagus nicely.   
278516,97416,2007-04-06,5,"Tasty stuff:) I'm not normally one for asparagus so this one pleasantly surprised me. I put chili in everything, so i couldn't help but put some in. I served with Recipe #161257 and Recipe #161189 & the flavours went together really nicely."
134707,97416,2007-05-16,5,"This is Awsome! My boyfriend said this is the best asparagus that he has ever tasted. A really good combination of flavors! I did grate the lemon peel in the marinade to inhance the flavor, and still added the whole lemon and juice."
400991,97416,2007-05-24,4,This was really good. I marinated the asparagus for about 3 or 4 hours and it was great will do it again.
452355,97416,2007-10-21,3,"We really wanted to love this recipe, given the ease of preparation and the fact that I love all of the ingredients listed.  However, while we liked it, we did not feel as though the marinade came through in the flavor of the asparagus (with the exception of the lemon).  I marinaded this for 2 and a half hours.  Perhaps the flavors would have been more apparent if I marinaded longer."
655996,97416,2010-04-16,5,"The flavors blended wonderfully together. The lemon, garlic and rosemary combination was a hit. Marinated for 3 1/2 hours. Will make these again. Thank you for a delicious recipe."
4470,97416,2010-04-26,5,What a great recipe -I marinated it all day. I did the asparagus on my griddler.  It only took 3 minutes on the pre heated grill.Do not over cook it! This recipe will be repeated -  Our local asparagus is just coming in noiw  Thanks Rita for a super recipe
23466,97416,2010-12-26,4,"Easy to make and great for the holidays.  But, a little bitter - next time, I'll reduce the lemon juice or use vinegar instead."
179456,112725,2005-03-12,5,"I've been having this every afternoon for the past few days...It's a great pick-me-up when you start to ""bonk"" in the afternoon.  I used regular, Sue Bee honey.  "
121985,112725,2005-05-02,5,Very Tasty and nutritionally speaking a very good for you treat.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks for the easy snack idea and energy boost.
57695,112725,2005-10-12,5,Ate these this morning before i had to go to Dr. I used orange falvored honey. Yummy and filling! thanks!!
65197,112725,2005-10-15,5,"This is very tastey!
I'm always looking for easy-good-for-you breakfasts...this one fits the bill!!  We have an over abundance of honey (DS sends it from Calif..honey made in orange orchards).
Thank you!"
149363,112725,2005-10-15,5,"I made this for my 5 year olds breakfast and she just loved it!
I just gave her a banana, and a little cup of honey and let her dip away.
Super idea, thanks for posting!"
71324,112725,2005-10-17,5,"I had this after my exercise this morning as a pic me up. Anaemic or not, this is a tasty healthy snack or breakfast. You're right these two ingredients make a great addition to any smoothie as well!"
224740,112725,2005-10-17,4,I used very ripe bananas and nice organic honey - it was very sweet and nice.
189643,112725,2005-10-19,5,I had this for breakfast-a great energy boost! Thanks!
191990,112725,2005-10-20,5,"Yeah, this is the most satisfying breakfast Ive had in a long time!"
151325,112725,2005-10-24,4,"A bit too sweet for me, but I'm sure kids will love this oh, so healthy snack."
74652,112725,2005-10-26,5,Great for a quick and healthy breaffast!  I always have these ingredients on hand.  Thanks!
104295,112725,2006-01-13,5,"It was one of those ""I have 30 seconds to get out of this house on time and I haven't had breakfast yet"" mornings.  Broke a banana up into a cup, poured a bit of honey on the top, and ate it with a fork.  Yummy and fast.  Thanks Rita!"
46545,112725,2006-01-13,5,"So simple and yet so good. It really does seem to give you a little boost when you need it! This is very sweet, but you can adjust and use less honey like I did.  I sliced a banana, then topped each piece with a bit of raw local honey.  The second time I made this I sprinkled them with a little ground flax seeds like mama's kitchen suggested.  Seems like  I crave this stuff now, and have it almost every day!"
305200,112725,2006-06-05,4,"This tasty treat was nice and healthy, I would like to thank you for sharing it with me. It makes a perfect breakfast and I look forward to trying more in the future. Thanks!"
209747,112725,2006-06-22,5,Update... Made this AGAIN! LOVE IT! Not just for breakfast... an ANYTIME pick me up. I added some Flax seeds for an EXTRA boost! YUM! Thanks Rita..........How easy is this? I drizzled the honey on my cut bananas and had them for breakfast with toast and milk. Great quick nutrition. I will experiment with this and try topping it with a spinkling of flax seed and maybe some spices like cinnamon- which is said to enhace brain activity! I could use that! My dd says- hey this is a great college kid breakfast! As she grabbed the breakfast I made for myself and ran for the door- on her way to meet her prof! Grrr so locked the door and I made another bowl! 
269521,112725,2006-06-22,5,Nice mid morning picker-uupper!  Added to my orange smootie!
43083,112725,2006-06-24,5,QUICK & easy! My 4 yr old loved it! Thanks Rita! :) 
281701,112725,2006-06-25,5,"This made a nice pick-me-up snack this afternoon, when I usually start feeling groggy.  Simple and quick.  The bananas tasted great with the honey!  Thanks, too, for the health lesson!"
193516,112725,2006-06-25,4,"I had this for breakfast this morning.  I used alfalfa/clover honey which is a fairly light honey.  I think that a deep honey is required for this dish.  The light honey just added sweetness without really any quality flavor which I missed.  Still a good snack which I also sprinkled with ground flax seeds.  A darker, richer flavored honey would be delicious.  In fact I think banana drizzled in something sweet but even more flavorful like molasses would be delicious! :)"
28729,112725,2006-06-26,5,"I made a smoothie out of this and it was so good. I added a couple of strawberries to it, had a couple left that I didn't want to waste. This was better than a banana split. Quite addicting too!"
185105,112725,2006-06-27,5,"Very, very nice!  My kids adored this easy recipe!  OMG.....I can't believe I never thought of this myself!  Thank you so much for sharing this simple snack....It's a keeper for sure, and my 7 year old son has already asked me when I'm going to get more bananas!!!  YIKES!  :)"
276833,112725,2006-06-28,5,"Great Breakfast Drink.  I added the honey dipped bananas to my usual breakfast smoothie of soy milk, protein powder, wheat germ, and cinnamon.  Thanks for posting."
314579,112725,2006-06-29,5,Why have I never done this before!!  Been looking for a quick breakfast and this is it!  Am going to try it with plain yogurt next time and really eat healthy!!  Thanks!
67728,112725,2006-07-01,5,"This made a nice quick breakfast for a ""grumpy tummy"" day (I get really nauseous when I don't get enough sleep, which has definitely been happening lately). I'll have to try this in a smoothie next time (maybe once my stomach says it's ready for more elaborate things lol). Thanks for posting!"
145352,112725,2006-07-01,5,Delicious!!!
212417,112725,2006-08-11,5,"This was perfect!!! After a long day of travelling and not wanting to cook....this was quick and easy to throw together. I sliced a banana, sprinkled it with a little cinnamon, and topped it with some honey!!!! YUMMY!!! So simple yet soooo delish!! Thank you for this treat!!"
261027,112725,2006-09-14,5,"Honestly, I have the same opinion as everyone else!  It is sooo simple but ever since I found this recipe I've had this with some oatmeal EVERY morning for breakfast!!  Amazing!  Adding cinnamon is also outstanding!  Thanks!!  "
322326,112725,2006-11-05,5,"i have this quite often at school when i don't like the hot option or if the cereals not gf. thanks for posting, its really yummy!!!
Miss Pixie x x x"
157102,112725,2006-11-18,5,"Way too simple to count as a recipe, but man, it's good. Like sprinkling an apple with cinnamon, or tossing a few pine nuts into your salad...sometimes the simple little touches make all the difference!"
373817,112725,2007-01-18,5,"Simple, fast and delicious! I've ate this for breakfast the past 2 mornings, and I love it! I think I even got my husband addicted..... :) Thanks!"
227607,112725,2007-06-08,5,I had this for lunch today(added some pineapple) and it was very refreshing. MMMMM.  made for zwt 07
222055,112725,2007-06-09,5,My ds always has dark circles under his eyes and I always think it's because he doesn't eat well. Well he sure has no problem eating this and I sure hope it helps! It will definetly be a regular for him. Thank you Rita!!!
288218,112725,2007-06-19,4,"That was my breakfast today, and I enjoyed very much. I always have a problem with my iron so if thats a way to built my blood, I'm so happy. Thanks Rita for the tip!"
248023,112725,2007-10-06,5,"Yummy!  I just bought some bananas and wanted a quick snack before dinner... I'm not anemic, but love the health benefits of raw organic honey and bananas... I sliced up my banana and drizzled on some organic honey (the best stuff on earth)... I could eat this for dessert with a glass of milk... Thanks for sharing!!!"
140943,112725,2008-02-24,0,"This recipe is so yummy.  I've been making the same thing for my kids as a healthy snack for years - but i cut the bananas into bite size pieces, drizzle with honey and sprinkle with cinnamon (cinnamon is another of natures miracle foods).  Sometimes, if its an after dinner treat, I'll even sprinkle on a little sugar.  I've even tried chocolate syrup and peanut butter bananas too, those are YUM!"
346583,112725,2008-06-05,5,"As promised in September 2007 I would keep you posted how this worked for me.  I am taking this on a regular basis and I feel great! No more doctor's prescriptions for me! This is delicious,healthy and natural and does me a world of good. I recommend to give it a try and see the result for yourself."
135566,112725,2008-07-02,5,"I made this for dessert last night and I loved the combo of honey and banana.  I'll be making this all the time now as it is not only guilt-free, but it soothes my sweet tooth."
28177,112725,2011-02-12,5,"I've just been through a series of intravenous iron infusions and want to keep my iron stores up.  Unfortunately, I'm allergic to bananas so I don't eat them on a regular basis, but can get away with it occasionally.  We always have them around for DD though, so I think I'll enjoy mine this way every time I treat myself.  I used Chilean raw honey that FloridaNative sent me in the honey swap and I have Demelza to thank for sending me the recipe link.  Thanks for posting, Rita!  :)"
593927,112725,2011-12-13,5,Healthy if local raw honey is used. Preferably organic. Heated honey which is pasteurized stuff from the regular grocery store is a poison to the body as stated in Ayurveda. I may have used less honey. I sliced the ripe banana and added chopped walnuts on top for a quick healthy breakfast. I do know honey contains iron but does it really have that much? Anyway raw local honey is so good for us and like other reviewers I found this gave me energy. I will keep this in mind to use again.
573325,112725,2012-02-15,5,"This is awesome! I loved this as a healthy little snack using a very creamy organic honey and organic bananas. The flavour combination is wonderful and Ill surely make this again. Thank you so much for sharing this winner, Rita! <br/>Made and reviewed for the Honey Tag Game in the Spain/Portugal Forum February 2012."
302689,370556,2009-05-20,5,"Hubby said this was too tart but I think he's just not a fan of passionfruit. I enjoy the depth of flavour, more 'special' than plain apple crumble! Instead of pre-packaged Anzac biscuits (couldn't find vegan version) I made up the basic Anzac mixture and put it on top of the crumble wet and cooked for an extra 5 minutes so it was like a cookie baking ON the crumble... Very good! Thanks for the recipe Scarlett! Made for the Australian leg of ZWT5."
95743,142269,2005-11-14,5,"this made a very pretty and very tasty presentation for big ""kids"" when  left in the squash shell and sprinkled with nutmeg and cinnamon ."
121185,158429,2006-05-17,5,"Yummy, yummy, yummy! This were delish!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  The addition of nutmeg was perfect!  The only thing I would change is 1) cook for 5-7 minutes LESS, they came out almost over done and 2) soften the cream cheese before mixing - it was impossible to combine it without making a HUGE mess of pow. sug. all over the counter. I also added about 1 T smart balance margarine to the frosting."
117781,158429,2006-10-06,4,"Very good. More like a muffin than a cupcake in texture, but very nice flavor nonetheless.  We weren't crazy about the frosting, it was easy to make with my kitchenaid, but it had a rather runny texture and just an off taste in general...probably because we love the full fat, full butter type cream cheese frosting.  We enjoyed this healthier alternative. Thanks!"
1842686,158429,2011-03-02,0,"Excellent recipe! I've made banana cake with cream cheese icing, but I've never been much of cupcake maker.. however, this recipe was as easy as it was tasty! Also... this is the first recipe I've made the yielded the number of cupcakes that it was supposed to yield. All in all, awesomeness!"
1775187,441514,2010-12-25,5,"I love this simple recipe.  What a great combination of sweet and salty.  I made these for the first time just a few days ago.  My husband and I actually planned to share some with his parents, but that never happened!  We ate them all, oops."
226066,213279,2007-06-27,4,This is a simple tasty side dish!  Loved the basil with the carrots.  Would be even better with some fresh basil!!  Thanks lazyme!
286566,213279,2009-04-17,5,"I scaled this back to 1 serve for me (I steamed the carrots for 10 minutes in the steamer) I had melted the butter and stirred in fresh sliciely sweet basil and then just before serving gave it a quick 10 second (750W microwave) to intensify the flavour and stirred the carrott into it and it was delcious with the fish, baked potatoe and steamed veg.  Thank you lazyme."
247940,163238,2006-04-07,5,"Oh, I love this recipe! My MIL taught me how to make it like this many years ago and it's scrumptious! *hint* This also works just as well with bulk sausage instead of dried beef."
9717,163238,2006-10-09,5,"I chose this recipe for PAC and my whole family loved it.  Thanks for posting a great ""comfort food"" recipe.  I will try it, as another reviewer suggested, next time with sausage.  Thanks again."
210188,163238,2007-01-16,5,"This is how I make mine. My father picked up this recipe, supposedly, while he was in the army (WWII). He taught my mother how to make it and I learned by watching. However, I use differentamounts and I make hardboiled eggs and slice them onto the toast before putting the chipped beef over it. Thanks for the suggestion of putting it over home fries.  I never thought of that!
Lee"
343262,163238,2008-01-17,5,"Great recipe ! One can also use part evaporated milk , it's creamy and isn't as expensive as cream. This is great made with ground beef that has been browned and drained. Add lots of black pepper and serve on toast or mashed potatoes. Either meat you use will make a warm filling meal. I've seen recipes that call for 1 cup shredded cheese to be melted into the white sauce."
56003,163238,2008-05-20,4,"This was really good, and brought back childhood memories.  My mother used to make this frequently as we were growing up.  Thnx for posting, Sherie17.  We will have this again."
369715,163238,2008-06-21,5,This was just as I remember. My mom use to make this all the time. We love chipped beef on toast but I have been buying the stouffers kind. Hubby said he was hungry for it and I had some chipped beef in the fridge and thought it couldn't be that hard to make. So I looked for a recipe and found this one. This was very easy to make and was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly but added more milk at the end as it was a bit too thick for us. Will be using this recipe again- no more store bought for us!
1136209,163238,2010-02-15,5,This is how we make it also. The dried beef was always expensive so my mother would use good lebanon bologna and now that is what my kids prefer
952152,163238,2010-03-10,5,"Yes, this is true Pennsylvania Dutch Dried Beef!  Most people don't bother to brown the meat, or ""frizzle"" it as my dutch relatives say.  This really adds to the flavor.  Great recipe."
990914,163238,2012-05-25,5,While visiting my daughter in S. Pa. and saw delicious dried beef at a local market and purchased it to make some creamed chipped beef. My Dad was a cook in Korea and made this for us as children and I loved it. In my area all you can find is that awful jarred so called dried beef meat. I made your recipe and it was delicious. Thanks for bringing a fond childhood memory back to life.
1846441,163238,2012-12-02,5,"This is a great recipe.....a flavor I've tried many times to replicate and your technique did it.  I made a couple of changes.  For health reasons, I cut the butter and flour in half.   I sliced a bunch of green onions and sauteed them in the butter before adding the dried beef.  Then I split  the liquid equally between milk and creme fraiche. The creme fraiche has some nice qualities in this situation.  It is very tolerant to cooking temperatures and rich and creamy.  I also added a few tablespoons of white wine and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  It is magnificent.  I would say without hesitation that it is the basic recipe that makes this so successful.  Thank you."
2664120,163238,2013-02-07,5,"If you want the absolute best chipped beef for this purpose, I most highly recommend ordering it from S. Clyde Weaver online (a family-owned Lancaster county company, from which this recipe derives); their's is incomparable--being from Lancaster, I've tried from many purveyors."
653438,252484,2010-04-01,4,Made this for the grandkids and they really enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half but kept the sugar the same because the apples we had weren't real sweet.  Made for SPRING PAC 2010.  Thank you!
25792,50432,2003-03-31,5,"Bev, good (and fattening), had this for Sunday morning breakfast, cut nice squares but very rich.  I did throw in some ham chunks.  Delish and I froze it in squares to reheat for a quick breakfast for me at work...let ya know how that works out....TY for a great easy recipe!"
35848,50432,2003-04-04,5,"Really easy and really delicious.  Very rich, but no one complained!  I also froze some leftovers - it makes alot.  I didn't change anything. Thanks Bev for a great brunch recipe!"
28201,50432,2006-07-04,5,"Bev, I have to admit, when I read the ingredients I first thought ""heart attack on a plate!""  It is rich, but for a special occasion, it's so worth it!  I had a few people over on Sunday for a brunch, and made this along with another breakfast strata dish I usually serve.  This one was the preferred choice judging by the empty dish I was left with.  I upped the cheese to 16 ounces, and added some crumbled cooked bacon.  I'm thinking the next time I make this I may add a bit of chopped spinach.  Thanks Bev for making my first brunch in my new apartment a big success!"
133174,50432,2006-07-30,5,"I lightened this up considerably by using a lite cheese, non-fat milk fortified with dry milk powder in place of the heavy cream and egg substitute for the eggs.  It was delicious and we enjoyed it served with fresh melon."
199848,50432,2006-07-30,5,"Very rich and delicious.  The kind of breakfast/brunch that you eat slowly to savor each bite.  I halved the recipe (using an 8"" x 8"" square pan), but didn't halve the cheese;).  Deeeeelicious!  We all loved it and we'll have this again.  Thanx for sharing this."
141293,50432,2008-06-08,5,"This is a quick easy way to make omelets for 8.  I actually cut the recipe in half and made 2 breakfasts for DH and me.  The first one we ate as is with steak and potatoes.  The second time, I placed the egg square on an onion roll with avocado, tomato and mayo.  Delicious both ways - but the sandwich was really good the next day!"
258528,50432,2008-12-12,5,Awesome!! Made this for 40 people at our church hospitality breakfast. Everyone raved about this omelet. Try it..you'll like it!
166642,50432,2009-02-09,5,This is wonderful! I love the swiss cheese in this. I didn't change a thing and it came out perfectly! My family loved it.
1701315,50432,2011-07-27,5,"This is too easy to be so amazingly good... Though, I guess with heavy cream, cheese, and butter it would be hard to go wrong ;)  I used cheddar in place of the swiss because it's what I had and halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan.  I also added a bit of ground thyme with the pepper on top.  This is an absolute keeper!"
243711,50432,2011-09-17,5,"I absolutely love the simplicity of this.  I only had Irish white cheddar, but it's hard to imagine that Swiss would have been any better.  Everyone loved it...there was one little piece left over that I had for lunch the next day.  Delicious!"
440324,50432,2012-06-16,5,"Eggcelent dish! I used Pam instead of butter, sprinkled some turkey bacon on top and it turned out great. Thank you"
128473,50432,2013-11-11,5,"A lovely recipe Bev, which I scaled down for one.  The omelet was wonderful, quick, easy to make and it tasted great.  Made as written but baked in a medium size tart pan. The rich and delicious omelet made a great lunch.  Thank you so much for sharing."
30716,31616,2003-05-08,4,"This is a great veggie dish. I precooked the potato as suggested and also some pumpkin which I added. The only thing I would change is the flavouring as the onion was a bit strong for my taste, but this method of doing vegetables is great."
83455,31616,2003-07-05,5,I loved it!  My mom loved it too. I made this for a family BBQ on the fourth.  It was yummy :)
21950,31616,2003-11-28,5,"Delicious! This was quick, easy and yummy. Can't get much better then that. Defiantly planning to make again."
195423,31616,2005-05-29,5,"i love roasted veggies. the onion soup mix was a great addition. it wasn't too strong of an onion flavor which i thought it might be. i used cooking spray, cauliflower, zucchini and yellow squash, and carrots. i will make this again. thanks for posting."
82040,31616,2006-02-21,5,"This recipe is great!  I just found it a couple of weeks ago and have already made it three times.  I thought the onion soup mix was a little strong, so the next two times I cooked it, I use a sprinkle of salt & pepper and a liberal amount of Mrs. Dash Original Blend.  When done I put in a bowl and mixed in a little butter.  It was SO GOOD!"
11297,31616,2006-02-22,5,"I added in some mushrooms and gren peppers as I didn't have any zucchini, both worked well.  I put all ingredients into a plastic bag and added a little oil, tossed them around and turned them out onto a baking paper lined shallow baking pan.  Will certainly make this again....thanks for a 'keeper' :)"
165308,31616,2006-05-02,5,Very Good. Made as directed & everything turned out just right.
307059,31616,2006-12-24,4,My family enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactally. Thanks for sharing.
348596,31616,2009-06-11,0,"I adjusted this recipe so that I could cook it at the same time and temperature as the Asian Pork Tenderloin I prepared (http://www.recipezaar.com/Asian-Pork-Tenderloin-54114). I put the veggies in a covered roasting pan and added 1/4 C. water to the soup mix, tossed the veggies around in it. I also sprayed the top of the veggies with Pam to make sure they wouldn't burn. The veggies were baked at 450 for 25 mins, and were stirred and sprayed once more during baking."
1542124,31616,2010-02-04,5,"simple & delicious. I added red potatoes, green beans, summer squash, & cauliflower. very very good!"
128473,447745,2011-10-30,5,"This is an excellent recipe Kim.  We enjoyed these tasty apple filled crepes very much.  I used spy apples and ground the spices fresh for a lovely mellow flavor.  The crepes were tender, fluffy and oh so flavorful.  I garnished this treat with a little icing sugar. I can't wait to try these with fresh churned vanilla bean ice cream. Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that got my picky dh smiling.  Made for Fall Pac - 2011."
1803568365,447745,2014-12-27,5,"This recipes was very successful. I made it for my wife and with the combination of Brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter with the apples brought a great flavor. Thank you for the recipe."
527607,276109,2008-01-10,5,"Loved these potatoes, they were excellent."
894403,276109,2008-11-28,5,Yummy! Added shredded cheeseto the top. It was very good.
303700,276109,2009-01-12,5,"Made for 123 tag.
Definitely comfort food...ohh yum!
I used onion powder and garlic powder...came out super!"
601528,276109,2009-01-25,3,These were good potatoes though I felt they were a bit bland.  I used both the onion and garlic powder but chose not to sprinkle with cheese.  The texture was very nice though.  I also wasn't sure that baking the potatoes in the oven was necessary.  I think if I made these again I would just throw them back on the stove to heat through.
844389,377858,2009-11-10,3,"It was a good recipe for sugar cookies but I and my family thought the cookies did not taste like maple. Next time I would add some pure maple extract. Also, I agree that you only need to make half the glaze."
13483,124641,2005-10-06,5,This is just so simple and easy.  I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in an 8 x 8 pan.  I also added some salsa before popping it in the oven.  With a baked potato and a veggie it was dinner!!  Thanks Geema
37449,62078,2003-06-01,5,"Oh Mirj! I really didn't expect these to be so good!I wondered if I should cook the zucchini first, so I did broil them for about 5 mins. before I added the cheese mixture. They were a little dry, but when I added  the cheese mix and broiled them for about 5 mins. they came out so yummy! Thanks for a quick and delicious recipe!!!"
37106,62078,2003-07-12,5,Pretty yummy indeed. I love that there are so many creative dishes to the low carb diet. We love zucchini and all of the other ingredients are readily available in our home at all times. We like our zucchini with a little bit of a crunch so this was perfect. Added a dash of red pepper flakes and we were in heaven. Thanks Mirj!
20114,62078,2003-08-05,5,"This is a new regular at my house. I broiled them for about 5 minutes about 6-7 inches away from the broiler and they turned out great. Just the right amount of crunch and delicious too! I can't wait to serve them to guests.
Thanks Mirj!"
62043,62078,2003-09-12,5,"These were very good Mirj! I made them for my low carb breakfast. I might take another reviewers suggestion and slightly cook the zucchini first next time. Thanks for another great low carb alternative!

119445,62078,2004-01-02,4,"Nice change from too soft squash. I actually threw these together from with 10 or 12 excitedly chatting people ""helping me in the kitchen"". I agree that they should be precooked a tad. I also left them in the oven a liitle too long when melting the cheese so that a lot of it ran out. Think I'll scoop out a canoe shape cutting off the ends after. It's a keeper!!
"
35635,30118,2002-06-10,5,"These are so tasty and they make the kitchen smell sooo good.

I like to make these wedge shaped instead of cubes, and I add some garlic powder too.

A little bit of sour cream for dipping, heaven..."
47767,30118,2002-07-07,5,"Great! I added a pinch of garlic powder to the cheese mixture in a sandwich bag & shook to mix.  Poured the oil in a 9 x 9 square baking dish.  Paper toweled dry the cubed potatoes, added them to the oil and tossed to coat.  Then sprinkled on half the cheese, stirred and sprinkled the other half.  Baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes then turned on broiler to lightly brown the potatoes.  No left-overs tonight!"
16758,30118,2002-07-14,3,"I thought it was alright,but like everyone said i should have added garlic powder"
36944,30118,2002-09-26,5,WOW!  You've done it again Inez!  These potatoes have a fantastic flavor.  They are easy to prepare and use ingredients I normally have on hand.  Thanks for another new family favorite!!!!  
50445,30118,2003-04-22,5,"very simple to make, baked right along with the meat loaf. I also added the garlic powder, stirred the potatoes a few times during baking to get nice and crispy.  made a nice side dish. thanks!!"
64443,30118,2003-06-04,5,These were fantastic! I did have to cook them a little bit longer than suggested since I made the potato chunks bigger than suggested. Fantastic way of eating your spuds! Thanks for this recipe!
78770,30118,2003-07-06,4,Good potatoes. Easy dish. Next time I'll try stirring the potatoes during baking as another reviewer did.  DH liked these. Will make again. Tasty.
97472,30118,2003-08-04,0,"Great recipe. I did alter it a bit, used oregano instead of basil, and added garlic powder as suggested, and tossed the potatoes into the mixture. I cooked it for 45 minutes then added 1/2 Cup of grated Cheddar Cheese and about 2 tsp seaoning salt then cooked it for an additional 15 minutes. No leftovers at this house and even those who don't normally comment about a dish were quick to give glowing comments about this one."
82367,30118,2003-10-09,5,"Oh my gosh! I was browsing recipes and just happened to see this and realized that I never submitted my review!! How could I have forgotten! They have already become a keeper that I have made several times!!!! These are just great and nice for a change from the usual potato(mashed, baked etc...) They are a breeze to make and taste great for being so easy! I make them exactly as stated except I throw in some garlic powder & onion salt. I made these while we were vacationing at a cottage this summer and my sister eagerly wrote down the recipe!! I have so far made these to go with supper meals but think they would be equally as good alongside bacon & eggs in the morning, with an added bonus of being done in the oven...one less thing to cook in the frying pan!! Thanks for sharing this Mizz Nezz!"
55988,30118,2004-06-17,5,These are so good and easy to make. The only thing I did different was I substituted the veg. oil with butter. Thanks for the recipe!
122235,30118,2004-06-20,4,"I had expected these to come out more crispy.  I think perhaps my pan was too crowded.  I had large potatoes & using 4 of them yeilded a whole lot of potato cubes.  I also found the need to cook them longer than the suggested time.  But this was good & I will try it again.  I served it with Country Lady's most excellent pan roasted asparagus, Kim 127's Beer & Lime Marinated Salmon, & Just Cher's Artichoke Bread for a Father's Day feast."
68460,30118,2005-03-02,4,"These were pretty good.  I made as written and baked them in a shallow, glass baking dish.  Next time I'll use a non-stick baking dish as they stuck quite a bit to the glass.  I used yukon gold potatoes and they came out somewhat crispy on the outside and creamy within.  Thanks for posting this MizzNezz!"
411676,30118,2007-07-13,5,I have made this many times for my family and guests and it has always been a success!  Very easy to make and always smells great!
3288,30118,2009-07-22,4,"These are pretty good.  I definitely needed about 15 more minutes cooking time.  This may be due to the higher elevation?  I am more of a ""handful"" kind of cook so I didn't measure the spices but I was pretty close.  Great overall taste.  Will definitely make again!"
119956,30118,2011-01-09,5,"Like another reviewer, I subbed the oil with butter. I spread melted butter on my baking sheet, turned the potatoes a few times during cooking. I used unpeeled red potatoes, maybe five or six cups. Everyone enjoyed these potatoes; I liked that they are made with ingredients I always have on hand. I cooked them in the same oven with my chicken wings at 350 for one hour."
653438,512668,2014-05-06,5,"All I can say is that this is DELICIOUS.  DH and I love garlic but I did use little cloves (all I had) but it still had the garlicy flavor.  Definately a keeper.  Made the homemade pico de gallo and we had this served with recipe#300679#300679, recipe#344392#344392, Spanish rice and the home made salsa.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
362160,331946,2009-04-18,5,"Made for PAC Spring '09. I was being brave to try this, and was pleasantly surprised!!!  :) Thanks!"
228458,331946,2009-10-09,4,"I just love this idea! I think I may have sliced mine a bit too thin, though, as they went from baking to burnt rather quickly (though I did watch them). The ones that did not burn, hoewever, were truly yummy. I skipped the sugar since beets are already so sweet, and I use seasoned salt instead of all the spices. The vinegar is a wonderful touch! I will certainly make these again, as I am always looking for healthy snacks for my family. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Fall 2009."
369715,331946,2010-04-16,4,Wanted to try something different with beets. I followed the recipe other then I used splenda for sugar and didn't add allspice as I didn't have any. This was a tasty snack that we all enjoyed. Made for Spring PAC 2010.
111296,312656,2009-04-17,5,"Quick and easy recipe that was ery tasty and refreshing!  I used Greek style yogurt and had it for a quick breakfast!  Nice, healthy way to start the morning.  This will be delightful when fresh local berries are in season at the farm stands!  I made this for Spring PAC 2009-thanks Silvia de la Sil!"
128473,312656,2012-10-30,5,"Another terrific smoothie Silvia.  I really enjoyed the banana, mixed berries and juices in this drink.  I used a good thick Greek yogurt and fresh pineapple and orange juices, so good.  It was quick and really easy to make, a great way to start the day. A beautifully flavored, thick smoothie that is so good for you.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Fall Pac 12"
837995,105670,2008-10-24,5,Excellent choice to make for my party!
80353,12715,2003-09-12,4,"Very good recipe.  The texture is the way we like it, neither too thick and stodgy nor too runny.  I did the Greek thing in the end and sprinkled it with cinnamon rather than serve it with cream."
69838,12715,2005-07-28,4,"This was a nice recipe.  It took my rice 3hrs and 35 minutes to completely dissolve.  Mine wasnt quite as thick as Id anticipated, but it was still quite good. Since it wasnt very thick at all, i didnt serve with cream... rather just ate it with cinnamon sprinkled on the top.  Used the vanilla :) thanks for the recipe. Im sure i'll be trying this again!"
461131,199636,2007-05-08,4,Very easy to prep. My family liked it a lot.  I will be making this again.
3288,199636,2010-02-26,4,Good basic recipe that helps to seal in the moisture in the chicken.  Thank you!
383346,150534,2011-10-23,5,This is so yummy.  I used unsweetened soy milk.  Thanks PR Princess :)  Made for Bargain Basement tag game
49304,67197,2004-10-17,5,"OMG, these are delicious, better than regular Apple Sausages, DH said, these are a must to make again they are in my cookbooks, favorites. I didn't change a thing, used a large golden delicious apple.Yummy. Thank you Laurie, for another delicious recipe."
5060,67197,2006-09-24,5,"Oh my, these were very delicious!  I used turkey sausage and served it with a salad, baked potato and veggies, great supper! Very simple, easy to put together and tasts wonderful!! Great way to cook the sausages with out using fat or even veggies spray, I will definately be making these again, thanks for posting."
172755,67197,2006-10-11,5,"Dear hubby says ""awesome"".  This was so quick and easy to prepare and really was an inexpensive meal.  We had scrambled eggs and toast...we often have breakfast for supper.  I will make this often and can't wait to tell the girls at work.  I like the ""texture"" of the cooked apples and the contrast of flavor.  I made it just as the recipe stated except i added just a little more water when I added the apples altho I think I didn't need to and I won't next time.  I can't wait to make this for a company breakfast!  It says four servings...I guess hubby and I were hungry...and he just finished off the last sausage in the pan.  Thanks so much for a keeper!"
276321,67197,2006-11-01,5,excellent! great taste...during camping...thanks
22724,67197,2006-11-04,5,"Fast, easy, and delicious!  We love breakfast for dinner and we had this dish along with our favorite scrambled eggs, Miss Diggy's, Easy Eggs.  Definitely a repeater.  Quite an impressive dish as well...great dish to serve company.  Thanks for this great recipe! :)"
625105,67197,2007-12-05,5,Easy and delicious!  What a fabulous way to dress up ordinary pork sausages.  I serve them for supper with roast potatoes and vegetables in cheese sauce.  I'll be emailing this recipe to all my family and friends.
140132,67197,2008-06-29,5,Fantastic!  I made this for brunch.  What a wonderful combination.  Thank you for posting.
127181,67197,2009-01-08,5,"Being an Aussie I'd never heard of apple sausages, or cooking apples with sausages. Had this for dinner and it was great, we all loved it. Another budget pleaser."
881068,67197,2009-06-25,0,"Being another Aussie, would never have thought to put apples with snags..Love it and so does the rest of the family."
228229,67197,2009-08-02,5,"This was excellent! I'd never heard of apple flavored sausages, and I live in the U.S. Guess I'm sheltered! I'll definitely be making this again."
1445969,67197,2009-12-14,5,great recipe! I accidently used cinnamon instead of brown sugar and it was delicious!
603750,67197,2011-08-07,5,SO good!! I made these with crock pot french toast casserole. I was going to make just plain sausages but these made the PERFECT accompaniment. Fantastic flavor!
199848,298599,2009-04-07,5,"Not the same old boring eggs, that's for sure!   I used arugula; the peppery flavor was perfect with the eggs and balsamic vinegar.  This makes a very pretty presentation and is super easy to make.  A great way to eat greens and eggs.  Thanx for posting this.  I'll be making this again with any variety of greens that I may have!"
47892,298599,2011-05-26,5,"We love arugula but as luck would have it I was completely out of it to make this dish today. To the rescue: radish greens from our CSA box. Fresh local eggs, blooming chives from the garden and also added some baby spinach leaves to the mix. Made as written. Easy, and oh so tasty scooped up with whole wheat sourdough bread. Thanks!"
369972,298599,2011-07-17,5,"Terrific, savory breakfast! I made it with egg whites only and dandelion greens. The peppery greens with the sweetness of the balsamic reduction made for a beautifully balanced flavor profile. Farm-fresh white peaches sliced on the side were equally tasty with the left over reduction. Thanks for posting!"
2066263,298599,2012-02-07,4,"These were quite nice! I only had spinach, but it worked out just fine. I also added some green onion. I love the balsamic vinegar! Thanks! :D"
900992,298599,2013-01-12,3,"This was certainly interesting and different. We used beet greens and baby spinach. I didn't hate it, but I probably wouldn't make it again that way. I think it would be better with arugula and we may try that."
1085389,344793,2008-12-28,4,"I made this for my roommate's family.  I didn't have a cheese grater, so I cut the gruyere in thin slices and laid it down on the bottom of the pan.  I didn't have nutmeg and chives, so I added tomatoes, onions and spinach instead.  I also didn't have a blender, so I tried to mix the milk, eggs and sourcream as best as I could.  Overall, very tasty, kinda like a crustless quiche.  It received good reviews One thing to note, if you use veggies, layer them at the bottom of the pan because they tend to rise to the top of the dish."
1092246,309594,2009-01-11,4,Very easy to make
371672,309594,2009-01-13,5,"Excellent weeknight get-it-on-the-table-quick, oh-my-gosh-that's-good dinner (and complete in much less than the stated time - you should adjust that so you can list this as a one-dish, under 30 minute recipe).

I stirred in the thyme/oregano/garlic-powder in for a few seconds before the wet ingredients - a quick burst of dry heat brings out the flavor in dry spices.

Thanks for a great easy recipe, AllergyGirl (and 
Geshundheit)!"
465056,309594,2009-08-21,4,Very easy and quite yummy.
1084552,309594,2009-09-15,5,"Yummy, a wonderful staple at our house"
6357,95926,2004-07-20,4,"This tastes great when you substitute homemade chocolate syrup instead of mayo, IMO..Loved it! Thanks for posting!"
104621,95926,2004-07-21,5,"These are great! Ive made them  many times in the last few years, and they are just right  for a snack or lite lunch. The bananas dont have to be overly ripe to suit me. I have put a Tblsp of peanut butter on one slice of bread, and the mayo on the other.  "
26032,95926,2004-07-21,5,This is great!! My mother used to make these for me when I was younger.  I like this best with toasted bread.  Yummy!!!
33722,95926,2004-07-22,5,"I have made this since I was a kid and it is one of my favorite sandwiches.  I have heard about it with Peanut Butter, but nothing beats the mayo.  Don't knock it til you try it."
146637,95926,2004-11-02,5,My mom used to make these for me. I love them with salt and pepper. Very good.
202733,95926,2005-03-14,5,"Daddy used to make these for us when we were little, they were a BIG treat in our household.  Unfortunately, I have extremely low blood pressure and can no longer eat bananas, but oh I remember these sandwiches and how daddy would put lots of pepper on the mayo, simply delicious!!! And they don't give you that heavy feeling like peanut butter and banana sandwiches do  :)"
21841,95926,2005-04-08,5,Yum is right!  Been eating these for years.  Very fresh bread is a must.  Thanks for posting.....think I will have one for lunch today!
40560,95926,2005-04-09,5,"When I saw this recipe I couldn't believe it.  I had forgotten all about it.  it was my fav..as a a sub teen/teen/grandma.
GOOD GOING."
17803,95926,2005-04-10,5,"Being a mayo lover myself, this was just A-okay in my book!  I used one piece of white and one of wheat. Next time I make this I'll cut the mayo back to 1 1/2  teaspoon per slice of bread as my banana slices would slide around as I tried to eat the sandwich.  LOL "
125808,95926,2005-04-10,5,I grew up on these.  :-)
170959,95926,2005-04-24,0,I LOVE banana sandwiches made this way!! Never ate them any other way growing up. So glad to see that many others are now joining us in our mayo/banana lovefest!
29782,95926,2005-06-23,5,"Just came across this recipe. I also have made banana sandwiches for years. Its very easy and simple to make and taste is delicious. Some folks likes peanut butter in place of mayonnaise, I personally am a mayonnaise person. LOL  Thanks for sharing this oldie but goodie recipe! I have a banana so I think I'm off to make one right now. YUM!"
54271,95926,2005-08-07,5,I thought everyone ate these! SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! The freshest bread possible is a must. DH likes mayo on one side and peanut butter on the other. You have to try this!! 
233014,95926,2005-10-02,5,I've been eating this since my dad introduced it to me 20 years ago. The only difference is he puts some salt in his hand and rubs them together over the sandwich. The little bit of salt adds a great flavor.
169969,95926,2006-02-02,5,After seeing Marsha D's photos and smelling the Buttermilk Honey Wheat Bread I had baking in the oven (recipe #128588) I knew I had a winning match. This was the best banana sandwich I have made!
302815,95926,2006-03-18,1,"A sandwich can taste great to one person and terrible to another. The banana with mayo just does not go, it has acidity and banana is sweet. I made it,i ate it ( at least tried), I throw it. I made it again as a sweet sandwich useing thick whip cream in place of the mayo. Try both yourself! I tested both  at a party, nearly all the mayo were left, the banana cream filling were all gone. Action speaks better than words.
davepearce1575@yahoo.com"
95372,95926,2006-06-13,5,The best ever!!!!  I moved to NM frome NC and nobody here even heard of mayo and 'naner sandwich!!! (or slaw on hot dogs!!!)
428463,95926,2007-01-12,5,This is my all time #1 favorite sandwich! If I go too long without it I crave it. I remember my grandpa making these for me and my sister when we were young. I have them at work for lunch all the time and people this I'm crazy but they just need to try it themselves!
106777,95926,2007-06-23,5,Love love love this sandwich - grew up on it!!  Peanut butter is good.. but mayo?? UNBELIEVABLE!!
47510,95926,2008-01-04,5,"I grew up eating these, haven't had one in ages, but this recipe sure did bring back some good memories.  My grandmother used to make these for me and they were delicious!"
292308,95926,2008-03-03,5,"When I was growing up, my dad ate one of these every Sunday morning for breakfast before church (with a glass of Tang :)  We also like them for a light dinner.  The tang of mayo (I prefer Dukes) goes well with sweet banana (make sure they are ripe!)  I actually had one for dinner the other night (b/f stumbling across this).  Do try it.  I've also seen people mayo one slice of bread, lay banana in it like a hotdog, and eat it like that :)"
4740,95926,2008-06-05,2,I don't know about this one.  I tried it and one of my daughters tried it and thought it was just ok.  It was good but I think I'd rather eat a banana by itself.
206442,95926,2009-08-29,5,"Oh my, I grew up eating banana sandwiches and I still eat them.  White bread & Dukes Mayonnaise.  Wash it down with a cold glass of milk.  Simple and delish!"
1612977,95926,2010-05-10,4,"I grew up eating these. Nothin' gourmet but sometimes this is the only thing that'll hit the spot. Fresh, white bread and Duke's mayo are essential."
122878,95926,2010-06-15,5,"I too grew up eating these and still do.  You've got to love the simplicity.  They are so, so good but darned if I can get my kids or grandkids to try them.  Oh well, more for me."
139381,95926,2010-06-16,5,"I too grew up eating these.  We did do them with just a light sprinkling of sugar.  Ahhh!  Nostagia!  I haven't eaten one in years, but I have bananas on hand and tomorrow just might be the right day!  Thanks for a lovely reminder!"
605574,95926,2010-07-31,0,"My family has eaten these all our lives, though a lot of people thought we were strange.  It makes a fabulous breakfast, snack or lunch.  They're great with wheat bread too!"
286566,95926,2010-08-31,5,"I made this for the DM and she loved the twist of having the mayo on the sandwich, I would have used about 2 teaspoons and 1 large banana and 2 slices of wholemeal/wholegrain bread. Thoroughly enjoyed, thank you MizEmerill, made for Potluck Tag."
844554,95926,2010-09-16,5,"Talk about bringing back childhood memories!!! When I found this recipe, I just had to make one of these again. I had forgotten how tasty they were. I thought we were the only ones to eat this but I can see I was mistaken. Thanks for memory lane."
475484,95926,2011-02-17,1,"Im sorry but you must have to grow up eating this to like it, It was like savoury and sweet that wernt meant to be"
526666,95926,2011-05-06,5,"This is such a treasured childhood memory...I love banana sandwiches and still indulge, occasionally! The bread must be fresh, and 'my' mayo must be Kraft! I sure appreciate your sharing this recipe, MizEmerilLagasse!"
2208765,95926,2012-03-11,5,"My dad use to make me these as a kid.  One of my favorites.  People think I'm crazy because I love these sandwiches, but they just don't know how good they are!  I also like to put chips on this sandwich too.  I like the crunch against the texture of the soft bread and bananas."
2210747,95926,2012-03-14,5,I love banana and mayo sandwiches! I grew up on them. Don't know where everyone is from but it must be a southern thang! Adding a sprinkle of sugar is also very good. I do know some people that like them with marshmallow fluff instead of mayo.
2401954,95926,2012-09-14,5,"This is a sandwich that requires no recipe: start with 2 slices of fresh, soft bread (white or wheat); slather on as much mayonnaise as you like on both slices of bread (I like the sandwich to be rather moist so I use a lot); put as many banana slices as you can across one slice of bread (I prefer to cut mine in lengthwise halves); and then cap the sandwich off with the second slice of bread (pressing slightly to create a nice seal).  Like others have said, this is a sandwich that reminds me of my childhood - I'd eat 2 of them most afternoons when I arrived home from school.  And most definitely, this sandwich is a Southern specialty.  Edited to add star rating."
2879123,95926,2013-06-26,5,They sound gross but........They are AWESOME
1803611854,95926,2015-01-04,0,"This is very close to a recipe that I have used for years, but let me tell you how to make it better:&lt;br/&gt;Add 1 Tbs of white sugar to recipe, but mash everything together in a bowl or food processor, spread on bread and enjoy."
2000355338,95926,2015-07-22,5,"Sounded odd when I heard the recipe (sorry for being French :) ), but it actually tastes very good, perfect balance between sweetness of banana and bread against the acidity of mayo. Sometimes it does not have to be more complicated than that !!"
2000533197,95926,2015-10-07,5,"I grew up eating this, but I&#039;ve had friends try it and love it.  Though they thought they wouldn&#039;t.  You have to use dukes mayo to make this work, though."
2000912079,95926,2016-03-09,5,"I don&#039;t like mayonnaise but tryed it without and it worked - was unsure if it really would but it did.
Looking into crisp sandwiches next wonder if ready salted is they right thing?"
2834180,95926,2017-01-30,5,"I love this recipe! I'm a 60s baby and I've been eating these all my life. Maybe it's justa Southern thing? Who knows? But, alas, I think these are awesome!"
2001569573,95926,2017-06-05,0,"Do NOT use overly ripe bananas. The bananas should be yellow and ready to eat, but not very ripe."
2000188242,95926,2017-12-23,5,"Guess it's a Southern &quot;thang&quot;, because I've been eating banana sandwiches my entire life! Sooooo good!! I slice my bananas long ways, use ONLY Dukes Mayonnaise and 2 slices of soft, white sandwich bread, THAT'S IT, NOTHING ELSE NEEDED!! So simple, yet so delicious!! Thank you, Mr. Lagasse, for posting an actual recipe and bringing attention to this old Southern delicacy. I was JUST now eating one and decided to Google it to see if it was just something my mother fed us as children alone or if it was an actual &quot;thang&quot;!! lol I'm so pleased to see so many other people enjoy these delicious sandwiches!! Mmmmm, think I'll have another!!"
2002174000,95926,2018-06-03,1,totally agree mayo and banana doesnt work
24855,60788,2003-04-26,4,"I loved this recipe. I also used oka and swiss cheeses, worked great. Sharron cant in the kitchen"
13933,60788,2003-10-20,5,"Made this for a friend's baby's baptism. Had 25 people to feed and this was a relatively simple preparation. I did steam the asparagus for about 5-6 minutes, before I put it on the broiler rack. Not a stalk left over! Everyone raved! Thanks, Norma!"
50551,60788,2005-01-14,5,"This was a welcome and wonderful idea to do something new with the asparagus instead of steaming it.
The kids liked it too! simple to do and nice flavor mixtures."
262423,60788,2006-03-20,5,Everyone thought it was great! Made this for St. Patrick's day and the asparagus went well with the corned beef & potatoes. Will definately be making it again!  Thank you for providing me with my new favorite way to make asparagus!
128950,60788,2007-04-09,4,"I thought this was good, but others couldn't stop raving about it.  I made it for Easter dinner yesterday at my in-laws and there were 42 people there (so I scaled the recipe to 10 lbs.)  It was great to prep in advance, but the parmesan butter was more like a sauce than a coating which I had thought.  I gave 4 stars because of the raves I got."
26278,53324,2003-05-01,5,"Hot pepper, horseradish!!! Wow! Does this recipe pop! I really liked it a lot.  These were a great hit at our supper table!! Thanks for posting.
"
647666,302737,2008-05-13,5,"My kids got up early and made this for me for mother's day.  It was so yummy!  I loved it.  I made it the next day and made up a half recipe, mixing the sugar and mustard together and thinning it down a bit.  That way I basted the coating on one side of some partially cooked bacon before baking.  Turned out awesome.  Thanks for the idea!"
273647,302737,2011-06-18,0,I find this works great with any of your favorite bbq sauces and change it up depending on the application. I particularly like the dijon when I'm using it for Mac n Cheese.
558429,479742,2012-05-30,5,"I was desperate to use up a wilting head of celery and I'm glad I stumbled upon this recipe! Since hubby and I are on a low-fat diet, I decided to cut way back on the butter and I also omitted the salt as I thought the chicken broth was salty enough. A generous spoonful of Mrs. Dash rounded things out with the herbs and we thoroughly enjoyed the end result! From now on I'll be going out of my way to buy celery as I'll be adding this side dish to my permanent collection. Thanks for posting, lazyme! :)"
865936,485363,2012-10-23,4,"I really enjoyed the flavor of this burger, even though I did use ground turkey.  Ground turkey is a bit softer and therefore harder to work with, but I sort of built and formed the burger in the pan while it cooked!  Of course, to make this you need a basic knowledge of how to make a compound butter since the instructions and/or recipe are not included.  I just made it up to taste."
953275,328254,2010-07-22,5,"My children love these, and they're treats you can feel good about.  I had to add a touch of juice to the blender just to get things going.  Great fruit combo!"
197023,119890,2005-11-14,5,"I made these recently when I needed a substitute for spring roll wrappers when making sarahsmomi's Crispy Prawn Baskets Recipe #134709.  I’ve made bread cups like this before, but couldn’t remember what temperature to cook them at or for how long.  Mercy’s instructions were very clear, and admirably met the need of the moment.  Only later did I remember that I’d posted a recipe for filled bread cups made in muffin pans: Goat's Cheese, Avocado & Smoked Salmon Cups Recipe #140896.  LOL!  Just knew I’d made them frequently in the past with a range of fillings: whatever was on hand and whatever suited the whim of the moment!  A quick and healthier option than using pastry cases.  On this occasion, I made these using a wholegrain bread, and rolled my bread slices flat with a rolling pin before cutting them into rounds, because that’s what I remembered having done in the past!  And it makes them easier to mould into the muffin pan recesses."
464972,119890,2007-04-28,4,"Very cute, simple, and yummy!!! The only changes i made was i used whole wheat bread and regular butter, so i didnt salt them. Ive used this multiple times, and will definatly keep using them. Thanks for the cute recipe!"
865285,303987,2008-06-18,0,I tried this recipe and it was great the bacon and onions really enhance the asparagus and it was simple to make. I will definetly make this again
111342,166476,2006-06-21,5,"SUPER good!  Very easy and incredibly fast.  I added sliced avocado and green onions and what was supposed to be the side dish, turned into the highlight of my meal!  Will be making this again, thanks for posting!"
199848,166476,2007-04-25,4,"A very good, colorful, versatile salad.  I used medium salsa and low-fat ranch dressing.  I thought it needed onions, so I added some.  If I had fresh tomatoes (especially homegrowns) I think I'd use them in place of the salsa.  Thanx for a nice salad lunch.  I'll whip this again when I'm in the mood for a quick satisfying salad!"
374520,166476,2007-07-19,5,This is a perfect summer dish!  I leave out the ranch dressing because none of here like it and I cook some ground Bison with taco seasoning.  Even the kids love this salad!  Thanks for sharing.
1129191,166476,2010-07-23,5,"I needed a salad without mayonnaise, and this really was good. I used kidney beans with taco seasoning and fresh salsa (because I ran out of bottled), and everyone really enjoyed it. This is definitely a recipe keeper for hot summer days and BBQs!"
65379,73022,2003-12-15,5,"I wish I could give this 6 stars.  I injected my thanksgiving turkey with this (deep fried, of course) on Thursday.  The family loved it!  On Sunday, I injected a venison roast for the crock pot with the remaining.  It's a good thing I was sitting when I took that first bite or I would have fallen down.  I am worried that I'll start messing with the recipie because it's so simple."
61660,73022,2007-03-07,5,I only did about 3 venison steaks so I quartered the recipe and it worked out so well.  I marinated them for about 5 hours.  DH loved the flavor!  He ate 2 of the steaks and was eyeing mine (but I didn't share).  I just pan fried but that worked ok.  Thanks eBeth!!
424680,73022,2007-05-01,5,"Made for PAC, Spring 2007 ~ And here I thought I had enough great recipes for seasoning my pork roasts ~ boy, was I wrong!! This very simple marinade makes for really, really great-tasting pork! I can hardly wait to use it on poultry! Thanks for the recipe!"
468146,73022,2007-07-05,5,eBeth what flavor filled marinade! It was so easy to pull together with ingredients I always have on hand. I followed the recipe exactly only adding more garlic. I let my steaks marinade for 6 hours and then grilled them. DH and DS loved them. This has become one of my favorites!
834555,73022,2010-01-21,5,"Easy, Simple and down right delicious!  Look no further, use this marinade and you will not regret it. Easy accessible ingredients, every home usually has these in the kitchen."
415368,115383,2007-04-07,5,"Yummy, easy, and my family loved it! My husband took leftovers to work, and his co-workers asked for the recipe.  Wouldn't change a thing, Thanks for a great recipe!"
765539,115383,2009-02-03,5,"Easy to make, and rated highly by my 5- and 9-year-olds (especially when called ""pizza crepes"").  I didn't have the farmer's cheese, so I used just the buffalo mozzarella.  I think I would have preferred a little more taste to the filling (garlic? pepper?), but the fresh basil is fantastic and I don't feel I can take away a star since I didn't stick to the recipe and will be making it again."
275072,49308,2005-12-19,5,"This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  If you haven't tried it yet, you should!  You're missing out on a delectable feast.  Great idea for a Sunday dinner."
482376,382841,2011-08-13,4,"I absolutely loved the flavor combination of avocado, basil, garlic and lime juice! I used this as a salad dressing, but I think it would be great on pasta because it is nice and thick. I tried to thin the dressing out by adding more lime juice and some water. I didn't want to add too much water, though, and lose that wonderful flavor combination! Thank you for a very healthy and tasty dressing recipe. :)"
267853,263698,2007-12-01,3,"These were OK.  They didn't stay together for me.  The flavor was good but when they came out of the pan they fell apart.  Maybe if the apples were cooked with more sugar first?  I think it's a great start to a recipe, just needs something..."
333017,481529,2013-03-24,3,"I was a bit on the fence with this one.  I cut the recipe in half as I was serving 2 steaks...but I kept the garlic to 2 cloves and omitted the parsley as I didn&#039;t have it.  After tasting it, I added a good dollop of Dijon mustard, a couple shakes of hot sauce and about 1 T of Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Yum!!"
317596,154808,2006-12-28,5,"These shortbread cookies were sooo good. I halved the recipe. The only change I made was I added a bit of water to my dough because it just wasn't coming together. I also chilled my dough twice, after rolling and then after cutting. These came out perfect."
465056,184347,2007-09-21,4,This was a very good cheesecake but we didnt care for the crust.  I used an orange marmalade glaze on it.
76299,52678,2003-03-12,5,"This was wonderful! It was quick and easy, and everyone loved it. I prepared it according to directions, except that I microwaved it for 13 minutes instead of baking it because, as usual, I was running short of time. The surprise was that it developed a lovely golden crust in the microwave."
23581,52678,2003-03-28,5,"This is delicious. I find that it is a dip that men seem to especially like. When I fix this, I am always asked to share the recipe."
29014,52678,2004-01-18,5,"Excellent - I could have eaten the whole dish myself!  I followed the recipe exactly as posted and wouldn't change anything.  The sweet onions ""make"" this dip."
97579,52678,2005-04-04,5,"This was excellent!!!  Very tasty, especially spread over warm bread.  Will definately be making it again!!!  Thanks for a great recipe."
178504,52678,2005-04-07,5,"This got devoured - everyone loved it, even those who claim not to like swiss cheese.  I had a tiny bit left - it reheated in the microwave the next day.

I made this exactly as written - it was terrific - thanks !"
247395,52678,2006-05-11,5,Can't get any easier than this.  Everyone and I mean everyone who tried it raved about it.  Can't wait to make it again.  Only problem is that I was wishing there was some leftover the next day.  Not a chance.  Try it.  It's great!  Thanks for the recipe!
365277,52678,2007-11-26,5,"Very filling but really yummy.  The swiss cheese balances the sweetness of the onion very well. 
thanks for a great recipe!"
174096,52678,2008-06-13,5,Fabulous and so easy!  I had a really nice Vidalia onion and this was a great recipe to showcase it in.  Thanks for a keeper!
89831,329008,2009-01-19,5,"quick easy and delicious, I also added in 1 clove minced garlic and some cayenne, love this, thanks for sharing Acadia!"
383346,329008,2012-10-10,5,I always have ranch dressing.  And this is a great sauce to do at the last minute.  My son likes his fish with a sauce and he liked that one.  I used dried dill cause I didn't have fresh.  Thanks Acadia :)  Made for Photo tag game
780172,306334,2009-12-18,5,"These were very good and a nice way to make potatoes. I did change a couple of things, we had no red potatoes, so used white potatoes and I did peel them and I did cut back on the garlic some. Also, your recipe calls for onion but there is no onion in the ingredient list, but I did add onion. Thanks"
350938,408620,2010-05-31,5,This reminds me of garlic mayo but thinner. I used it to drizzle in my roast beef sub. Nice and garlicky.
1155210,408620,2010-08-19,5,"A fun and tasty recipe! I just love the garlic and lemon combination, you could put this on practically anything. Thanks!"
47559,120791,2005-08-07,5,"When DH realized we didn't have enough charcoal,and didn't feel like going to the store, I found this little jewel.  It was very tender and juicy, but had a crispy BBQ flavored skin.  I think that baking it at the higher temperature in the beginning was the secret.  I will use the release foil next time, as some of the skin stuck to the pan.  Delicious.  The only thing missing was the smoke flavor.  Thanks for sharing this easy recipe."
312363,120791,2010-07-12,5,"Your recipe saved the day! I was about to barbecue some chicken drumsticks when I realized my gas grill was out of gas!  So, I went to my trusty ol' Zaar site and found your recipe.   I had already par-boiled my chicken so I only had to cook the chicken for a total of 1/2 hour.  Everyone loved the chicken!  Thank you for sharing what I call ""Save the day barbecued chicken!"""
1535,102185,2005-11-07,4,"The kids asked me to give this 5,000 stars for taste. LOL! It does have a wonderful flavor (a bit sweet, which is probably why they liked it so much) but I feel the recipe needs some flour or  cornstarch in it to thicken the sauce. I couldn't find the white corn for some reason but the yellow worked fine. "
479329,102185,2007-04-07,5,Me and a friend made this for a party and it was wonderful but if you  think it is to runny add a little flour
401886,102185,2008-07-09,0,I have made this recipe a couple times for dinner and it's way better than can corn. I didn't have the white corn so I used the yellow corn.
690623,102185,2010-07-25,5,I am freezing this for use over the winter for the second time in 2 weeks.  Its a wonderful recipe - so much better than the canned stuff!!  I do reduce the sugar by about a third though.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for posting.
502418,193720,2007-12-22,5,This is sooo good.  I made it when I had my parents for dinner and they are just plain meat and potato kind of people and they both loved it.  Will make this again and again and again!!!
1603535,37010,2010-04-24,5,this was very easy to make and tastes fantastic!!
184986,15849,2005-02-20,4,Very good.  I made a layer cake and iced it with an almond icing.
1193707,15849,2009-04-09,5,I used to make this (I got it from a magazine) with banana baby food and this recipe is delicious.  I make it in a bread pan and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar when cold.
483948,15849,2009-07-27,3,I made this cake when my husband and I told our parents that we were having a boy (I frosted it with blue icing.)
356592,187508,2006-09-27,5,I love the twist with peas!!!!
366672,187508,2007-01-02,5,"I made this tonight for some comfort food, but, after cooking the sausages (english pork bangers) I cooked the onions rings in the juice of the sausage and made a gravy from the ""pan"" - was yummy.. thanks for sharing this recipe - I also threw in a few mushrooms !"
269521,187508,2007-06-04,5,"This is one of my husbands favorite dinners . . . served last night to guest, Pub Style (at the bar).   Everyone gave it 5 stars!

Thanks for sharing"
9869,187508,2007-12-12,5,"Delicious bangers and mash, I made up a sachet of beef instant gravy and added to the sausages befor serving. Very tasty."
295704,187508,2008-04-24,5,"This is a great dish. I didn't add the oil. Just used the fat from the sausage, then added mushrooms. Mushrooms act as small sponges, so they soaked up what little oil was left. Pick them out if your on a diet, like my DH. Awesome recipe Perfect, Thanks!"
185926,187508,2008-08-06,5,"I followed this recipe with the exception of the peas.  My son does not like peas so I used 2 fresh zuchinis and saute them with the onions.  My whole family loved this dish.  I tried to save the drippings from the sausage to cook the vegys but I did not get any.  The sausages were difficult to cook thorough on the skillet, so after browning the outside, I sliced them up about .5 - 1 inch thick and saute them.  Thank you for a wonderful dish.  This will definitely be part of our regular dinner line-up."
504753,187508,2009-04-27,5,"Thank you for this recipe, I think I have been waiting for it all of my life.  Bacon and sausage are the only forms of pork I will eat, and I've wanted a good Bangers and Mash recipe for almost forever.  I also love Toad in the Hole.  Thanks again.........bb"
37449,105454,2005-11-06,5,So easy and  makes a great snack!
124249,105454,2006-07-20,5,"I haven't had this in years. My Mom served this with her vegetable soup. The only thing we did different was to use cheddar instead of American cheese. Both are good. 

Thanks roseplummer.

Bullwinkle."
353685,105454,2009-06-10,5,"I make this all the time when i'm on a diet but i don't use crackers, just the apples and low fat cheese, it's so yummy and so filling, works so good for my diet"
844554,105454,2009-10-25,5,I just made this this weekend to snack on. We're low carbing right now so we just used apples and pepper jack cheese and horseradish cheddar. Yummy!!
674022,105454,2012-02-16,5,My first review got lost somehow. This was a great simple snack a lot like my apple and cheese and cinnamon snack. It is healthy and fast. Used cheddar cheese and ?Macintosh apples I sliced.Made for the Love Train in the contest and events forum. Thanks for posting. Enjoy! ChefDLH
14410,199636,2007-01-08,5,"Delicious. I used skinless drumsticks, and baked for about an hour.I was amazed at how moist the meat was...and it really was fall-off-the-bone tender. The leftovers reheated very well in the microwave next day."
246936,199636,2007-01-25,5,OMG!!!! How much easier could these be???? So flavorful and did I say easy!!!! lol Will make again and again! Thanks so much. And the chicken was tender and juciey as well!
354465,199636,2007-01-25,4,I was really not sure what to expect from this recipe but I was pleasantly surprised by how these turned out. I doubled all of the ingredients and added 1 tbsp. of Hoison sauce. I mixed it in a bowl with the soy sauce and then spooned it over the chicken before baking. I'd definately make this again. It was so easy. Next time I'll add a little oyster sauce to the mix and see how that turns out. Mmmm. Thank's for sharing!
188440,199636,2007-02-05,3,This was very good.  Thank you for posting.
321820,199636,2007-05-12,5,"This is one of those recipes that just surprises you! I wanted something very very easy and had leg quarters so that was my search, this is what came up and it can't be more easy, I figured if anything it wouldn't be bad and I could just make some rice with it, well it was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever made! I poked the pieces with a skewer and the soy got down into the chicken and flavored it nicely, the skin was beautifuly crisp and had a really nice taste, it was perfect with steamed rice and broccoli spears. Sometimes easy is best."
92195,199636,2007-06-12,4,so easy to make. Exactly what I was looking for. The soy sauce took the guess work out of the seasoning as I never seem to get the saltiness right@@
203111,199636,2007-07-20,5,"Just finished having this for supper and enjoyed it so much!  Fixed only a thigh & a leg and had to bake them about 70 min. but the wait was well worth it.  Loved the skin!!!! Enjoyed it with roasted potatoes and raw tomato slices.  Thanks, 3KillerBs!"
128693,199636,2007-07-23,5,"I made these the other night and they were really good. I didn't measure the soy sauce, just kinda poured it over the top. Then I sprinkled garlic powder on the chicken ( a combo of legs and thighs), and then, since we LOVE garlic, sprinkled on 2 cloves of minced garlic. I put the pan on a cookie sheet, then baked these on my grill. So yummy, and no heating up the kitchen. My DD even requested these for her birthday dinner next month! Thanks!"
38574,199636,2007-08-01,5,"I cannot think of a more perfect recipe.  Inexpensive, easy, kid-friendly, and super-yummy!  Thank you for my new favorite chicken recipe!"
570267,199636,2007-09-09,5,Love it! Great taste!
155866,199636,2007-09-27,5,"This was great, easy and my family snarfed it down.  Highly recommend.  I use both legs and thighs, both tasted great."
198757,199636,2007-12-01,5,"This is excellent and easy!  I used boneless skinless thighs, putting about 12 in a 9x12 pan.  I put olive oil, soy sauce and garlic powder on top.  Baked for 45 min, and then broiled for around 5 min.  Last time I used thighs with skin, and it seemed kind of greasy, so skinless is better in my opinion!"
411275,199636,2007-12-03,4,This was great! I thought it was so simple it wouldnt be that great but it turned out delicious. I used minced garlic instead of powder and just sprinkled the soy on all of it. I ended up cooking for longer than suggested and actually turned the oven up to 400 dgs during the last 30 mins but it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe.
448204,199636,2007-12-07,5,"I have made this many times now and I can't believe I forgot to review it.  I love this because it is so simple and I always have the ingredients.  A couple times I put all ingred. in a ziploc, placed in fridge until ready to cook.  We love the taste of this chicken, I'm even making it tonight again.  Thanks for sharing with us all."
415907,199636,2007-12-16,5,"We just had an ice storm and lost all our food. I managed to buy some chicken thighs and had very little else. This recipe called for so little ingredients and everything I had on hand.
It was WONDERFUL! We will make this again with out a doubt."
329183,199636,2008-01-09,3,"I thought this chicken was good but not great. Even with the spices it was a lot blander than I'd expect, and it was also pretty oily.  I had to drain it on paper towels after  cooking.  The *best* thing about it is that it's so easy, and for that it gets 3 stars.  I think I'll try some variations on the spices, and maybe take the skin off partway thru.  I used the convection setting on my oven it and it still took longer than 60 minutes."
43083,199636,2008-02-20,3,Man I really wanted to love this! SO simple yet...maybe I did something wrong?? I splashed each thigh with soy sauce and sprinkled with garlic powder and it just wasnt that tasty. Maybe I should of cut into the thighs? Sorry to give such a low rating but just wanted to be honest...
807999,199636,2008-04-02,5,This was excellent and soooo simple!  My husband loved them so much he bought me a Kate Spade bag!!  Now THATS a recipe!
543983,199636,2008-05-05,0,Loved this one!  I actually marinate my chicken thighs in a ziploc bag with the garlic powder & soysauce.  I poked holes in the thighs and didn't really measure the garlic powder or soy.  I just put enough to coat.   I have also put any extra thighs in the freezer with the marinade for a later meal and they turn out great too!  Thanks for posting.
605921,199636,2008-05-10,5,Super simple! Easier than PBJ! Really does have the chinese food taste. DH loved it! Tastes much more complicated than it is. A 2-yr-old could make this!! Be generous with the seasoning & sauce!
386849,199636,2008-07-14,4,"A very good, easy recipe.  Thanks!"
374506,199636,2008-08-25,4,"This was really good I pierced the skin with a fork and the soy seaped into the meat.  I made two quaters one for dinner and other was sippose to be for lunch the next day... well, it didn't make to lunch.  I ate it later on that same night.  Will make again.  Thanks for posting"
573644,199636,2008-10-05,0,Thanks for the good idea. My husband really loved it. I had bought quite a bit of leg quaters when they were on sale recently.
626995,199636,2008-10-11,5,"This is a wonderful, wonderful recipe. I bought a couple of chicken leg quarters because they were on sale, had no idea what to do with them, found this recipe, followed it, and proclaimed that we'd now be having chicken leg quarters on a regular basis. This recipe has just three ingredients, minimal prep, and is fabulously tasty. What a find."
999480,199636,2008-10-22,0,Sooooo simple yet soooooo good.  You really captured that  flavorful Chinese buffet chicken taste.  It's on my list of to die for good.  The skin is so crunchy and the taste of the chicken perfect.  This is a must keep recipe for chicken leg quarters.  Yummy!
297067,199636,2008-10-30,4,"Good, but next time I will add more garlic powder and soy sauce."
477886,199636,2008-11-21,5,So easy and so delicious. We've already made three times. I don't measure exactly and it still comes out great!! My DH loves the crispy skin!
206101,199636,2009-01-05,5,"Great, quick chicken for company when you have to throw something together. This is one for my Easy Access recipe and Tried and True collection! Delicious! Thank you, 3Killerbees."
254614,199636,2009-01-06,5,"This is great! Fast, Easy and Good.!"
136997,199636,2009-01-23,5,"Wonderful recipe! I don't normally bake chicken with the skin on, but because the ingredient list was so simple, I had to try it. I used legs and thighs and I placed them on a baking rack. I used my spray bottle to apply the soy and then sprinkled the garlic on them. Crisp and tender was the result. :)"
357987,199636,2009-01-27,4,"I thought this was really good.  Maybe I was expecting something more with all of the 5 star ratings.  But it was easy and quick on a weeknight.  Flavor was good, but with all respect not outstanding.  Will probably use this good go to recipe again.  Thanks for posting!"
482376,199636,2009-01-28,4,"Who knew a recipe so darn simple could be so good?!  I'm trying to cook a few more economical meals each week, and this recipe sure fit the bill. We really liked the flavoring. The chicken was mosit on the inside, just crispy enough on the outside (I baked mine for 1 hour) and the soy sauce was not overpowering at all. Thank you!!"
1150513,199636,2009-02-17,4,"Very easy, quick, and tasty!!! marinated for 1-2 hrs with soy sauce & garlic powder. Cooked Thighs for a little over 1 hr and turned out still very moist, got rid of a lot of the grease."
488617,199636,2009-02-28,5,"Very good, simple recipe.  The end product is similar to another recipe I like that uses about 8-9 ingredients.  I like crispy skin so I found it necessary to set the broiler on low and finish these up after the initial cook time.  Another bonus is that my kids really like baked chicken, this one included, so I need to remember to make it more frequently."
879716,199636,2009-05-15,5,Excellent - I can't believe I forgot to rate this one!  I made this in my crock pot with skinless thigh fillets.  I put them on low about 6 hours (overnight) and woke to the most heavenly scent.  When I tasted the chicken I ended up eating half my dinner that morning... lol.  Just too good to stop I guess.  Think I'll be making this for dinner very soon.  Thanks for this super easy tasty recipe! :)
633520,199636,2009-05-26,5,"As a poor University student I LOVE this recipe! All very cheap ingredients and I can easily make extra and use it to make other dishes. Also it takes very little time to prepare I just toss it in the oven and study while it's baking! Thank you for posting this yummy, easy, and inexpensive dish!"
48107,199636,2009-07-03,2,"I expected something amazing given all the five-star reviews, but I have to honestly say this was acceptable but not spectacular.  It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it wasn't anything to write home about, either.  Easy, definitely.  Moist, definitely.  But then simply baking leg quarters is easy and they come out moist.  There was almost no flavour other than the taste of the chicken itself, even though I pulled the skin back and poured soy sauce and garlic powder over the meat, then stretched it back over the chicken and did it again.  I'd probably have been better off just baking my leg quarters and serving a soy sauce-based dipping sauce on the side, or maybe marinating for an hour or so before baking.  Two leg quarters too just over an hour at 350F.  Sorry!"
1376928,199636,2009-09-22,3,"This was flavorful, but not my favorite.  I am still looking for that perfect way to bake chicken legs"
418128,199636,2009-11-11,5,I love this recipe!  It is my chicken leg quarter standard recipe!  I usually marinate the leg quarters in  low sodium soy sauce & powdered garlic for about an hour.  I also add some chopped garlic from a jar to the mix!  Serve with steamed rice and a veggie and you have a great and super easy relatively low cal dinner!
109566,199636,2009-11-19,5,"WOW!  This is terrific!  I was looking for a super-easy recipe for chicken thighs and this went above & beyond my expectations.  There was virtually no prep -- 5 minutes is entirely accurate -- and the house smelled divine as the chicken cooked.  The skin got perfectly crispy-crunchy, the meat was juicy, and the flavor outstanding.  This is a keeper, and one 'll definitely give to my college-age kids who are newbie cooks. Thanks 3KillerBs!!"
369264,199636,2009-11-21,5,"This was very tasty! :)  I made it with some split breasts I'd had in the freezer for a long time.  It was time to cook them up and I was not disappointed!  TENDER, flavorful meat. yum!  Thanks for the keeper recipe!"
357236,199636,2010-01-22,5,Wonderful! The chicken was not dry at all. Very easy. Thanks for posting. I will definately make it again.
458471,199636,2010-01-26,1,"Maybe it was the brand of sauce that I had...not sure, but this had no flavor at all. I would not use this again. Sorry."
147999,199636,2010-02-14,4,"I really enjoyed the Soy flavor. I am more of a Dale's guy, but I followed your recipe. I only added hot sauce. Great cooking directions as well. His1NOnly is way off and quite rude I may add. That person used the wrong sauce and rated your recipe one star?! Just RUDE! If after your recipe turned out under done chicken, that's one thing. But sauce flavor? I am offended for you 3B."
168831,199636,2010-02-23,5,using organic/free range chicken makes this really good!
743849,199636,2010-04-08,5,"This was really tasty (and REALLY easy). I used leg quarters. I added some other seasonings to the garlic powder (salt, pepper, cayenne powder, marjoram, onion powder), drizzled on the soy sauce, and baked with tin foil over the roasting pan for about an hour, and then I removed the tin foil and let the chicken skin crisp. DELICIOUS! I garnished with a bit of chopped fresh parsley and served with some mixed vegetables and rice. Thank you for sharing!"
111899,199636,2010-04-09,5,"This a great, simple, tasty, ""go-to"" recipe for chicken.  Perfect for a weekday meal when you're too worn out to do a heavy prep!  My family enjoyed it and it was nearly effortless!"
1474866,199636,2010-06-06,5,This was the easiest & juiciest chicken recipe I have ever made.  My DH loved it almost as much as my kids did! Thanks for sharing... :o)
1542289,199636,2010-08-06,3,"The chicken was undercooked even after an hour and 30 mins, and thats when I gave up. I MIGHT try this again, but not use chicken thighs."
792502,199636,2010-09-19,0,"Super simple to make. As a matter of fact, my 11 year old son made this. We covered the chicken with foil paper and baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes. We also scattered baby carrots around the chicken to add a side dish that could be baked with the chicken. We loved it!"
1356293,199636,2010-10-21,5,Fantastic taste and easy to cook! Those are my only two requirements when choosing the meal for the day and this recipe nailed both of them! Thanks so much for sharing!
521333,199636,2011-01-15,2,"Do people really need a recipe for this dish?  I make more authentic and involved Asian recipes than this.  However, if you're in a rush to make chicken quarters, you can't go wrong with this ""recipe"".  <br/><br/>For the people who complain about this chicken being greasy.....use a broiler/baking pan with grate folks!  If you have time, throw soy sauce with a chunk of fresh ginger in a mini-blender.  The taste will be twice as good."
1652446,199636,2011-01-18,5,Great recipe and so easy to make!
211329,199636,2011-01-21,4,"Easy to make, thats for sure! Love that part of it!!  Personally, I think it was a little bland and needed something.  Will definiately make again adding some other seasonings.  Thanks for a keeper!"
552864,199636,2011-01-22,5,"This was so easy and tasty, thank you!  I used my Nu-wave oven so I covered mine for the first part of the cooking time then let it crisp up, served with sweet pepper rice and steamed broccoli. What an easy meal. It really irks me when someone is rude about a recipe and sites how much more they can do...this site caters to all level of cooks and even us experienced cooks like new, easy recipes. At my house, we are very grateful and thankful for your time to share this with us, it was delicious!"
212497,199636,2011-03-09,0,I think some people have nothing better to complain about than other peoples recipes. This turned out wonderful for me. I added some seasoned salt and made sure to put seasonings between the skin and chicken (as well as on top) before I baked it. I didn't use Kikoman soy sauce and I had no problems. I baked it at 375 for 1 hour on the middle oven rack and the skin got crispy and delicious. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for posting.
687141,199636,2011-03-17,2,This was easy but my family did not like it. Kind of like baked greasy chicken with no flavor.
2037479,199636,2011-10-18,5,delious chicken and very easy. I made frozen stir fry lo mein with it. Great dinner!
2075796,199636,2011-11-21,0,A little Lawrys seasoning is so good!
2200148,199636,2012-03-03,4,I did this first as is and today I'm trying with Adobo seasoning. Good easy recipe with good flavor. Goes with almost any side you can imagine.
84272,199636,2012-04-15,4,Super easy and pretty good tasting as well.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks.
2264519,199636,2012-05-14,3,"Smelled amazing cooking - have to say, though, that  I was disappointed by the taste. Hardly any flavor in the meat. Then again I don't eat the skin so maybe I can try putting some of the flavor under the skin if I make again."
454625,199636,2012-05-20,5,"I thought this was great! My DH said it tasted like something you'd get a chinese restaurant. He thought it was delicious. I made this with organic skinless, boneless thighs. I poked them with a fork so the soy sauce would soak in.  I used low sodium kikkoman.  I sprinkled with garlic powder and also threw on some minced garlic. Baked at 350 for 45 min. So easy and so tasty! Next time I might throw some onions or mushrooms in the bottom of the baking dish."
141012,199636,2012-06-14,0,"I used the temperature and time you suggested for a chicken leg quarter recipe which i came up with... was perfect.. referring to the doneness of the chicken. I will stick to this temp time always. I am eager to try your simple recipe as it seems it will yield a similar tasting dish to mine. Mine had hoisin, sugar, garlic. Will try just soya and garlic as you have done...so easy and quick and i always have those ingredients in the house..."
305531,199636,2012-06-26,5,"So good! This was quick, simple, and tasty. Chicken was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Tag."
945836,199636,2012-07-10,5,"I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  I did do a couple of things differently. First, I used boneless, skinless thighs, which cut down on the greasiness that some people have mentioned. Second I marinated the chicken in the soy sauce for a couple of hours before baking. The flavor was great!  Not too spicy or too bland. Thanks for a great easy recipe!"
2352179,199636,2012-08-04,5,This was easy and delicious.  Thank  you!!
2417702,199636,2012-09-24,5,"Ok I just made this. Success!! But I did a few things different. I used the garlic powder and soy sauce but added some sweet chili sauce from the bottle I also sprinkled a little green onion. I also baked the legs and thighs on a roasting pan that drains the fat. I baked skin side up for about an hour 350 but turned them over, added more of the same ingredients and baked for about 30 minutes more. I drizzled some of the juices at the bottom of pan over chicken but my chicken came out beautiful! Not greasy, nice and brown and a little crispy. It was juicy and so tender.  I will be making this again! I served with wild rice and broccoli. The house smells amazing!!!"
2434846,199636,2012-10-05,4,"So easy and so tasty.  I thought I bought chicken breasts and found that I had thighs/leg quarters.  I sprayed my broiler pan (without grid) with garlic Pam, placed the chicken skin side up, sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled a nice coating of Herbes de Provence, and sprayed again with olive oil.  Baked at 350 degrees for 75 minutes.  Delicious and had great drippings for dressing the rice."
2463144,199636,2012-10-22,3,"I give this recipe at least 3 stars for its juiciness, appearance and aroma but I had some problems. I followed the directions in preparing the chicken and baked according to set time/temp. The chicken was undercooked and lacked flavor. I had to put it back in the oven at 425 for an additional 20 minutes to get it to stop clucking. I barely tasted the soy and the garlic was non-existent (which I am a garlic lover and therefore went overboard with it and still didnt taste it). I am thankful that it was very juicy or I would have had one upset family. Im thinking maybe it was the size of my chicken pieces. I must admit they were rather BIG. Overall, not bad. Thanks."
1565956,199636,2012-12-21,5,"Easy peasy AND tasty!  We used leg quarters, followed the recipe exactly, leaving them in the oven for 45 minutes.  Perfection - moist, crispy skin & was actually flavorful to me; I'm not sure about the other reviews mentioning lack of flavor.   Also, it wasnt as greasy as some others had mentioned.  Sure, there's some left on the baking sheet, but I used foil making the clean up process painless.  I wouldnt call it a ""a lot"" of grease, but it's not lean cooking, i'll tell you that.  I think next time i will pat the bottom of the chicken (after taking out of oven) for grease absorption & that will take care of grease (that may run) on your plate.  I too am grateful for this ridiculously easy & cheap (!!) recipe.  Simple enough for me to leave for my husband to start dinner while I am out running errands.  <br/><br/>I realize that this ""recipe"" might be too simple for some, but before you write an obnoxious review regaling how much better of a cook you are, you should check yourself...and probably move on to another website that may accommodate your pretentious palette.  Sorry but that review hit me the wrong way - not only was it entirely self centered (who posts a review on a recipe knocking it and then raving about their own cooking abilities??), but it also gave the rest of us a not so subtle slap for being simple.  Allow me to answer you question, ""Do people really need a recipe for this dish?"" with a hells yeah! people need this dish.  What we dont need is someone telling us to waste more time in the kitching playing with our mini blenders when we can prepare a 5 minute dish and actually enjoy the evening with our family!"
2634793,199636,2013-02-12,4,I can't believe this chicken was so tasty with only two ingredients! My family ate it up and so did I! Thank you!
2509783,199636,2013-03-05,5,Yummy! These were so good my kids gobbled them up in no time at all :) Made these according to directions and they came out perfect. We will definitely be making these again. Thank you for the recipe.
2724208,199636,2013-03-06,5,"Super easy, Quick, and Good. I want to cook it again tonight!"
142367,199636,2013-03-06,4,"Definitely a keeper. I will use tinfoil over the dish, as it dried out a bit, removing the foil about 15 minutes before the end of cooking time. Thank you for sharing."
2549237,199636,2013-03-17,4,"This chicken was so, so easy to make!  I made two chicken leg quarters and sprinkled very generously with garlic salt before adding Kikoman&#039;s soy sauce.  I had to bake my leg quarters for 1 1/2 hours at 350&deg; to get them cooked all the way through.  I also poked the chicken all over with a fork before placing the garlic and soy sauce.  My husband and I both enjoyed this and it will be my go to quick chicken recipe from now on.  I made this for Zaar Alphabet Soup Tag."
2730966,199636,2013-03-21,5,"I tried this recipe today and I really liked it! Plus, it made the whole house smell like a delicious chinese restaurant :)&lt;br/&gt;I will be making this one again - thank you for posting it"
2756925,199636,2013-03-27,5,I haven&#039;t rated anything in a long time.  I was looking fro something quick to cook for dinner because I normally use a slowcooker but I didn&#039;t bother.  It just came out the oven and it was so flavorful and juicy.  It took so quick to cook and I m serving it with brown rice and beans.  Thank you so much for taking your time to post this!!!
2899468,199636,2013-07-12,5,"This is by far the best baked chicken recipe I&#039;ve ever made! Super simple, yet tasty and sophisticated. I will be making this quite often now. I served this chicken with rice and stir fry and it was a restaurant quality. Thanks for the recipe."
1593589,199636,2013-08-09,5,I make this all the time with a few adjustments. I add onion powder and instead of soy sauce I use teriyaki sauce. I also fry the thighs first and then finish them off in the oven. So good.
1800036842,199636,2013-08-28,5,this was easy to prepare and it tasted great with the addition of chopped onions and potatoes on top.
140132,199636,2013-10-18,5,"What a simple idea and it tastes great too!  I always season my roasted chicken, but never thought of using soy.  So glad I tried your recipe, we loved it.  Thank you for sharing withus."
299583,199636,2014-07-18,5,"This was fabulous.  For all the gourmets out there go to the Epicurean site if you need something that takes 50 ingredients and 5 hours to make.  This is for the harried Moms that need to put something on the table easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing I did different was use lower sodium Kikkoman soy sauce (although I did use a lot, lol)  Also, I laid one of those thin short wire racks in my roasting pan (kind of what you cool cookies on) and when the chicken was done (mine were big so I let them stay in about 90 minutes).  I carefully drained off the oily fat and was left with the wonderful carmelizing which I scraped up and spread over each piece.  Even my picky young children ate it and believe me that is not the norm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you so much for such an easy delicious recipe.  I NEVER rate recipes as I&#039;m not all that into the whole sharing my thoughts on the web thing.  I put one recipe on this site when it was RecipeZaar and although not nearly as good as yours it is easy and clean up is a snap,  If you want to check it out I think I called it Easiest Chicken Dinner Ever or some dumb name.  It&#039;s been years!  It should be under my name mrsmwp even though they&#039;ve changed the heck out of this site since I was first on it!  Take care and thanks again!"
40100338,199636,2015-01-28,5,"I was looking for something different when baking chicken leg quarters and let me tell you, this recipe was it! Super easy and definitely not short on flavor. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It&#039;s definitely a keeper. My family LOVED it as well!"
1800271848,199636,2015-08-09,5,"Former here. First, the time depends on the size of your chicken. If you have large chicken pieces, it takes longer. Second, if you want even more flavor, go by 30 minute increments. For each 30 minutes add more garlic powder and soy sauce. For me, I had large hindquarters and thus needed 1.5 hours of baking time. I seasoned each 30 minutes (three times). Zero minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes. Delicious!"
2000399495,199636,2015-08-12,5,"I have actually done this before and after they are cooked I will put them in a large bowl with soy sauce and sliced onion and seal it for about 15 minutes shaking in a few times during that 15 minutes so the soy sauce and onion gets soaked in good.  Wonderful flavor!!!!
You can also if you like fried chicken to fry in sesame seed oil and put them in the bowl with onion and soy sauce.  But baking them is much more healthy!!"
350750,199636,2015-10-01,5,"DH had this cooking when I came home, it smelled so good!  It tasted good too.  Thank you!"
298447,199636,2015-10-09,5,"Way too easy to taste so good, but it is!  Thanks"
2000749280,199636,2015-12-16,5,"Out of all the fancy recipes for when I first looked up how to cook these chicken quarters that I got for so cheap, none has taste as good as this one. The butcher gives me huge quarters for only 39 cents a pound - just one of them can be 3+ pounds! I tried all kinds of recipes, and this one works out the best for me. Since they&#039;re so big, cooking time is a bit longer, but man do they turn out super crispy. I&#039;m a huge fan of skin, and if you are too, this makes it taste amazing! I never really thought of soy sauce for anything but rice, and those who don&#039;t like soy sauce itself, this makes it taste nothing like it, and enhances the chicken flavor so well. Good simple recipe that gets 5 star results every time!"
627970,199636,2016-01-03,5,"I have now made this three times...it is so consistently good, and so amazingly easy.  Who would have thought just a little soy could be so flavorful?!?  Thanks!"
36739,199636,2016-08-04,5,"I made this recipe as stated, except that I added about 1 pound (500 grams) of sliced fresh mushrooms. I sprinkled oil, salt &amp; pepper over them, and spread them around the chicken pieces (I used leg quarters). Thanks for the easiest recipe I ever made!"
128473,199636,2016-09-28,5,"This is a lovely recipe. Quick and easy to make with wonderful results. I love that it uses ingredients always found in the pantry. A wonderful example of how a few ingredients can create a stunning dish. Thanks for sharing, made for What`s on the Menu Tag Game."
2001278041,199636,2016-12-01,5,"Yep it was good. I had never thought about using soy sauce before, I served it with fried rice. I love fried rice."
2001400700,199636,2017-02-21,0,Wow great way to bake chicken. It made me feel so good about myself cause my daughter loved it with asparagus tips and mashed potatoes and garlic bread. Now i finally made it so tasty my lil girl was proud of me....Thanks man
2001451373,199636,2017-03-23,5,I made this awhile back looking for something simple and different. Had the guys over that night. I was a little skeptical because it called for simple ingredients soy sauce. Anyway it came out tender and crispy. It had a lot of flavor!! My picky boyfriend and his friend even loved this. Now when they come over they always ask for that. Thank you for sharing this simple deliciousness. I never thought it would come out so tasty I was wrong! I make this all the time now. You can even use leg quarters. I have used both leg quarters and chicken thighs comes out same!
2001474820,199636,2017-04-06,0,How long do i leave in the oven if using drumsticks
2001580196,199636,2017-06-11,5,"My family loves this recipe! We make it once a week. We even have the spice mix (minus the soy sauce) stored in the spice rack for easy grab and go. I don't have a brush so I use a spoon to ladle the soy sauce onto the chicken and thwn put a little around the chicken in the pan if I have some left (I dont measure it out, just pour some into a small bowl). Amazing and easy and great with pretty much any veggie and starch."
2001588985,199636,2017-06-18,0,"I tweaked this recipe some! I made a marinade out of 1 cup red wine, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, dash Worcester sauce, 1 teaspoon garlic (fresh grated in a food processor), 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, oregano (about 1/2 teaspoon) the same amount of tarragon, and fresh ground pepper. I used 2 chicken hind quarters ( skin on) placed marinade in a gallon ziplock bag with hind quarters. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, turning bag over about every half hour. After 2 hours I baked chicken for about 1 hr15 mins in an oven set at 350. My husband loved it, good chicken. Takes some time, but the end result was worth it!"

2001952042,199636,2018-01-24,5,"Highly recommend this method. The temperatures and times for baking the chicken gives consistently good texture and flavor. I personally do not recommend the flavor combinations, but that might be my own personal taste so I will not mark down the recipe for that since it can be easily personalized by substituting your favorite rub, seasoned salt, or just plain ol' S&amp;P!"
2002190064,199636,2018-06-18,5,I made this awhile back wanted to give something different a try. For those wondering don't tweak it much or you're changing the entire concept of this recipe. I am picky and was not sure about the soy sauce. I thought it would not be good. I still made it as is one night for my boyfriend and his friend on wrestling night. I was broke and wanted something cheap and tasty lol. Anyway they tore it up and I did! It is a staple now in my home. They kept asking me how did I make this what is in it? They are the most picky eaters and do not like much. They even do not like soy sauce at all..When I told them about your recipe and the 2 ingredients they were shocked. They said how do you take something we hate lol to love it lol So it's my go to when busy and not much time to invest in a planned out dinner! Thank you for sharing this!
129958,188440,2006-10-24,4,"These are quite easy to prepare, even using a knife, of course a mandoline would have been very nice to use!  I was a bit disappointed in the flavor of the shallots, they were a little bitter, but this could have been the shallots.  I did use vegetable oil and they cooked very nicely! DH and I had these on a salad tonight and they were good on the salad.  Thanks Sharon123!"
498271,370567,2012-08-01,4,"What a fun recipe!  You're right, it did take me a couple of tries to get the cheese right - had to find the right balance of time and temperature.  I used monterrey jack cheese and corn tortillas.  Served with salsa of course and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT8, Chefs gone WILD!"

400708,370567,2012-08-05,5,This is such a fun recipe and it was easy once you get the hang of it.  For me the trick was not to be in too much of a hurry with flipping the tortilla and cheese over giving it time to reach the right stage.  I like this so much better than regular quesadilla and instead of a snack had it for breakfast.  Added salsa and sour cream to the topping when eating and it was a pleasant light breakfast.  I'm thinking even the grandkids will like this one - specially if I add a few pepporonis to it on completion.  Made for ZWT 8 the Mexican leg
526666,370567,2012-08-08,5,"I love the fact that you say it may take more than one try to get the cheese right. I did need a second try, but it was surely worth the first mistake, that was tasty, nonetheless. You really do need a nonstick pan, so I dug my non-stick wok out, to insure great cheesy coverage. I used a pepper jack, which was a good choice. Nice and crunchy, this stood alone, tho I may have one with guac for lunch today! :D Would be great, as an alternative to grilled cheese, with a steaming bowl of tomato soup! I plan to remember this, when winter comes...Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Cookgirl!"
373020,370567,2012-08-12,4,"My kids enjoyed these for lunch, made for ZWT8, The Fearless Red Dragons"
949568,370567,2012-08-12,5,"very tasty, I like how it melted the cheese, and then the tortilla was a bit crunchy.  My kind of snack, quick and tasty and easy to clean up after!  Thanks Cookgirl!  Made for ZWT8 trip to Mexico."
361931,370567,2012-08-12,5,"Oh my gosh, we LOVE these things -- you can make it with any cheese, any time, and any size tortilla!  YUMMY!"
936601,174788,2008-09-14,4,"I didn't make the cake, just the sauce.  Very quick and yummy.  I added 2 Tablespoons of 2 % milk as well.  Thanks!"
6651,507064,2013-09-30,5,"These pies rate a 10 on the cuteness scale.  I made them twice.  Once as written, and the second time using canned apple pie filling.  Either way is good, but the pre-made filling cuts down on prep time."
542159,507064,2013-10-06,5,Fantastic idea! These are a bit labor intensive and highly recommend using large apples (mine were medium). We loved that these were very low fat; I made using 50% brown sugar and 50% regular sugar inside some tart Granny Smiths making for a nice sweet and tart combo. I used a biscuit cutter to cut the pie crust into a cute little cap. Love Kathy?s photo series and think next time might try her suggestion of using canned apple pie filling. Thanks for the post.
1803658019,507064,2015-01-14,0,Just Reyes this recipe for the first time. Delicious but is there a trick to stop the crust from falling off the sides??
80998,327979,2008-12-03,5,"I gotta admit that I wasn't sure I would like this.  However, I did.  It isn't sweet, so if you are looking for a ""milkshake smoothie"" look elsewher.  However, there is so much natural flavor and natural sweetness that it taste wonderful.  It certainly did put a pring in my step this morning.  Thanks Mike.  Made for bevy tag 2008."
464080,327979,2009-06-05,5,"Wow. . .this SO reminds me of Mexico. . .sitting by the pool with a plate of fresh fruit!  I did sub cantaloupe for the honeydew with excellent results.  The papaya really stands out here.  Mine was too thick for my blender, so I threw in 3 oz of unsweetened pineapple juice.  I love low calorie smoothies like this.  I am going to put a little in the fridge and mix it with some vodka tonight for a fruity martini. . .we shall see how that works!!!  Made for Veg*n Tag June 2009."
128473,327979,2009-06-19,5,"Another awesome smoothie from Syd. This was so good. I love melons in smoothies. The flavors blend really nice is this tropical smoothie. I especially love the flavor that the papaya brings to the mix. I used all frozen fruit for this, so I mixed in a little pineapple juice. Thank you so much for sharing this tasty treat."
679953,327979,2009-07-10,5,"GREAT SMOOTHIE YOU GOT HERE MIKE !!  Great combo of ingredients, and flavors.  Kind of reminded me of the days, that I was in South Texas near Mexico.  I did add a tad pineapple juice to this.  Made for PRMR tag."
38260,43756,2003-09-16,5,"Wow!  :)

We entertained my hubby's boss last night, and I made two of these to serve with Francese bread.  One with brie and one with gorgonzola.

The three of us ate both pies!!

I couldn't find brie wheels, so just used 1/2 pound wedges of each cheese, cut off the rind-stuff and layered slices on the bottom crust.  Put the top crust on, rolled and crimped the edges.

It smells so good while baking, and looks beautiful!  We couldn't wait the 15 minutes after baking, so I slid it to a small plate and dug in!

Who'd have thought such a simple recipe could be so impressive and yummy?!  I can't wait to try it with Feta cheese.

Thanks Di!!  :)"
185285,43756,2005-02-13,5,"Excellent!  Easy to make ahead of time!  I was using what I had around the house - reduced fat Brie, and it was great!"
369566,43756,2007-04-20,3,"I find this a bit heavy and I think it could use more flavor.  Perhaps something like a jam or honey inside the crust?  It is a nice easy way to dress up brie, though"
559414,43756,2007-08-13,1,The dough was virtually tasteless. Try a french bread dough rather than waste your brie on this.
400708,43756,2015-10-18,5,"When having company over I decided to try this recipe. When I saw the small ball of pastry I was sure it wouldn&#039;t be enough to cover the brie - but it was just right.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to top my Brie w/Mango Pepper Jam before covering it for some extra flavor and then egg washed it, and sprinkled w/Chinese 5 spice.  Turned out lovely (wish I&#039;d taken a photo of the cut part but it was eaten and gone before I could.)  The warm, creamy cheese with the golden pastry and the sweet, spicy flavor of the jam all went together to make a stunning appy.  Served w/crackers"
1710207,43998,2010-10-21,5,"This is the first cake I ever baked and it was simple and delicious! I only had enough sugar for one cup and I found this was plenty. i added a little extra cinnamon and vanilla and left out the nuts. I also soaked the cake in cider after it cooled, to intensify the apple taste. I shall be making this cake many times again!"
6357,43998,2002-10-27,5,"The CHAMPION of all cakes is this cake that absolutely is 'TO DIE FOR'! This is the FIRST FRESH FRUIT CAKE I have ever baked in my whole life! Let me tell you the ADVENTURE I had with the baking of this heavenly cake this evening...
I decided around 4:50pm to make this. I set off with my egg beater, bowl and all, by 5pm. These are the steps I followed to make the cake mixture:
1. I took a large mixing bowl and beat the eggs, one at a time, until light and fluffy, in it.
2. Next, I added sugar, salt, baking soda and cinnamon and creamed it all well together.
3. Then, I added oil( I used Minara Sunflower Cooking Oil) and all-purpose flour, alternately, and mixed it well.
4. Next in line, I tossed in the walnuts and stirred in the essence.
5. Then, in another bowl, I mashed 2 chopped bananas and added this to the above-made mixture.
6. Last of all, I grated the apples(I used 6 of them- delicious red apples) and added them to the mixture. I did not find it necessary to core the apples. It was easy to grate them once peeled, using my grater. I mixed this sinfully divine cake batter extremely well together.
At this point of time, the mixture was sooooo tempting, that I forgot my promises to myself of not to eat between meals, and, I put in my finger into the mixture and picked up a good bit of this mixture. The next second, as you can guess, it had made it's way successfully to the chamber of my mouth:) YUMMY! That very second I knew I'd hit the jackpot! 
Well then, in my excitement to get this done quickly, I greased a cake tin. I did not read ""UNgreased"" in your recipe because I was sooooo excited and to reach upto this point, it had taken me an hour(it was 6pm by now). 
I normally dont bake in my oven. I use my AMC Dutch Oven to bake all my breads and cakes and they all come out beautifully, so, as usual, I put the Dutch Oven on the stove and I was to start pouring this yummy mix into the cake tin, when, the doorbell rang. I ran off to get the door. My cook had arrived. Once he enters, I don't cook:)
So, I covered the cake mixture and kept it in my refrigerator. Well, then, by 9pm my cook left home. I got into the kitchen, took out this bowl of the cake mixture, oh my! It was smelling so good!! I wanted to eat it all right away then and there! God bless the powers that stopped me from doing that because of what I got 3 hours from 9pm..read on:)

I thawed the cake mixture for 30 minutes. 
At 9:30pm, I poured it into the greased cake tin and baked it. It took 2.5 hours to bake in my Dutch Oven on very low flame! (My dad jokingly teased me saying that I got to pay for the coming month's gas cylinder supply! LOL):)
Ofcourse, the naughty girl that I am, I went about 5 times and opened the lid up, did the toothpick test, no regrets, it wasn't done, as everytime I did the test, I got to lick a yummy bit of this divine and truly addictive cake:)
At dot 12am, the alarm on my Dutch Oven went off!
Mom called out to me saying that the entire house was smelling WONDERFUL! As I got closer to my kitchen, Oh my, the smell, was getting stronger and stronger...
FINALLY- I lifted the lid off the cake tin, checked the cake, YES, DONE!
WOW! YUM! That's all I whispered to myself:)
Got the cake off the flame, out of the cake tin, and once it was out, it smelt heavenly.
My parents said it smells soooooooo good, my bro., the most picky eater alive, said he wanted it all and I am NOT to share it with anyone:)
I'll confess I ate a bit before I took it to them all:) You can't blame me now, having heard my story, can You? :-)

Thank You for sharing this truly 500000000+ stars deserving recipe! Please do convey my ""VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU"" to your friend, i.e., who gave you this recipe.

54697,43998,2002-10-29,5,"After reading Charishma's review, I just had to try this.  We're going to a potluck this evening and I needed an easy dessert.  This smelled delicious baking and tastes even better.  I used golden delicious apples just because I had them and pecans.  This is definitely a keeper.  I'm taking whipped cream, but it really doesn't need anything else. "
37258,43998,2002-11-14,5,"This was delicious cake and very easy
to put together.  I used the golden 
delicious apples as well as pecans, 
and with the addition of the banana, 
it was a wonderfully moist cake but 
not soggy.  
We loved it.  "
27124,43998,2002-11-20,5,"If it sounds good to you, trust me, it tastes even better!!  If you have really sweet apples (I used 3 MacIntosh & 3 Granny Smith), you can cut back on the sugar - I used 1 1/2 cups and it tasted sweet and awesome."
5743,43998,2003-04-29,5,"Very tasty and moist. My husband made this a few nights ago. He omitted the nuts and used a bundt pan. I would suggest sticking with the 9x13-inch pan, I don't think it cooked all the way through. We're both eating it every night, just the same. While it was still warm, we served it with a scoop of coffee ice cream. Delicious. Hubby says this was an easy recipe. I say it was yummy. "
82367,43998,2003-06-25,5,"I was initially just a wee bit disappointed with this cake , (maybe i set my sights too high after reading all of the reviews)I cut it just a few hours after it came out of the oven for a little taste test and it was not as moist  as i had expected(although it was not dry either)However it certainly redeemed itself the next day,this cake is much better on the second day, as is most baked goods with banana(at least in my experience)I used the walnuts and  followed the recipe exactly.I used Macs but next time i may be tempted to try another variety. This cake only took 35 minutes to bake,an hour would have been far to long (at least in my oven it would have been.) Would be very nice with a little cool whip on top. A very tasty & moist cake that is easy to make. I would make this again.:)"
56986,43998,2003-09-24,5,"Apples and bananas, what a great combination in a cake.  I thought I'd try something different from my usual zucchini bread that I make for my daughter and husband to take for lunch.  I had lots of bananas and apples at home so this was a perfect recipe for me to try.  The cake turned out very moist and it was the first time I didn&#8217;t have to butter and flour the cake pan.  It really doesn&#8217;t stick.  Just so you know I used a glass baking dish. I also saved time by using Charisma&#8217;s idea of grating the whole apples after peeling them, instead of cutting them, coring them and then grating them. I live in Cyprus and the bananas are small so I wasn&#8217;t sure how many to use so I estimated 5 bananas and it turned out fine.  Also I sprinkled chocolate chips over half of the cake for my daughter who refuses to eat any cake unless it has some kind of chocolate on/in it and she loved this cake.  Great recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.   "
63318,43998,2003-09-29,5,This cake is STILL moist after 3 days!  I was eating it out of the cake pan with a fork today because it's almost gone!  Yum!
77595,43998,2003-11-05,4,i tried this today for the first time and really enjoyed it. Even the kids loved it. I added raisins to it and it came out delicious. I am going to make several small loaves and give them out for the holidays.
71298,43998,2003-11-09,5,Great cake. Unique taste;something similar to a carrot cake. I didn't have enough apples so I added a cup of applesauce. Baked for 35 minutes. I frosted the top with a cream cheese frosting in which I added rum extract.
1429901,471666,2014-01-21,0,"Note to reviewers: I want to give this recipe a 5-star rating, but the stars wouldn&#039;t stay red!"
93095,173396,2006-06-21,4,"This was very good!  Nice, clear instructions too, thanks for sharing this recipe!"
185285,43998,2005-05-28,0,"I'm holding off on a rating because I made a substution:  1 cup of grated apple for 1 banana.  The rest of the recipe, I followed according to instructions.  My cake never set in the middle.  I baked it for as long as the perimeter could take it (1 hour 15 min) and still had a VERY undone center.  The finished product was not edible.  I am holding off a review, but would reccomend following the recipe to a T, and getting some specifcs on how much a 'generous' cup of apples is."
186071,43998,2005-10-05,4,A nice tasty and very easy cake to put together. Moist with out being wet but abit heavy in texture.   I used 6 macintosh apples. Unfortunatly apple taste is not very dominant. It tastes very similar to a carrot cake. All in all a tasty and easy cake.
500410,43998,2007-05-16,5,"I modified the recipe a bit by using only 3 medium apples (since I didn't have enough apples)and decreased the sugar to 1-2/3 cup since my family like food not as sweet, but the cake was still fantastic! As the author described, the cake was very moist. The texture is soft but slightly chewy, which fits my family's taste well. I also like how the taste of banana is not as strong as banana cakes because I often find the banana aroma in banana cakes too over whelming."
530520,43998,2007-10-20,5,This is absolutely delicious!  I made it according to the recipe (though I added the cinnamon to the wet ingredients) and my whole family loves it.  Next time I will try adding the nuts.  I will definitely be making this again - a great way to use overripe bananas and apples!
133174,43998,2008-03-29,5,This is a fantastic snack cake.  The recipe was reduced by half and baked in a 9 inch square pan.  A combination of Splenda and sugar was used.  The peel was left on the apple and all the wet ingredients were blended in the Vita-Mix.  The cake is very moist and has a delicious combination of flavors.
537188,43998,2008-04-05,4,"I really like the idea of combining apple and banana in one cake - it makes the banana taste less powerful. In itself the cake tasted lovely, but it did have a slightly floury after taste (I don't whether it could have come from the apple or not). However, it still made a great tasting cake!"
980739,43998,2008-11-05,5,"This cake was absolutely delicious, moist, and highly flavorful. It was also one of the easiest and quickest cakes I've ever put together. I actually used two loaf pans for this recipe, and it came out great! Bravo!"
173579,43998,2008-12-06,5,Great tasting bread. It is so moist it will just melt in your mouth.  Will be making this again  and again.  Thanks for posting.
953910,43998,2009-02-26,5,absolutely fabulous!  didn't make any changes as i tend to do and i'm so glad because having eaten this for the past 4days i can't say i would want to alter this at all!  was asked to make this again already!  thanks for posting :)
1214989,43998,2009-03-25,5,"I only had 3 apples so added a grated carrot and this turned out to be everything it said it would be, moist and delicious.  I didn't add as much sugar, only 1andahalf cups which is still sweet enough especially with the sweetness of the fruits.  This recipe is a keeper!"
1231048,43998,2009-04-08,5,"WOW! This was so moist and delicious, with the perfect balance between the apple and banana flavor! I joined RecipeZaar just so i could rave about how amazing this cake is! The edges and the top of the cake are slightly crisp, and the center is so moist and fluffy! I omitted the walnuts, and sprinkled the top of the cake with cinnamon streusel topping. I will definitely make this again and again!"
1340841,43998,2009-08-03,5,"I must say this cake is very good. If you want a bundt cake read on: My bundt cake cooked all the way through. If you want this cake as a bundt, you must cook it for 15 minutes @ 350 degrees then lower temp to 340 degrees for 45 min. total cook time a hour. I will try 340 degrees for  a hour the next time to see if that work too, but the way I cooked it this time, worked like a charm. As far as the recipe I love sweets but the taste of sugar was over powering, I could taste the bananas and pecans but not so much the apples which would give more of a natrual sweetness. I suggest decreasing the sugar by 1/2 or 1 cup if it's a bundt, to be fair, it may be the fact I made it a bundt instead of 9 X 13 that may account for the sugary taste. Still a very addictive cake that you would enjoy. Also may I suggest not handling the batter too much, I folded the dry ingredients in by hand and that's all it needed, that way your cake won't be tough. Also I used a non stick bundt pan and I had a hard time getting the cake out, so I will suggest a light cooking spray if you have it on hand. Glad I found this recipe, it's a keeper."
371738,43998,2009-10-01,5,"I didn't grate the apples, but diced them instead.  Nice when you bite into the softened apple pieces.  Made this into 24 muffins instead.  So truly moist; haven't had a moister muffin/cake EVER.  My boys can't get enough of them.  Awesome with a glass of milk."
303042,43998,2010-03-02,5,the easiest and the tastiest.thank u!
107583,43998,2010-07-03,5,"As ""advertised"", this IS very moist and delicious!  I made it a bit more ""diabetic"" friendly by using Splenda brown sugar blend (1 cup).  Served with a dollop of fat-free, no sugar added vanilla yogurt, but really doesn't need anything on it.  Reminded me of a ""blondie""."
108931,43998,2010-09-14,5,"This was SOOO good!  I made as written, using pecans and poured into muffin cups.  Baked for 18 minutes at 350.  I would definately call these muffins rather than cupcakes, but they are great and relatively easy to make.  The most difficult part was grating the apples (which wasn't really that hard - just messy). This one recipe made 24 muffins with batter left over to make in 2 mini loaf pans (approx. 1/2 full).  Thank you for sharing!"
784788,43998,2010-11-27,5,"I made this some months back & making again today.  I deviated from the recipe since I didn't have 4 cups of apples.  I made up for the apples with shredded sweet potato, used melted organic virgin coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also added unsweetened shredded coconut and decreased the amount of sugar.  <br/><br/>I'll do pretty much the same thing today, but will be using cooked sweet potatoes (thought I would be making candied yams) and sweetened coconut flakes (couldn't find unsweetened) so will decrease the sugar even more."
1882319,43998,2011-04-13,5,I loved this recipe.  I used 2 granny smith apples and 2 single servings of applesauce.  I also used 3 tsp (1 tbsp) of cinnamon and 1cup of sugar.  This cake turned out supper moist and tasty.  I topped it off with cream cheese frosting.
1912486,43998,2011-05-19,5,"I couldn't grate the apples, so I chopped them instead. I also used less sugar, like what others have done. It turned out great. My mom and I couldn't stop eating it. :)"
1924863,43998,2011-06-04,0,"I love this recipe!! I made it for my son's first birthday party and everyone (including him) loved it!  It's one of the easiest cakes I've ever made and it's also one of the tastiest!  It stays moist in the fridge for days afterward too, so make extra for yourself!!<br/><br/>I dress mine with a simple cream cheese frosting - it's delicious! <br/>1 pkg cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup 1icing sugar: beat cream cheese, butter and vanilla until smooth - add icing sugar about 1/4 at a time - very easy<br/><br/>Thank you for sharing this recipe  :)"
242578,43998,2011-09-20,5,Fabulous cake! Thank you for sharing the recipe. <br/>I used 2 granny smith and 4 red-delicious apples for my apple mix. Not taking out the core helps in shredding (followed what a reviewer wrote).<br/>Ran out of cinnamon so added a bit of cloves and nutmeg. Heavenly mix of spices :).<br/>Thank you again for sharing this wonderful and easy recipe. Will be making it again!
948167,43998,2011-10-17,5,"Wow! Talk about moist!! I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of the 2 cups of sugar stated and I also used 1 and 1/3 cups of all-purpose flour and 2/3 cup of whole wheat to try to make it a bit ""healthy"". I also used 3/4 cup of roughly chopped walnuts. The cake isn't very sweet which makes it perfect for after dinner, as a snack between meals or in the morning on-the-go. Not sure what kind of apples I used as I had recently been apple picking and just grabbed 5 of whatever was in the bag. This is definitely a great way to use us some old bananas and to try to make a dent in that 25lb bag of apples you have lying around! Enjoy!!"
2298800,43998,2012-06-18,5,"I found it to be very easy, delicious and moist. I used rum soaked bananas in the recipe which kept everybody smiling."
363055,43998,2012-10-05,5,This cake is awesome!!  I made exactly as written and would not change a thing.  Will make this cake often.
1375557,43998,2013-02-24,4,"Very good! Really enjoyed this cake. I used a bundt pan instead of a 9x13 and it turned out just as good. I used sweet apples and took the advice of another reviewer and used 1 and 3/4 cup sugar and was perfect. This cake is awesome just as it is, no icing is needed. Will definitely make this one again."
2839250,43998,2013-05-25,4,"Not too bad at all!  If you are using a convection oven I suggest you adjust temp and/or cooking time accordingly.  For a twist, instead of using any type of nut, I used one half cup of chocolate morsels.  Just carefully folded them into the batter.  Very tasty receipe, thank you!"
2871565,43998,2013-06-21,0,"Hi, i tried this last night and it turned out very good and tasty...although i used only 3 apples instead of 4 cups and no cinnamon it turned out tasty...thanks for the recipe, it was easy for a beginner like me :)"
148894,43998,2013-10-31,5,"I&#039;ve made this at least six times now. It is super moist and delicious! Everyone LOVES it. If your shy on the 4 cups of apple, just add more banana. This cake is a coffee cake AND a dessert cake dressed up with fresh whipped cream. Yummy."
1800226810,43998,2013-11-10,5,This was a very delicious recipe! My husband and I enjoyed it for afternoon tea. Thank you so much for posting this!!!
2594577,43998,2014-11-26,5,"I made this cake a few weeks ago and my daughters loved it. I used equal portions of banana and apple and it worked out perfect for me. As others, I decreased the sugar due to using sweet apples to begin with. Thank you for sharing. Per my daughters request, I will be making this again today. Excellent recipe."
2000264423,43998,2015-06-12,5,"Really good! I made a couple of minor changes;
1. I didn&#039;t bother to peel the apples (I used red ones, not granny smiths, though), 
2. As another person suggested, only used about 1.75c sugar instead of 2. Probably doesn&#039;t make much difference though. 

Came out amazing, and yes, you really don&#039;t have to grease the pan (I was worried about that instruction!!). Really good with caramel sauce."
2000546745,43998,2015-10-25,4,"Easy, moist, and absolutely delicious!"
2000650750,43998,2015-11-07,5,This cake is delicious. I used 2 dark metal loaf pans and took the loaves out after 40 minutes. They were perfectly cooked and moist. I used 1 Granny Smith and 3 Gala apples. I also added some chopped almonds and dry ginger. Great Recipe!!!
2000798489,43998,2016-01-03,5,I did 1 banana and added a cup of dried cranberry with just one Apple and kept the rest as it is. Turned out amazing n moist n delishhh
2000958290,43998,2016-04-05,5,"Soooo good! I made a couple substitutions as follows:

In addition to the banana (mashed) and apples (small chunks), I added 1 cup of finely grated carrots as well and omitted the nuts (didn&#039;t have any).

I substituted whole wheat flour for all purpose.

I used 1 cup of palm sugar instead of 2 cups regular sugar (and the cake was more than sweet enough for me!).

I used 1/2 cup of soft room temp. butter instead of oil. 

I split the cake into two 9x6 pans and baked for approx. 45 mins.

This cake turned out so wonderfully delicious, it will be a staple recipe for me!"
218535,43998,2016-11-12,1,This was soggy and wet. Terrible.
2001247031,43998,2016-11-15,0,"why UNgreased pan, not so sure about this! I want to try this today."
2001252560,43998,2016-11-18,5,"Made this today. Followed recipe exactly then sprinkled pumpkin seeds across the top - delicious! Not too sweet, lovely and moist, and very, very tasty! :)"
2001455597,43998,2017-04-10,5,"Omg it's heaven sent, thank you thank you so very very much."
2001126552,43998,2017-05-02,0,"This a superb recipe and seems to have a lot of leeway. I used 4 very ripe bananas and about 2 cups chopped (food processor ) sliced apples (with peel) from the local megamart that were about to go over. Added the nuts (big improvement, I think) and cooked in a Pyrex 9x13 pan. It is very moist. I think the negative reviews that said it was too moist just don't like it that way or somehow added too much fruit. I'll make this again soon. Maybe an excuse to make some hard sauce?"
2001607392,43998,2017-07-01,0,Big well done for this cake many many thanks for this recipe
2001801800,43998,2017-11-17,5,"This is really easy to make, so moist and scrumptious. I once added mince dates half the weight of sugar and rest brown sugar. Once again just 1/3 less sugar and more apple.. I also mix wholemeal flour and more nuts to make it healthier, still come our really yummy and my little ones love it.."
128473,184577,2014-03-04,5,"Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe.  It resulted in a very tasty treat for my lunch today.  It was perfect.  Light, fluffy tender and full of flavor.  I decided to fill the center with homemade apple sauce.  So glad that I did, it was terrific with the pancake.  I will be making this again, it was so quick and easy to throw together.  made for Name That Ingredient Tag Game."
1800281166,507578,2013-11-19,2,"I think this will turn out o.k.  I am giving a low star rating because there are ingredients in the list that are not used in the directions!  What about the sugar?  What about the chopped butter?  I will be looking online at other recipes to figure out how to finish this recipe, as I feel like those ingredients might be important!  Also, doesn&#039;t say whether baking dish needs to be greased or ungreased."
169430,513817,2014-03-14,5,"I&#039;m so happy that I found this recipe. I love barley but for some reason way under use it eben yhough I always keep it on hand. I did need to add a little more broth but that isn&#039;t uncommon, I ofyen need to add extra liquid to grain&#039;s and flours where I live. The recipe was cut in half and I used several cremini&#039;s for the portabella as I had them (same mushroom just different sizes). It came out delicious and I used it as my main last evening along with green leaf, tomato and Havarti salad. Thanks so much Vic. :D"
1179225,513817,2014-03-26,5,"Really good and filling! I was out of mozzarella so I I used shredded swiss and would use it again. I ended up baking mine for an hour and twenty mins. before topping with cheese. What an economical way to eat healthy, thanks for posting the recipe."
145960,105670,2004-12-26,5,"These are AWESOME!  If I were going to the moon and could only take 5 foods, these jalapeno poppers would make the list.  I   used Neufchatel in place of cream cheese.  I made the poppers along with other appetizers for a Christmas lunch I hosted and each guests averaged 4.15 poppers.  Sorry, my husband is a math major. "
182905,105670,2004-12-27,4,"we make something similar to this on the bbq circuit, but they are are called ABT, instead of topping with cheddar cheese, we use pulled pork. We never can make enough of them.Those that dont like Jalapeno Peppers, LOVE these."
283483,105670,2007-01-27,5,My husband and sons raved over these. My husband said they were addictive. :~D This is definitely a keeper in our house. Thanks for the recipe AZRoxy63.
311566,105670,2007-02-11,5,These were just great....hot or cold. Adding this one to my favorites. Thanks!
27706,105670,2005-02-02,5,"These ARE good!  Instead of sprinkling the cheddar on top, I mixed shredded Colby/Monterey Jack with the cream cheese.  I absent-mindedly scratched my chin while cleaning the peppers (should know better after 50 yrs. of cooking) and have washed it three times, but it still stings.  But the peppers didn't taste hot at all.  Some magic in the cream cheese???  Definitely on my list of Xmas Eve hors d'oeuvres."
47579,105670,2005-02-24,5,Great recipe! Couldn`t stop eating them. My son- in- law even partook and thought they were good and he hates anything spicy!!! Thanks for the recipe!
107152,105670,2005-03-04,5,"This is a great recipe!  Very easy to make and is delicious.  I'm doing the low carb thing, so will be making these contstantly. Probably the best recipe I've gotten off this site.  Thank you Stephanie!!!"
99624,105670,2005-03-06,5,Great appetizer-we love them!
197971,105670,2005-03-13,5,"Wow! I did love this Stephanie. If I could give it more stars I would. This really hit the spot! My pictures my look a bit drab, but these were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, however reduced the recipe as I wasn’t having a party to only 4 peppers, halved, for the 2 of us. DH doesn’t like peppers so I also used hollowed out mushrooms and prepared them exactly the same. Fantastic for both of us! I cannot find jalapeno poppers anywhere in the UK and was looking to make them myself. This recipe was even better than store-bought as it doesn’t have all the calories of the bread crumbs and the deep frying. Bacon isn’t the same here as it is in the states, but I used what is called ‘streaky bacon’ for this. Thanks for this recipe. It will certainly be used often. "
149396,105670,2005-04-24,5,These little gems are outstanding!!  They make a huge batch in no time at all.  I softened the cream cheese and mixed the cheddar into it. That way I didn't have to carefully top each pepper with the cheddar.  I made them all up and popped them in the frige to set up the cream cheese and prepare the rest of the goodies for the meal.  I might try spraying the tin foil with a little cooking spray because some of them stuck a little.  Thanks for a simple but impressive appetizer!!
58836,105670,2005-04-25,5,I haven't actually used this recipe but I have made these.  They are absolutely wonderful.  I could eat the whole lot of them by myself.
72254,105670,2005-04-30,5,"These were absolutely wonderful. Easy to make.  Next time, I hope I find hotter jalepeno's.  The one's I had for this one were way too mild :(
These were great. Thank you. They are definatly a keeper."
214552,105670,2005-05-09,5,I make these but cook them on the grill and omit the cream cheese! They are wonderful. Any idea if they can be kept warm in a crock pot?
218327,105670,2005-06-14,5,I can't imagine a more blissfull heavenly experience.. YUMMY!
243267,105670,2005-09-15,5,OMG! By far the best snack and/or appetizer that anyone I know has ever tasted! I think this is definitely the BEST recipe on this website!
40959,105670,2005-10-04,5,My close group of friends now ask for these EVERY time we spend the evening together! They LOVE 'em and can't get enough! 
52125,105670,2006-05-19,5,"There is not much to say about these, except they are just to die for EXCELLENT! Thanks for posting this recipe STEPHANIE LILLARD...."
59163,105670,2006-05-21,5,"These were fabulous.  If you don't like them as spicy take out most of the membrane inside of the pepper, this contributes to the heat level.  A little time consuming to make but definately worth the effort.  I think you could easily make these a day ahead and then just bake them when you need them."
202661,105670,2006-05-22,5,"IF, and I repeat IF, you have any of these left over; cut off the stems and pop them in a morning omelet.  Talk about fabulous!  I love this recipe.  I made far too many for my family of four, so I put some in omelets the next morning and family members who don't even like eggs snarfed them down.  You can cut out the seeds and the membranes if you don't like them spicy, but I find that the cooking process itself turns down the heat a bit.  Thanks for the recipe."
310843,105670,2006-05-22,5,"These have been a family favorite for years!!
If you use a grapefruit spoon, it is easy to remove the membranes and seeds.  We have also 1/2 cooked the bacon first so that it gets a bit more crispy without overcooking the peppers."
284060,105670,2006-05-28,5,"Really great appetizer recipe!  I halved the recipe for 4 of us, and it was just right.  You dont really get the heat from the jalepenos until the end, and the bacon is a great twist on this otherwise standard appetizer. Highly recommend!"
295591,105670,2006-06-19,5,"These where AMAZING, I loved them! Just make sure you get all the vains out of peppers."
321820,105670,2006-06-25,5,"Oh so good! I made only 6 jalapenos for my husband and myself and these were great, in fact I wished I had made more. I can't wait to make them for friends, they will be very impressed. Thank you for this super easy and delicious recipe."
181924,105670,2006-06-26,5,Awesome!!!
28784,105670,2006-08-27,5,So Yummie and easy.  They taste like mini chili Rellenos except better b/c they arent fried.  I used turkey bacon and they came out great.  I had to make 3 batches b/c the guests kept requesting more.  Awesome.  Thanks
183964,105670,2006-09-06,5,"These peppers rock. I made them last weekend for a movie night with friends and they were inhaled! I made them again tonight just for me and Dugan as an entree. Last weekend I filled them to the rim with cream cheese and then put shredded cheddar on top and wrapped with bacon. THe excess cheddar cheese bubbled over and most of it was lost. But they were delicious, anyway. Tonight, I half filled them with cream cheese and using my finger I formed a ""well"" and then filled the well with shredded cheddar til it came to the top of the rim (but level instead of heaping)of the cut peppers. I had no spillage or leakage of any cheese and they were not only delicious but beautiful. I also used a variety of peppers. Red jalapeno, green jalapeno, and banana peppers. They were all delicious. I prefered the green and Dugan preferred the red. But if you have picky guests consider the banana peppers, also. They have ZERO heat but are also outstanding and delicious. I would happily pay money for these in a restaurant. One other point... be sure to use regular or thin sliced bacon. The first time I used thick cut (because that was what I had) and it took some time under the broiler to crispen. But that only validates my point. Which is... you can't screw these up... they are wonderful and Dugan wants me to tell you that this is the best recipe I have force fed him from 'Zaar. And I have made him eat alot of recipes from 'zaar. He loves you! "
350695,105670,2006-09-09,5,I loved this recipe. I added the cheese to my cream cheese mixture and also added chopped cilantro and green onion to the cheese mixture. I did notice though that the bottom of the poppers didn't cook as well. The fatty part of the bacon was on the bottom. I will next time wrap them differently. Put the seam at the bottom so they don't come apart. They are VERY YUMMY!!!!!
327281,105670,2006-09-14,5,"Fabulous.  Can't wait to make them again - although they disappeared so fast that I'm going to have to make double next time.  I'm not entirely sure what jalapeno peppers are (apart from the pickled ones in jars), so I used the usual green chillies that you get in UK supermarkets.  Really easy to prepare ahead (I made them up in the morning, ready to pop in the oven later in the day)."
290994,105670,2006-09-18,5,"YUM! These are so fabulous! These were easy to make, and boy did they disapear quickly.Thank you for the great GLUTEN FREE recipe. These will be made over and over again! "
35526,105670,2006-09-19,5,I took these camping and cooked them on a grill.  I just made a slit and removed the seeds and slipped in a piece of cream cheese and a piece of cheddar.  They were such a hit.  We will have these next time we camp too.  YUM
347631,105670,2006-09-20,5,These were so easy and delicious. I took them to a party to watch football and everyone loved them.
169969,105670,2006-09-23,5,These are AWESOME!!! I followed the tips left by Pot Scrubber and they came out fantastic. DH2B asked me to make them again tonight! I love poppers but the whole deep frying ordeal is such a pain - We didn't miss the breading at all.... and who can go wrong with bacon!!!! FABULOUS!!!!
49561,105670,2006-10-03,5,"This was very good.  The first time hubby made this -- well he didn't cook it long enough and they were super hot!  We found out the longer we bake them, the less hot they get and a little more sweet.  Don't get the impression though, that these don't get hot -- they are still pretty hot :D  Thanks for the appetizer!"
340576,105670,2006-10-09,5,"These are fantastic, particularly for low-carb'ers, and so simple to make! I wound up using thick-sliced bacon, which meant cooking them for about 25 minutes. They were worth it and, since the cream cheese and bacon mellow the jalapeno flavor even my teenager liked them."
326540,105670,2006-10-15,5,These were lovely and tasty.  Just the right balance of zing and cheesey taste.  I also cooked them for a little longer as I like bacon to be crispy.  They got eaten very fast!
158086,105670,2006-10-16,5,made these for euchre...they were a big hit....but boy are the a pistol to clean...the fumes were really getting to me...I had the front door open so I could get some fresh air and it was 30 degrees out...haha
230557,105670,2006-10-22,5,"Rich, creamy, and just the right amount of heat.  I added real bacon bits and mixed the cheeses together, then pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave so it'd be nice & crispy.  My 1lb. Oscar Meyer bacon package had 10 slices - enough for 20 peppers, with a little cheese mixture left over for some yummy stuffed mushrooms.  Clean up was easy because I used release foil.  The worst part of prep was scraping out the seeds - that took longer than the total 10 min. prep time listed - but overall it's an easy recipe.  Thanks!"
289066,105670,2006-11-09,5,This is my favorite way to have Jalapeno Poppers.  Another variation that we do is to omit the cheddar cheese and use a maple bacon - great combination of flavors!
141898,105670,2006-11-09,5,"OMG!! YUMMY!! ADDICTING!! Can I give it 10 stars?? I have made this for every possible occasion in the last 3 weeks I could think of! Really yummy with maple flavored bacon too. My SIL (sister-in-law) made them on the grill one night- she skewered them and cooked them- yummy too! 
The only change is- serve them when they are hot- not cool (unless you like room temp. bacon????) You can save a few calories by placing them on a paper towel once cooked but before serving (to soak up some of the bacon fat). And remember- the funny thing about jalapenos is that some are hot and some are not- and you never know until you bit in!! 
PS-DO NOT touch your eyes (or anyone else's) while taking the seeds out of the jalapenos!! I use a spoon to just scrap out the seeds."
83093,105670,2007-01-12,5,"Hugely popular item on my Christmas appy table! The only changes I made were mixing both cheeses together & adding (2) minced chipotles to ""up"" the heat quotient as my jalapeno peppers were big ones, thus not very hot.  I short-baked them the day before my party (10 minutes), covered & refrigerated, then finished them off at serving time (another 10 minutes).  I already have requests to make these again! Thanks for sharing!"
235355,105670,2007-01-26,5,Holy WOW!!!  These are fantastic!  I wasn't sure I'd like them because I'm not a big fan of bacon wrapped anything so I made them mostly for my DH.  Turns out I LOVED them - so he had to share!!!  Definitely try this recipe!
13796,105670,2006-11-11,5,"Ok.. I have to add my two cents here. Thess are delicious! BUT. ..  The wrapping of the bacon was too time consuming for me. My back started to hurt. My guests like the hot stuff and will eat these like candy. The firt batch I did as directed. My jalapeÃ±os weren't hot. They were all different sizes but none were really 'kickin'.  So... Second batch:   I sprinkled the insides of the peppers with a little Kosher salt and a bit of ground habanero pepper. These turned out very good.. but again..  it was too time consuming (and expensive) for me to wrap them in bacon. Some of them would tilt over and the bacon would unwrap a little. It was just not the easy appetizer I've been reading about here. Ok..    then I came up with this:  I sprinkled the pepper with the salt and hot pepper, stuffed with cream cheese and then sliced the bacon crosswise into a little less than 1/2-inch pieces and put a piece of bacon on the top of the cream cheese in each pepper half. I then sprinkled with some chili powder. Now I don't have to use 2 pounds of bacon. I used about 5 slices of bacon. The flavor of the bacon is still there. 
Thanks for a great recipe. They are good no matter how you cook them. I just like to make things as easy as I can. Now I can whip these up in no time. "
264339,105670,2006-11-17,5,"Oh so very good..really really good..
not with this recipe but others I've made with wrapping bacon around something..
I've learnt a little trick..
I kinda ""pre cook"" the bacon a while maybe about 2 min..(just check every few seconds..I also pre cut with my kitchen shears before nuking if it calls for half slices)
anyhow back to THIS recipe..WONDERFUL...EASY and a hit!!

UPDATE NOV 17th

My son liked these so much HE is making them for a football party he is hosting this Sunday..
he said these are EXCELLENT!!
well I think so too but that is a REAL complement from him as usually his coment is ""it is ok"" on things I make when he comes over"
229800,105670,2006-11-25,5,Addictive and Wonderful!!! Great with tequila!
274212,105670,2006-11-30,5,My family fell in love with these little wonders.  I did not find them too spicy at all.  I did buy larger jalapenos.
246936,105670,2006-12-01,5,I make this every week! The only thing different I do is I grill them. I personally think these are to die for!
132383,105670,2006-12-19,5,"The absolute hit of our Christmas Party...I scaled the recipe back and I was so sorry that I did.  They went so fast.  I did add slightly to the recipe.  I added Adobo (my husband is Puerto Rican and we use that in everything) to the cream cheese and I also pimientos (drained well. As another reviewer stated, I mixed the cheddar in the cream cheese too.  It was FABULOUS.  Going to make them again this weekend! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
58989,105670,2006-12-19,5,Awesome!
57562,105670,2006-12-20,5,"Worth all the stars!  But my peppers seemed to all flatten not sure why...  i'll try it again .. even with the shape melted, they were devoured.  i did use cream cheese spread maybe thatss why?"
414615,105670,2006-12-27,5,Delicious!
140485,105670,2007-01-01,5,"These are soooo good!!! Surprisingly not hot and the flavours just work fabulously together.  Used a foil lined cookie sheet to make clean up easier, otherwise made exactly as directed.  My DS wants to mix some of the jalapeno seeds with the cream cheese to make them hotter, but I like them just the way they are."
229850,105670,2007-01-01,5,"These were very good, but I did have to bake them an additional 10 to get the bacon done enough. No big deal, could be my oven. But they went over very well. I would caution everyone again to use gloves when making these. I was too lazy and very busy, so I was out of them in the kitchen and didn't take time to go get any out of storage, and what did I do, I touch my eye even after I had washed my hands very well, there was still some of the heat under my fingernail I guess, but oh my, couldn't see for a while. And yes I do know better, so that's what I get!!!!!!! But the recipe is delicious."
76554,105670,2007-01-02,5,"These were great! I have served them on 2 different occasions and have gotten nothing but great reviews. I was making them with the non-spicy people in mind and removed all the membranes. Next time I will leave them so that there a bit more hot.

I mixed the cheeses together. I also added caramelized finely chopped onion.

I froze mine because I was making them for different events. Basically, I just took them out of the fridge about 10 minutes before popping them in the oven.

If you find it time consuming to warp them in bacon then you could possibly cut them bacon up, fry it and then add it to the cheeses. I might try this next time!"
350750,105670,2007-01-02,5,Yummo! My friends mother makes these without the cheddar and they are still tasty.
182624,105670,2007-01-07,5,"I wish I could give this recipe 50 stars!!  I absolutely LOVE these poppers!  I especially love how easy these are to make!  Many times I've tried an appetizer that turns out to be very cumbersome to put together, especially the ""stuffed"" kind, but these are super easy and look fantastic.  They've definitely got some spice to them (of course), but if you prefer less spice, just use bigger peppers, since they have more cream cheese to balance it out.  It worked out perfect for my husband and me, as I love super spicy and he likes a little less, so he took the bigger, less spicy peppers, and we were both happy.  I would also recommend lining your baking sheet with foil.  I made it the first time without, and last night made them again with it lined and the cleanup was much easier.  I could easily eat the entire batch myself!  These will definitely be something I will crave often.  Thanks for an awesome recipe, Stephanie!! UPDATE: I made this last night, but just wasn't in the mood to stuff the peppers, so I decided to make it in dip form!  Lo and behold, it worked!  I very coarsely chopped the peppers and roasted them for five minutes or so.  Fried the bacon on the stovetop (used turkey bacon and it tasted great, although nothing is ever quite the same as the real thing), then mixed it all together.  Baked in the oven at the same temp until hot and gooey, about ten minutes.  ATE IT WITH A SPOON, which just seemed so wrong, but it tasted exactly the same and had the same amounts of everything, so I did my best to get over my feeling like a pig!  I posted a pic.  Would be great with tortilla chips!"
262312,105670,2007-03-04,5,"These were so awesome, I'm speechless!  I added sliced green onion and mixed the cheddar with the rest as suggested by other reviewers.  Delish!  We like things really spicy so I did half japs and half serrano peppers!  Thanks for the awesome keeper!"
142335,105670,2007-03-06,5,WOW! Possibly the best appitizer EVER! I can't wait to make these again.
398487,105670,2007-03-07,5,OK...these were fabulous...but a few suggestions were made at my party.  First...parcook the bacon...15 minutes is not nearly enough time to get it a little crunchy.  Also...the cheese literally 'exploded' out of the pepper...so my friend suggested making little 'cheese' logs and freezing them and then stuffing them in the peppers and they may stay intact a little better.  So i will try that next time.  These definitely take more than 20 minutes prep...they were very time consuming...but absolutely worth it!  YUMMY!
340847,105670,2007-03-08,5,I make these all the time but I have what they call a jalapeno deseeder.  You just cut the ends off and then use this gadget and get the seeds out.  I don't have to cut them in half.  Stuff them with the cream cheese wrap with bacon and bake.  I cook at 350 degrees for about 30 min.  WONDERFUL!!!!!
454675,105670,2007-03-14,3,Well so so ....bacon  and cheese  is  allways  a good   mix  but  peppers  were soggy  and  no   spice more of  a  twang taste and i  used fresh ...and   for  the  time  and  efort  unless  i specifically had someone  requst this (very mild peppers flavor ) i  wouldnt do  it  again but because  of the  flavor of  bacon  and   cheese     3  stars
447123,105670,2007-03-16,5,Love Love Love these little treats!!! I found them to be just great. You can adjust the hottness of them by simply leaving more seeds in them. These poppers were very easy to make as well. One little change I made.......... I mixed the cheddar cheese with the cream cheese. Turned out great. Thanks for a new family favorite AZRoxy63!!!
165953,105670,2007-03-16,5,"This tasted amazing!  My husband is a Texan up here in Canada, so any chance I have to add spice to his life, I take it.  He requested that i put some of the seeds from the jalapenos in the cheeses, which I did.  They certainly had a bite, to me, although he said they could have had more!  
Also, I found that 1/2 slice of bacon to wrap didn't turn out quite right (hubby says bacon is longer in the states) so next time I'll use a full slice to keep them nice and wrapped.

Again, AMAZING recipe, they sort of melt in your mouth and taste divine!  Thank you so much!"
461156,105670,2007-03-21,5,so easy and yummy. Only change I made was to cook it longer since we like the bacon extra crispy!
31124,105670,2007-03-28,5,"I made this like suggested by one reviewer, into a dip. I baked the jalapenos in the oven for 14 minutes, then chopped and added to rest of the ingredients. (I also precooked the bacon until crispy.) Then I tossed all ingredients together in my kitchen aid mixer. Put it all in a casserole dish and warmed it for about 15 minutes at 350 until bubbly. It was divine! I took it to a baby shower and it was a hit! It is spicy, not for the faint of heart. But, if you like your salsa medium or hotter you will love it!"
125677,105670,2007-04-17,5,"What else is there to say? This was one of the best apps I have made. We could not get enough. I halved the recipe, but I was sorry I did. This is a keeper !!!!! Thank you !"
347822,105670,2007-05-29,4,"These were quick and very easy to make.  Instead of plain cheddar cheese, I added Sargento's mexican mix (4 types of cheese).  This round I popped them in the oven, next I want to try them on the grill!  Thank you for the posting."
37868,105670,2007-06-05,5,OH!! I enjoyed!! Nothing to change at all. It took me a bit longer to bake in the oven but still it was Great!!! I have a new word for anything way to good!! I call it NASTY GOOD!!! My taste buds are going crazy over the taste. Thank You for posting...Hugs
268058,105670,2007-06-11,5,Love these- we sprinkle steak seasoning on top- so good !
236170,105670,2007-06-12,5,Delicious! The cheese combines so wonderfully with the jalapeno so it's not too spicy. We halved the recipe since there is only two of us. They would be perfect to bring as an appetizer to a party!
317499,105670,2007-06-30,5,These are just great!! thanks
529538,105670,2007-07-03,5,"I made twice the amount for a party.  I couldn't keep up with the demand!

This recipe will get alot of use at our house."
81563,105670,2007-07-04,5,These were a HUGE hit - even the non-spicy eaters enjoyed them....can't wait to make them again!
261510,105670,2007-07-05,5,These were a huge hit for a July 4th bbq!  I may try a broiler pan for the next time so the grease can drain through.  Thanks for a great recipe!
304290,105670,2007-07-15,5,"These were great. I made them for our Halloween party this weekend. They were a huge hit! Thanks. It took me a little longer to get the bacon to cook...about 25 minutes total.

Made this again for a party.  This time I took the advice of some other posters.  I half cooked bacon before wrapping it around the peppers.  I also mixed in the cheddar with the cream cheese.  I sprinkled some salt and pepper on the peppers before adding the cheese mixture.  This was the best batch I have ever made!  The bacon was perfectly crispy and I didn't have to bake them any longer than the recipe called for, like I did last time.  Everyone loved them!  Thanks so much!  Oh, and I mostly made these the night before.  I did everything but the bacon the night before and they were just perfect.  So, that's always good when you can prep something the day before a party."
542193,105670,2007-07-21,5,My friend actually taught me how to make these. I use fat free cream cheese and turkey bacon. They are delicious! I'm going to try adding some lump crab meat to it. :)
837152,105670,2008-10-07,5,"We loved these!  Can't say much else that hasn't already been said, except try them!"
401723,105670,2007-07-26,5,"Thank you so much for posting, AZRoxy63 -- they helped me win the grand prize at an appetizer party this weekend!  They are *amazingly* delicious.  The only modification I made was to bake a touch longer (about 20 mins, to toast the cheese and crisp the bacon a bit more) and I added a sprinkle of kosher salt.  I probably cheated and super-stuffed the peppers with a lot of cream cheese because I didn't measure, but hey...I was playing to win. ;-)"
552963,105670,2007-08-05,5,I have made these twice in one week.  We love them.
286209,105670,2007-08-06,5,"These were fabulous!!! I cooked them a bit longer to get the bacon really crisp, these were a huge hit!!!! We were surprised that they weren't hot, will make these often!"
364422,105670,2007-08-08,5,I made these for a BBQ and everyone LOVED them.  It took me a lot longer than 10 minutes to prep and my fingers were BURNING all night afterwards so be cautious and wear gloves maybe!
521611,105670,2007-08-14,5,D'lish like a laser.  Like a hot bacon laser on the target of my appetite.  Must find a way to make the bacon cook long enough without the cheese melting out as much.
125640,105670,2007-08-17,4,These were very good. I lined my pan with tinfoil and sprayed the tinfoil with non-stick spray for easy serving and cleanup. The only real change I made was to use a full strip of center cut bacon on each popper which  was very tasty. I promised DH that next time I'll try this recipe with sections of green bell pepper as he doesn't do spicy. Thanks for sharing.
378624,105670,2007-08-24,3,"Until today, I've only had bacon a few times...and each time, it was dry and crunchy.  I just thought that whoever cooked it, over cooked it...and thought that bacon, if prepared well, would be tasty.  Well, I was craving jalapeno poppers and wanted it protein style.  Intrigued, I went out and bought my first package of bacon (2 pounds).  I started off by cutting some of the bacon in half and leaving some whole.  I knew it would shrink but I thought it would maybe just squeeze the jalapenos, making them rounder on the top.  Well, 450 degrees and 10 minutes later, I pull them out and the bacon IS cooked (AND it wasn't dry and crunchy...the outer layer of the bacon was a little crispy but still soft)...and it did shrink...squeezing the cream cheese  mixture up.  After trying the bacon itself, I realized that I don't really like bacon...and bacon was pretty much all I tasted.  But for those bacon-fans, I'm sure this would be just excellent!  I'm waiting for my husband (a bacon lover) to see how he likes them...the only thing is...he can't handle spicy stuff.  It's good for my diet so I'm going to eat what I made!  I also feel good about sticking to my diet while getting to eat the poppers that I craved! =)

OH, also, before I started assembling them, I put the jalapenos in salty boiling water for 2-3 minutes so that they would soften up.  I dried the excess water AND THEN added the cream cheese mixture.  Before even putting the bacon on, or cooking them, I ate one...and another...and then I decided to stop.  The jalapeno w/the cream cheese mixture alone was addictive.  But, the jalapenos were bland.  Wrapping it w/bacon helped."
514193,105670,2007-08-25,4,"Made these today for lunch!  Halved the recipe, and had 12 halves for each of us.

I didn't have much selection of jalepenos, and pretty much grabbed the last 12 at the store.  I don't know why, but some were very spicy (very few) and most were not.  That part was disappointing.  I would have LOVED the recipe had that not occured.  

I partially microwaved the bacon prior to wrapping, and ended up with about 1/4 of a bacon slice too much, per pepper half.  So I cut those bits off, and put the overlapping bits baking sheet side down.  I ran out of bacon, so I used those 1/4 pieces and just laid them on top of the jalepenos instead of wrapping.  

It's almost more of a pain to wrap them than it's worth, so I think next time, I'll cook some bacon, cut it into little chunks and mix right into the cream cheese/cheddar cheese mixture I stuffed the peppers with.  Then again...the stuffing might leak out a little.   I'll give it a try anyways. 

Thanks AZRoxy63!  I'll give 'em another try!"
170972,105670,2007-08-28,4,"i had to bake mine for much longer than 15 minutes, however, it was worth it!"
373495,105670,2007-10-03,5,"I made an appetizer dinner with #86644 and  #43908.  I used turkey bacon  and light cream cheese.  I wrapped the bacon around the short side of the pepper, but looking at the picture, longwise would be better.  Yummy recipe!"
400420,105670,2007-10-05,5,"These are the best! They have become my favorite appetizer for parties!  I've made them at least a dozen times in the last 10 months :-)  I've started dicing the bacon and pre-cooking it, then mixing the bacon bits in a bowl with the cream and cheddar cheeses.  It saves a little time and (if possible) they taste even better, because you get bacon in every bite and they are much less greasy this way.  My MIL even asked for these for her mother's day gift.  Thank you so much!  This is my favorite Zaar recipe!"
288146,105670,2007-10-09,5,Yum!  These are awesome!  I mixed the cream cheese and cheddar together before stuffing and they worked perfectly.  A friend of mine had made these for a party a while back and she added green onion to the mixture and they were fantastic.  I think I prefer them with the addition of the green onion although they are certainly awesome without!
285687,105670,2007-10-14,5,What else is there to say. These are out of this world. The store crap is nothing compared to these. Thank you so much AZRoxy63
377039,105670,2007-10-20,5,"Using tips from other reviewers, I partially precooked the bacon for a minute in the microwave, and also softened the cream cheese and mixed the cheddar into it.  I mixed some seeds into half, and left the other half mild.  Otherwise I followed this as written.

It is outstanding. Delicious, mild (though adding seeds to filling kicked it up nicely too), and just perfect.  The prep time was just about right, too -- I just used a teaspoon and scooped out the seeds, so prepping the peppers didn't take long at all.  However, I made only a small batch, since there are only two of us -- I wish I'd made more!  I'll make this again and again.

**update** This has become a family favorite. I've made it again and again and it's always delicious. I've tried freezing after cooking, to reheat individually later; it's okay but the texture is totally lost. Best served fresh! Thanks again for an outstanding recipe!"
118268,105670,2008-10-08,5,These are absolutely phenomenal!  I will be making them many many more times.  I have already taking them to two BBQ's.  Thanks for sharing!
293971,105670,2007-10-21,5,"I msde 24 of these last night for 6 of us (and I don't eat meat) and they were GONE and the overwhelming HIT of the party.  I can't recommend these highly enough!  My friend took one bite and looked at his wife and said ""you need to get this recipe"". Also, these were easy AND cheap to make! What a bonus!  Probably lrss than 8 bucks for 24 appetizers!  (I made half the recipe) and not a morsel left! THANK YOU FOR POSTING and a special thanks from Pablo too ;)"
222096,105670,2007-10-27,5,"I halved the recipe (trial run before  Thanksgiving holiday).  I zapped the bacon in the microwave for 2 minutes (next time I'll try 4).  I too mixed in the seeds of about 6 peppers into the cream cheese and folded the shredded cheddar prior to placing them into the jalapeÃ±o shells. Then I placed the cream cheese filled peppers on top, in the middle of the bacon and folded ends on top.  No need for toothpicks.  Cooked in oven as directed, did need another 5 minutes for bacon to crisp up.  Test guinea pigs inhaled them in less than 5 minutes (that's less than 2 beers!).  I am now ready for Thanksgiving!"
419915,105670,2007-10-29,5,I hate jalapeÃ±o poppers - but I had these at a party and just about ate the whole plate.  I'm planning on making them for a party at my house next weekend.  You will not be disappointed in these.
292308,105670,2007-11-21,5,"YUMMY!  Even though I found room for improvement, these were good enough that I ate WAY more than was good for me.  I halved the recipe (to serve 4). I also mixed my cream cheese with the cheddar before stuffing, which worked great!  My only two suggestions:  find some way that ensures the bottoms get crispy (I tried baking them on a broiling rack, but it didn't really help).  That was my only ""ick"".  But still, I just picked the soggy bottom off and ate on. DH suggested grilling the peppers before and after stuffing (on the grill) to give the pepper a smoky ,  cooked flavor.  Sounds good to me.  LOVED IT! :)"
601700,105670,2007-12-03,5,"Made this yesterday as a snack, scaled down the proportions because it was just me eating, and I loved them. Cooked the bacon before, and added it into the cream cheese, with the cheddar and then put more bacon on top, and it was great. Will be definitely making them again and again and again........"
299685,105670,2007-12-07,5,Yum.  'Nuf said.
64702,105670,2007-12-16,5,I made these last night for my Christmas party and they were GONE. DEEEEEELICIOUS!
628785,105670,2007-12-17,5,Made for a girls night and they were devoured!  The jalepenos had to be pretty brown on the bottom before the bacon cooked and you want to be sure to get the jalepeno seeds out or your mouth will be on fire!  Thanks AZRoxy63!
232667,105670,2007-12-22,5,"Fantastic!  Next time I will follow another reviewer's suggestion and partially cook the bacon prior to wrapping, because some of the peppers burnt.  The easiest way to top with cheddar was to dip the cream-cheese-stuffed peppers in the grated cheddar.  These are delicious!"
286851,105670,2007-12-26,4,"I made these yesterday for a family Christmas get-together. Though a bit time-consuming to make, they were a big hit. I took other reviewers' advice and partially pre-cooked the bacon prior to wrapping. Even with this, they still took longer than 15 minutes to get the bacon to cook all the way, more like 20 minutes. However, with the pre-cooking, I had no problems with the peppers burning at all. Because I had thoroughly de-veined and de-seeded the jalapenos, the peppers were quite mild when cooked. They were very well-liked by everyone who tried them. Next time, I may make half of them ""hotter"" by leaving in a few seeds or a bit of the vein. Overall, a big success, and I will definitely be making them again. Thanks for sharing."
104929,105670,2007-12-29,5,I made these for my dad who is a jalepeno lover.  They turned out great.  Thanks.
701927,105670,2007-12-30,5,"Yummy!!  I made these for my family and they were a huge hit!  There were quite a few left over since there were only 3 of us, but they reheated wonderfully in the oven for a snack the next day.  I took someone's suggestion and 'rolled' the cream cheese filled pepper in the shredded cheddar as opposed to sprinkling it on top, doing it this way made wrapping the bacon around it much easier as the cheddar was somewhat 'stuck' in the cream cheese and didn't fall off when being wrapped. The only thing I will change next time is maybe leaving some of the seeds inside the pepper as we like super spicy!!  Delicious...thank you!!"
581409,105670,2007-12-30,5,THIS deserves a million stars.very easy -cooked bacon partially before wrapping.mixed a bit of cheese in with the cream cheese.My MIL even raved about how much she loved them and usually she never has anything nice to say.....My 9 year old loved them too.A real crowd pleaser. THANKYOU!!
593837,105670,2007-12-31,5,AWESOME!!  That's all that needs to be said.
218535,105670,2008-01-09,3,I baked it for 20 mins but my bacon still isn't crisp. It was good but not awesome.
345845,105670,2008-01-10,3,"These were good. However some were out of this world spicy even though I had done a thorough job at de-seeding the peppers. Not as fabulous as I expected, but still good."
258350,105670,2008-01-10,5,"I am so grateful to have found this recipe. I changed a bit thanks to reading some of the other reviews and added a twist of my own.I cut enough of the peppers lengthwise to form a small boat, leaving the stem on. I removed the seeds and membrane.I precooked the bacon half way and put to the side. I cooked some extra bacon all the way and mix it in the cream cheese as well as chopped up a few green onions and added a small amount of red pepper jelly, mixing it all together with the cream cheese. Putting the cream cheese mixture to the jalapeÃ±o boat. I then wrapped the half cooked bacon around the jalapeÃ±o and baked it in the oven until done. The sweet heat from the pepper jelly was a big hit. I layed the jalapeÃ±o boats on a bed of lettuce on a party tray. Looked beautiful and the lettuce help soak up any grease if any from the jalapeÃ±os."
894643,105670,2008-09-23,4,"These are really good. I made mine like the recipe, but then I wrapped them in cresent rolls before baking. They were a hit! Will be adding this recipe to our menu for football Sundays :) Thanks for the recipe!"
185926,105670,2008-01-26,4,"The directions are great.  I had trouble getting the bacon wrapped around the peppers, but my peppers were kinda big.  The adults enjoyed these.  Although I did remove the inside of the peppers some of them were still spicy.  I actually enjoyed the spicy ones more.  They do get greasy from bacon and cheese, lining the pans with foil will help with cleaning."
79751,105670,2008-01-31,5,"These are so good that my husband requests them for any event we go to, even if it's a formal dinner party.  He'll even help me make them!  That's saying something."
731567,105670,2008-02-07,5,I've made this recipe on numerous occassions and love it!! It's alos great done on the grill!
377581,105670,2008-02-07,5,Outstanding and addictive! I softened the cream cheese and mixed the cheddar into it. Super easy but impressive appetizer! Thank you for posting!
129314,105670,2008-03-06,5,"These are out of this world!  After trying these, I will never go back to those breaded deep-fried things again.  Thank you for sharing this easy, delicious recipe!!"
617031,105670,2008-03-08,5,"Wow, these are the best jalapeno poppers. My husband and I loved them. If you like HOT these are for you. I bet you could use milder peppers and they would be great for those who dont like too much fire. Great recipe."
160205,105670,2008-03-24,5,Wow...these are killer!  The only thing I think I'll do different next time is to use thin sliced bacon rather than thick cut.  Still came out great though!
373552,105670,2008-04-02,5,"I love these!  I took  advice of others and mixed the ingredients including cooking the bacon beforehand. I also cut the bacon in small pieces.  Then I  mixed everything together in a bowl after allowing the cream cheese to soften.  I also precooked the peppers ever-gently and cut them in half. I stuffed the peppers and cooked them in the oven.  They turned out great. I made tons for an upcoming party. I experimented with a small batch first to see if they would freeze and cook later, they cooked beautifully.  A great make ahead party appetizer--thanks for posting it."
536785,105670,2008-04-22,5,This was the only dish to completely run out at a barbecue I had this weekend. There was a ton of food and these lasted only a few minutes. I did mix the cheeses before stuffing the peppers. Thanks for a fantastic recipe I'll use again and again
128945,105670,2008-05-01,5,"What a wonderful recipe!!!  I was making these for a lot of people so I took the advice from one of the reviewers that said it was just as flavorful when all mixed together and created Popper Pizza Bites.  I mixed all up using canned chopped jalapeÃ±os en escabeche, coated English muffins and baked them.  I then refrigerated the rounds until firm enough to slice and cut into wedges and served at room temperature.  People raved.  Thanks  for letting me adapt your wonderful recipe.
Tony"
142364,105670,2008-05-03,5,"These are so good.  I did as others suggested and cooked the bacon about half way then just put a half slice on top.  I also combined the cream cheese and the shredded cheese.  Also, if you want them hotter, do not stuff too full with the cream cheese mixture and leave the seeds inside.  Please remember to wear gloves when taking the seeds out, I know better, but didn't do it and my hands burned for about 5 hours afterward...but these were worth it.....delicious and easy!  Thanks for posting."
497077,105670,2008-05-28,5,"These poppers are GREAT! I've made several times now-they are easy and fast to prepare-and this evening I made 6 just for DH and me-we love them! After reading the reviews, I did make some adjustments as follows: I mixed the cheeses together and one time used pepper jack cheese and one time I included cooked venison sausage bits; I used center cut bacon-not the thick cut and rendered the strips before wrapping; I lined my baking sheets w/ foil and cooked poppers on a rack so they aren't greasy. I gave my BIL the recipe and he makes his on the grill and both ways are delicious!!! Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
627420,105670,2008-06-01,5,I made these along with Recipe #265329 to bring to my friends graduation party last night and they both went over BIG!  I took the white part of the pepper and the seeds out to make them a little milder.  They were gobbled up in no time flat!  Thanks AZ!  Michelle
806997,105670,2008-06-25,5,very very good! I used both Jalapeno and chili peppers (for those that don't like a lot of heat). I've made them twice now and I'm making them to take to a July 4th party. Grilling them is definitely the way to go!
499050,105670,2008-07-18,5,Yum!
368594,105670,2008-07-19,5,Omg....yumm-oo
463126,105670,2008-08-19,5,"Can not add anything more that hasn't already been said..... fantastic appetizer! Made exactly as stated. Were gobbled up and gone in a flash. Wish I had made more. Easy to prepare. Made early in the morning and baked that night. I think you could even prepare them the day before and just cover well/refrig.   Lined baking sheet with foil for easier cleanup, though they stuck just a bit. Will use a touch of spray next time. Going to make them again next week for company. Yum!"
638072,105670,2008-08-31,5,"I had some trouble with these...my bacon was too thick and so I had to cook longer and ended up burning the bottoms.  BUT that being said my husband really liked these.
Im going to try a change next time...fix with cheese as recipe states, sprinkle with a little garlic salt and then take a small-ish piece of bacon and just lay it ontop (instead of wrapping...to cut down on the grease) then cook.
Im going to keep trying!  A yummy task!!"
349058,105670,2008-09-03,5,"I have made these twice and they are awesome. Second time I mixed together the cream cheese and cheddar.  Makes the process much easier.   This last time, I used 40 peppers so I ended up with 80 appetizers.  I had about 18 left on a tray that I did not cook.  I decided to freeze them--it worked perfectly.  When I cooked them a few days lated, they were just as good."
138051,105670,2008-09-19,0,"Good, but time consuming."
17803,105670,2008-11-01,5,"Yum! I left the stem on, so we could have a handle to hold onto while we ate them.  My favorite tool, a grapefruit spoon, was used to remove the seeds and membrane.  I found that if you angel the center of the bacon over the center top of the pepper that the ends can easily be tucked under the pepper and put on the baking sheet. Don't be afraid to stretch that bacon around the pepper.  These were not spicy hot at all.  I was surprised, even though I know the heat came from the seeds and membrane.   DH knowing these were  jalapenos, ate 2 of them after I had told him they were not hot.  He does not do spicy foods at all!   I'll be making these again, thank you so much for posting this recipe.  Made for *Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup 2008* game"
978517,105670,2008-11-08,5,I would give this recipe all of the stars I possibly could. I am CRAZY about this recipe. And you can change the amounts to make as many or as little as you would like. WONDERFUL!! Thanks for posting.
297076,105670,2008-11-23,5,"6/26/07 - These were perfect. Tom doesn't like cream cheese, so we used only cheddar, turned out great! Yum!
11/23/0 - Just wanted to update this. As you can tell by the photos, we've made these several times over the past year and a half. They are great little appetizers and really, anything wrapped in bacon is a winner!"
1031301,105670,2008-11-27,5,"These were delicious.  The only suggestion I would make is to go lighter on the cream cheese, and mix the cream cheese and the cheddar before putting them in the jalapeno.  We served them on a platter with the bacon wrapped dates and it was a really nice sweet and spicy and salty appetizer platter."
647965,105670,2008-11-29,5,"I made these twice over the Thanksgiving weekend.  OUTSTANDING!  Even people who dont like hot or spicy food even tried them and thought they were great!  I will be prepping these for a Football tailgate party this upcoming weekend also.  Throw them on the grill and cook em that way!  

Suggestions:   
1.)  Cut the bacon in half the length way and use that half to wrap one of your poppers.
2.) Alcohol prep pads...The oil in the peppers comes off your hands in seconds if you use these.  This makes it so you dont have to worry about putting your finger in your eye or whatever."
189475,105670,2008-12-01,5,"Wow, these were delicious!! They are better than the regular breaded poppers. One minor issue though...I think the 10 min prep is a very low estimate. It took me almost a half hour to make 20 poppers. Or maybe I'm just slow. Either way, it was no big deal because I had plenty of time but I wanted to mention it in case anyone else making this is in a hurry. I would have liked it if the jalapenos were spicier, but I guess the baking takes out most of the spice."
732026,105670,2008-12-09,5,"These poppers are wonderful. I did modify a little according to my family's preferences.  I mixed the cheddar sheese in with the cream cheese and I added one tablespoon of cajun spices to the cheese mixture.  Awesome !  Also, I lined my baking sheet with foil and then put the poppers on a greased/sprayed wire rack."
1071770,105670,2008-12-13,5,these poppers are great!! I made them for a party tonight and everybody love them.  Only thing is to spray some Pam on the baking sheet otherwise they get stuck.
341344,105670,2008-12-16,5,Made these for a potluck at work.  The guys couldn't leave them alone.  Very rave worth man-food.  Thanks!
472690,105670,2008-12-17,5,"Insanely delicious, made these for a party and they were a huge hit! I microwaved the bacon, chopped it and added it to the filling along with the sharp cheddar, same taste and saved a lot of work, especially considering that preparing all those jalapenos was pretty time consuming and tedious."
140132,105670,2008-12-18,5,I made these for the game and we all loved  them.  Even my daughter who doesnt' like HEAT loved these.  Thank you for the recipe to one of our favorite appies.
1090468,105670,2008-12-22,5,so quick and easy! and the taste is to die for!
1092376,105670,2008-12-23,5,Just a quickie suggestion on these FABULOUS poppers...I personally like my bacon on the crispy side and have found that microwaving your bacon for one minute on high to start the cooking process and then letting the bacon cool while you prep will make for a crispier popper after baking them...another tip is too raise them on a wire rack (not coated!) and put the rack on a foil lined sheet...gets the poppers out of excess grease and makes clean up much easier with the tin foil!  Can't say enough good about these...I leave seeds/veins in half my batches to make them spicy!  Try them...you will be hooked as will friends and family!
172277,105670,2008-12-24,5,Thank you for a great recipe!  I have been making these for a while and my family loves them.  Especially my sister she has requested them for our Christmas Eve party tonight!
483584,105670,2008-12-28,5,"My guests clobbered these puppies, they were fantastic!  The only thing I did different was to slice a small strip of pepper jack cheese for each pepper, instead of topping them with shredded cheese."
233638,105670,2008-12-31,5,so yummy!! I made a double batch of these and froze the extra. I cooked up one of the frozen batches yesterday and it stood up to the freezing well. My recommendation is to freeze them individually on a plate before putting them in big ziploc bag.
298070,105670,2009-01-01,5,Dee-licious! My new favorite appetizer!
180090,105670,2009-01-07,5,I didn't try these but my guests loved them and I actually should have made more because we ran out very quickly. I only made about 12. I used finely shredded Mexican blend cheese and mixed it into the cream cheese. I put a toothpick through to hold the bacon on. And baked for 20 minutes in a 375 degree oven then broiled on high for about 2 minutes to crisp up the bacon a little bit more. Be sure to use thin or regular bacon and not thick so the bacon can crisp up easily. Thank you for the recipe! I'll be making it again for more parties.
592657,105670,2009-01-11,5,"This is the second time that I have made these and this time I took the advice of others to mix the cheeses with cooked bacon (that did lessen the prep time) however, I didn't secure them together with a slice of bacon ... everything oozed out, but still rocked!! Thx 4 sharing :)"
195589,105670,2009-01-28,5,"Made a batch of these last weekend to preview before I make them for the Super Bowl. Yummmmmm! These are SO good, they will be my go-to recipe for poppers! I went thru lots of the previous reviews & these are the tips I used:
Lined baking sheet with foil and sprayed the foil with oil. Softened the cream cheese and added the cheddar to it. Used a grapefruit spoon to remove the seeds and membranes from the peppers. And, best of all, they freeze well! Thanks all for the great advice and thank you VERY much for posting AZRoxy63!"
597902,105670,2009-02-01,5,Made these for a party.  They never even made it out of the kitchen and onto the serving plate for the party.  Big hit.
355637,105670,2009-02-01,4,Made for the Super Bowl.... didn't last long!
1114014,105670,2009-02-07,5,"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! 
So glad that you can do these in the oven, rather than on a grill.

Thanks!"
1037272,105670,2009-02-08,5,"FABULOUS!!!!! It is a mistake to only make half of the batch, as I did. I made these for a group of 5 guys along with Mini Pigs-in-a-Blanket (recipe #79715), who were watching the UFC fight. Within 10 minutes of arriving at the party, all of the appetizers were gone! 
Also, prep time says 10 minutes, but it took me much longer to scoop, fill, and wrap. In the cream cheese mixture I added a little more shredded cheese. I used the Wrights THICK bacon, cut into 1/3's instead of cut in 1/2. I did not need to precook the bacon. These turned out great! I will be making these many more times!"
167527,105670,2009-04-03,5,Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!  I made these last night because I am on a low carb diet and was craving the breaded ones.  These were exactly what I was looking for.  Absolutely delicious.
1141377,105670,2009-04-25,5,I really liked this recipe.  It was very simple to make.  The only thing I think I'm going to do differently next time is not add the bacon on it.  The bacon made it even more rich than it already was.  But the filling for this recipe is GREAT!  Thanks for sharing!!
945233,105670,2009-04-29,5,"I added some green onion to the cream cheese and a little garlic powder.  They were very good, and my guests and I enjoyed them till they were gone!"
318028,105670,2009-05-03,5,"I made this recipe exactly as stated, and it was wonderful! I would have liked a little more ""heat"" to it, so next time I may add some cayenne pepper to the cream cheese, or just sprinkle it on top. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
442070,105670,2009-05-19,5,"Very lovely!  I made 1/2 the recipe as directed except  without the bacon (for vegetarian daughter) and the other 1/2, I crisply cooked and crumbled bacon into the cheese mixture with green onion, as well as wrapping in bacon.  I really did not notice much difference for all the extra effort.  They were both sooo good!  They are milder if cooked longer for sure and I recommend using rubber gloves when working with the peppers.... especially if you are a contact lens wearer.  That spice can last a very long time on your skin and be transferred to your eye .  Thank you for a really tasty appy!"
316098,105670,2009-06-04,5,"I brought these appetizers to a party and made everyone happy.  Here is the system I used to stuff:  After cutting off the stem, I used a very small melon baller to remove the seeds--worked great.  Then I used the tip of a small knife to fill the jalapeno boats.  I made a pile of shredded cheddar and pressed the cream cheese side of the jalapeno into it--the cheese adhered well.   I started on the bottom of the jalapeno when I wrapped the bacon, stretching it around the jalapeno several times, trying to end the wrap on the bottom, too.  If the bacon ended on the bottom, I didn't bother with any toothpicks,  if it didn't end up on the bottom, I secured with a toothpick.  Baking on a rack ensures that the bottoms are crispy, too.   Great recipe.  Takes a little time to put together, but well worth it."
183524,105670,2009-06-06,5,I have made these twice now and can say that they are outstanding. The trick is to scrape the inside of the peppers pretty well or else they will be too hot. I cook them for longer than the recipe states because I like the bacon very crispy. I am planning to make a trayful for christmas and take them to a family with teenagers who can bake them and enjoy as they wish.
893586,105670,2009-06-09,5,"I made these for a family vacation weekend in a cabin.  The oven had to be at least 20 years old! LOL  Anyway, these were a huge hit, everyone loved them, even my sister who had to wash her mouth out with water for 10 minutes straight (what a wuss!).  They were supposed to be a course for dinner, but somehow became an appetizer after someone spotted them on the table.  Easy to make once you get the seeds out.  Don't forget to refrain from touching anything else before washing your hands (unlike my fiancee who used the restroom without washing his hands beforehand, hahahaha, best part of the weekend)  He agrees that you should not leave the bacon out for any reason."
215083,105670,2009-06-13,5,"Just excellent!  As always though the prep time was very understated.  It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to seed and stuff 25 fresh jalepenos!  

Very addictive and I am incredibly sorry I looked at the nutrition information here.  LOL"
956686,105670,2009-07-04,5,"This is worth 10 stars!  I put everything in the food processor to make it into a dip...I don't think it will last until tomorrow.  We have 12 jalapeno plants in the garden, and now a really good way to use a few of them.  Great flavor, even for a Wisconsin girl like me.  Not really hot just really good.  I also added a red pepper, and a small onion.  I have used only 1 pkg. of bacon, and haven't added the cheese yet...I would tell my best friends to make this."
577826,105670,2009-07-26,5,"I can't believe I haven't rated this yet! We have been making these WONDERFUL poppers for 2 years now. DH and I don't like cream cheese, so I stuffed them with chunks of cheddar instead. That's the only thing I did differently. These are amazing!!"
1348987,105670,2009-08-11,0,"I cannot believe how wonderful this recipe is! Make them with the smaller jalapenos so that you can just pop one in for a mouthful of delicious goodness! Thank you so much, AZRoxy for this recipe!"
199020,105670,2009-08-17,5,"These were great! I couldn't believe how mild the peppers were after baking them. My eyes and throat were burning just cutting them, so I was afraid they'd be too hot to eat. After 15 minutes in the oven, though, they were actually almost sweet. I wish I had some bacon to wrap them with...maybe next time!"
1279990,105670,2009-08-20,5,OMG - awesome!!!!!!  Something I did to soften the peppers is pre bake them for about five minutes.  I made several versions and sitcking to the origional recipe is best - however I did leave out the bacon- it overpowered the other flavors!
629388,105670,2009-08-21,5,Jackpot!!! These are simple to do and taste great.  Wear gloves especially if you wear contacts.
944684,105670,2009-08-22,5,these thing are great!!! thank you!
1324122,105670,2009-09-17,5,These are awesome and so easy to make.  I have experimented with baking temps and times and I got the best results using the broil setting.  I also found that using very thinly sliced bacon or even gently pulling on the ends of the bacon strips to stretch and thin the bacon helps it to cook towards the more crispy side.  I tried slightly precooking the bacon before wrapping but they just didn't seem to be quite as good.
1198257,105670,2009-09-21,5,These are great-I soaked the toothpicks and grilled the poppers - you have to keep an eye out so you don't lose all the cheese but it worked out well!
844554,105670,2009-09-30,5,"I've been making these for years. I use parchment paper, cook turkey bacon for 30 seconds in microwave and stretch the bacon so make it easier to stick a toothpick in. Love these!"
1197229,105670,2009-10-18,5,"A hit at a baby shower (the mom-to-be was craving bacon). I did 25 with pork bacon and 25 with turkey bacon. Used one of the review suggestions to heat the turkey a little (1 minute) in the microwave to stretch them out a little. Another reviewer tip to start wrapping over the top of the pepper, to hold the cheese in. Suggest doing both of these. Great peppers. Will make this again. Thanks!"
289292,105670,2009-10-18,5,Everyone loved them!
377070,105670,2009-10-25,5,"This is a very easy recipe that presents well and has everyone raving. I found the smaller peppers (no more than a 1/2 inch to 5/8 inch in diameter) stay wrapped by the bacon better while cooking. Don't know if it's just my oven but found I had to put the broiler on for a couple minutes after the 15 minutes of cooking to crispy up the bacon.
Update Oct 2009:  I've been making these regularly since discovering this recipe.  Just wanted to share that now I usually omit the cheddar cheese and just add a 1/2 to 1 tsp of garlic salt to the creamcheese.  Still a party favourite!"
1443141,105670,2009-11-10,5,these are wonderful!  i tweaked the recipe a bit by adding a bit of garlic powder and i also mixed the cheeses together.  these are sooo tasty!!!  i am planning on serving them at my annual holiday party.  even my hubby who does not like jalapeÃ±os enjoyed these!!!
64642,105670,2009-12-13,5,The family just loved them!  Very easy to make.  Followed the recipe as written.
686917,105670,2009-12-17,5,"My wonderful husband adores these, and apparently so does his office. This will be the third Christmas party in a row that they have specifically requested them. Although this year, I'm going to remember to wear gloves while I assemble them. Last year, I made 4 dozen of them, and got jalapeno oil burned hands, couldn't sleep. Just a little suggestion :)

I make these with turkey bacon, which is very thin, less fatty and tastes very good."
1265522,105670,2009-12-25,5,Very simple and deliciuos . We enjoyed these as chrismas appetizers.
165136,105670,2009-12-26,5,I made these for my open house Christmas eve and they were inhaled!  I could have made 3 times as many poppers and I still would have had none left.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Fantastic!
663997,105670,2009-12-26,5,This took poppers to a whole new level.
1060485,105670,2009-12-30,5,i could have aten these all night! :)
782307,105670,2010-01-04,5,"These were the hit of the party - apparently!! They disappeared very fast. So yummy I think I will be expected to bring them everywhere I go!
I added the cheddar (I used Nacho blend for a bit more spice) in with the cream cheese. The mixture of cheese was way too much for the peppers but since peppers are such different sizes. I could have filled at least 12-15 more peppers with the extra bacon and cheese.
Definitely will make again and again. I would not mix the bacon in with the cheesd, by wrapping it you seal in flavor and cooks perfectly."
1435538,105670,2010-01-23,4,"These were pretty good!  Only wrong thing I did was not let them settle on paper towels first to let some grease off them.... otherwise, I will totally make them again!"
1547025,105670,2010-02-10,5,"These are so horrible for you, and you can feel it. They can get a little messy, so it's best to use the smaller jalapenos. Make sure that if you're making all 50 of them, you're actually going to be around a large group of people, otherwise they will sit there and tempt you and you will resent them later. Also, be sure not to rub your face while preparing the jalapenos."
1360249,105670,2010-02-14,5,These were the best!!
544765,105670,2010-02-20,5,This was a hit with the whole family.  My son is begging me to make these again soon.
1523091,105670,2010-02-28,5,Oh my! These were delicious! They weren't difficult at all and the taste was phenomenal. Definitely a keeper. Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!
242809,105670,2010-03-02,4,"The taste of these were really good, BUT, I couldn't get the bacon to get crisp up enough without the filling melting and oozing out! I would have liked more of the bacon fat to render out. Next time, I think I'll just bake them without the bacon, but chop up and pan fry the bacon on it's own, then sprinkle it on top after the peppers bake, OR just cook up the chopped bacon and mix it into the cream cheese mix."
43413,105670,2010-03-06,5,"Very good. I found that if you partially cooked the bacon first, they came out a little crisper."
1582712,105670,2010-03-22,5,i made these tonight and i cooked them on the grill i cooked them for about 10 min and let the bacon get alittle crispy i didnt put cheese on them but i added alittle seasoning to them and they were amazing i cooked them on the top shelf to give the bacon time to cook with out burning the jalapono i also cut them in half and put the cheese side down first and then turned the over i made sure not to cook them to long so you still get the freshness of the jalopeno this will for sure be one my next part plater
426156,105670,2010-03-30,5,"I tried these on a group of 20 people as a test for a larger party, and they were the favorite recipe of the 9 things I served. They really are good, and the bacon-lovers in the crowd were blown away! I did have to raise the oven to 475 to get the bacon crisp enough. Next time I'll either precook the bacon a little or start them out at the higher temperature. Thanks for a recipe that is wonderful, easy and different.
March, 2010:  I served these for the third time and they are consistently a hit.  Precooking the bacon about halfway really is essential.  They can be made at least one day in advance and held in the fridge, which I consider a big plus.  If anyone is afraid the peppers will be too spicy, fear not.  The cream cheese seems to calm the peppers and even people who don't care much for spicy foods often like these!   KK"
1378641,105670,2010-04-01,5,"They're called Armadillo Eggs in TX.  They're good baked, as anything with bacon is good.  But try grilling these over charcoal or wood with a nice thick sirloin, a baked tater, and a cold beer.  Taste so good makes you want to slap yo momma."
147095,105670,2010-04-05,5,"Like you need another 5 star rating.... hahaha! Suffice it to say, everyone has been correct on this recipe. DEFINITELY set aside more time for prep on this one; 30 min. does not cut it. DO follow other reviewers directions; for instance: DO pre-cook the bacon halfway, as it will not crisp properly in the allotted cooking time otherwise. DO add chives or green onions to the cream cheese; it makes a difference! DO mix the cream cheese and cheddar, as the cheddar will melt out otherwise and be gone. DO leave ribs/seeds in if you want any heat at all, as these were so mild my ""can't take the heat"" daddy scarfed up several with no problems whatsoever. DO cook on a rack as they will be swimming in bacon/cheese grease otherwise. Grilling sounds like a great idea; will try that next time.... possibly freezing little torpedoes of cream/cheddar cheese to stuff jalapenos with as it would most likely melt out otherwise. THESE ARE SOOOO WORTH IT!!!"
1492648,105670,2010-04-07,4,"I made these for my husband and not really for myself since I don't like japapenos, but the cream cheese really complemented the peppers and the bacon...well, who wouldn't eat practically anything wrapped in bacon? I did leave off the cheddar cheese on top and cooked them in a baking sheet but with a rack to drain the fat from the bacon so the peppers aren't sitting in them."
666682,105670,2010-04-11,5,"Yummy! The only thing I did differently was instead of shredding cheddar, I made long slices and placed it on top of the cream cheese so it wouldn't escape. I didn't precook the bacon or even place the poppers on a rack to cook, I just placed them straight on a lined baking sheet and it was great, the bacon grease just ran to the corner of the baking sheet. Next time I will leave some seeds/ribs on the jalapenos for more spice."
188848,105670,2010-05-09,5,"I decided for my first try I would make these exactly as written and they were a huge hit at the ""Ocho"" del Mayo party - a few days late to be called ""Cinco""! Next time I too will leave some seeds in as I like more heat. I've already decided that I will make these for our Board BBQ in June!"
325703,105670,2010-05-13,0,"I have been making this recipe for years- it is yummy! I mix my cream cheese and grated cheddar, and add some chopped green onions. I also blanch my jalapeno halves so they are not quite as spicy. They disappear at parties!"
932899,105670,2010-05-21,5,Amazing!
930656,105670,2010-06-10,5,"This is an excellent, simple recipe.  I omitted the cheddar cheese, as I am a popper purist.

That said, I had never made poppers myself, and am a pepper virgin.  I knew not to get the pepper juice near my eyes, yet did not know that if absentmindedly wiped along the upper lip, it burns like nobody's business!

Thirty minutes later, my face is  still all red (not sure how much is embarrassment, versus actual pepper carnage) but I got those suckers wrapped in the bacon and neatly toothpicked, the oven is preheating and I am excitedly awaiting my treat!"
1013299,105670,2010-06-15,5,"Great recipe!  I am on the South Beach diet and this was right up my alley.  Make sure and use thin bacon.  I used thick and had to cook it longer, plus thinner bacon would be crispier.  Thanks for posting!  Will be making this again Sunday afternoon for a party.  :)"
1024807,105670,2010-06-15,5,"this was excellent and easy.  How do you remove jalapeno seeds  without burning your eyes?  That was my only issue... My grandfather inlaw couldn't wait for me to take them out of the oven, he grabbed them off and ate them while they were still very hot, he didn't care.  excellent recipe, thank you!"
556011,105670,2010-06-21,5,"These were HOT but delicious.  I think I just got a hot batch of jalapenos because normally I don't find them to be very hot (and yes I got the seeds and membranes out).  These were still a hit...I didn't wrap raw bacon around them.  I had some bacon I had already cooked so I crumbled it up and stuffed it into the cream cheese before added the shredded cheese on top.  They were fabulous, easy and not greasy at all this way!"
592633,105670,2010-07-12,5,Ridiculously simple to make and so easy to stuff your face when they are ready!  We love them!
1254511,105670,2010-08-04,5,"I have been making these for years,except I dont add the shredded cheese.I also freeze these,then when it's winter I just pop them in the oven and cook.They are great to eat while watching college football!My family loves these!"
761650,105670,2010-08-09,5,"With an over abundance of jalapeno peppers in the garden this was the recipe I chose.  But, I did however modify the recipe a bit.  I used 15 peppers, 4oz cream cheese and about 1 cup of cheese.  I precooked my bacon and added it to the mix, crumbled.  I aslo minced the top of the peppers that I cut off and put them in with the cheese mixture and stuffed my peppers.  I only cut enough of the pepper off so that I was able to get the seeds and membrane out.  These were flavorful.  Thank you for a great base recipe."
566014,105670,2010-08-29,5,"I'm a wuss when it comes to anything even slightly spicey, but these were fantastic!!! They were very mild and almost sweet.  The bacon is what made the dish.  I brought these to a potluck and they were a huge hit with everyone.<br/><br/>After reading other reviews this is what I did.  I partially pre-cooked the bacon in the oven.  I added about 3 chopped green onions.  And, I softened the cream cheese and mixed in the cheddar.  It worked out very well.  I baked them on a cookie sheet with foil (no rack like others have said) and they turned out great.  One big suggestion...make sure you wear gloves when seeding the peppers!  I made the mistake of scooping then out by hand and it was a BIG MISTAKE!!! My hands were on fire for hours.  Overall, fantastic recipe."
1676706,105670,2010-09-03,0,I usually think that these comments are 'made up' but these comments are 'spot on' .  My co-workers LOVED THEM...as did I.  Give em a try.  You won't be sorry.
908620,105670,2010-11-01,5,My family loves these and have started making them frequently with fresh jalepenos from my garden.  I will try making and freezing as well for the winter months.
1734719,105670,2010-11-18,0,"Okay.. I fix something very similar to this when we are at the lake.. I halve the peppers, put shredded cheese or just a cube of sharp cheddar and real bacon bits.. cook them on a cookie sheet on the grill..sooo easy..."
636278,105670,2010-11-27,5,"My mom made these for me this weekend and we all loved them!  A few changes, she used pineapple cream cheese (makes it so yummy) and used turkey bacon.  This really cuts down on the grease and the bacon become more crispy."
1058163,105670,2010-12-20,5,"I've made this lots of times here's the best and fastest way. Cut the jalapenos long ways in half, save the seeds if you like spicey. Put the Jalapenos in the oven and cook til slightly browned. Meanwhile take a package of cooked bacon, crumble and put in skillet with the jalapeno seeds.Cook til the bacon makes its own grease, remove from heat to cool slightly. Take out the jalapenos from oven to cool. Mix cream cheese with bacon and seeds. Put cream mixture in jalapenos, use the fine shredded cheddar cheese to put over mixture, press slightly. Back in oven til cheese melts. enjoy!!!"
1617537,105670,2011-01-03,5,This was a big hit. (DON'T FORGET TO WEAR GLOVES)  Thank you and def. will be making it at my next get together.
294954,105670,2011-02-09,5,OMG!!  I just finished making this for my Wednesday Night Bunco group.  I just had to try it.  Very yummie!.  I cut the recipe in half and still have more than enough.  This is a recipe that will always come to mind for gatherings.  Oh..I did 1/2 recipe with turkey bacon and the other half with regular bacon.  I enjoyed them both.  But the regular bacon is more flavorable. Enjoy!!  :-)
1552815,105670,2011-02-09,0,i have made these several times now and they seem to get more delicious every time! i use a grapefruit spoon to take out the seeds and membrane. the spoon also works well for putting the cream cheese in the jalapeno. i do cook them longer than suggested to crisp the bacon...i will have to try precooking the bacon next time. love these!
292507,105670,2011-02-10,0,"Made these for the superbowl and they were a hit, even with the kids! I am making again in two weeks for a party but I think I will just a little bit of the seeds for a kick, thanks for sharing the recipe!!!"
1696504,105670,2011-04-11,0,Made these for my husbands b-day party.  THESE WERE FREAKING AWESOME!  They ate them so fast they were not even hungry for the main course!!!  Thank you for the recipe.  Making them again tonight
1650697,105670,2011-04-18,5,I made these for a family reunion thinking that there would be too much... there wasn't enough!! Everyone loved these so much. I will be making these again soon
1661670,105670,2011-06-02,5,These are absolutely amazing! UNBELIEVABLE!<br/>I made them for my husband during R&R and he was blown away. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!
57222,105670,2011-06-03,5,"Fantastic! We used pecorino cheese instead of cheddar as that's what we happened to have on hand, and grilled these as opposed to baking in the oven. Oh so very good!! Will get made often this summer. Thank you!"
1916257,105670,2011-06-18,5,"Made these tonight, for the first time. OMG they are freakin awesome.. Anoher addition to friday night appetizer menu. Attending happy hour @ a bar is a thing of the past these days. We have our very own happy hour 2x per month at home."
1937002,105670,2011-06-21,0,"Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Poppers<br/>Has anyone tried substituting Pineapple cream cheese for the regular cream cheese? You don't have to put the Cheddar cheese on them. Although, it would be yummy. Just halve the Jalapenos lengthwise, fill with the Pineapple Cream cheese & wrap with bacon. Bake @ 350 until bubbly and bacon is crisp."
1939782,105670,2011-06-24,3,good one
1788846,105670,2011-07-07,5,"This looks absolutely amazing.  I haven't tried them yet, but I can tell that the heat leaches into the bacon and the fat leaches into the peppers making them an amazing marriage.  The simplicity of the ingredients list also makes it a provocative dish because the bold flavors get to stand out!  I'm trying this tonight!"
1790933,105670,2011-07-09,5,"These are common in the grill forums, as ABTs.  Which stands for Atomic Bomb Turds.  We love these, but are significantly better on the grill.  The grill imparts grill marks and some smoke flavors."
1187404,105670,2011-07-12,5,"I've made these many times and they are fantastic!  You can make them as hot as you want by leaving more or less of the seeds and/or pith.  Wrapping the bacon around was annoying for me, so I now cut cooked bacon into thirds and place a piece on each popper.  It's still bacony goodness!  Love these - thank for posting!!"
1963542,105670,2011-07-22,0,It takes a little longer but well worth the effort.Do not cut the pepper in half and leave stem on peppers and slice one side so you can open it up and clean it out.  Mix 16 oz cream cheese 3.5 oz of sun dried tomatoes and chopped onion to your liking. Stuff peppers thoroughly and wrap with a whole piece of bacon and pin them with tooth picks. I cook them indirect on charcoal ( no flare ups ) until bacon is almost done and then finish them off on top rack of gas grill on low heat. This allows the pepper to cook more and become soft it's also a little more pleasant on the taste buds. I think they are even better the next day at room temp. I leave the stem on so you have something to hold while you eat them. I buy one pound of bacon for 15-20 poppers
82772,105670,2011-07-22,5,Ok these were amazing. The prep time is a little deceptive though as it took way longer. I took them to a potluck barbecue and worried because they were still very spicy. I had cleaned most of the seeds but left most of the membranes in the peppers. My concern didn't last long as they were immediately attacked. After they cooled we started putting them on the charcoal grill and heating them back up. Excellent idea as they were even better with a little smoky taste. Next time I'll be cooking them on the grill! I like the additions some of the reviewers have suggested and I will try some hot raspberry jelly. MMmmm!
1618552,105670,2011-08-06,5,"These are fantastic!! I cut them in half and leave them that way, I wrap each half in bacon. My husband and I love these. They are the perfect addition to a grilled steak meal!!"
1503876,105670,2011-08-22,5,It's ten times better if you add dry ranch mix to the cream cheese!!
818915,105670,2011-09-05,5,"Easy and delicious!  I also made some with maple syrup mixed into the cream cheese.  It sounds weird, but they were fantastic.  5 stars!"
284729,105670,2011-11-03,1,"It was really annoying to go by this recipes directions only to find the bacon (very thin sliced) is still raw after 20  minutes at suggested temperature.  Also to have both cheeses in a puddle around each jalapeno.  I should have looked at all the alterations folks did to these before I attempted to cook these without a backup plan in time given for a potluck.  What is with all the five star reviews?  Someone please tell me what I am missing other than going by the recipe.  Why not test your recipes before posting them, then most won't have to alter it!  Make your adjustments before posting the thing!  Thank you!"
2132867,105670,2012-01-03,5,"We have made these for cookouts for years.  We usually use homegrown jalapenos and put them on the grill! So good!!   The seeds are what really creates the heat, so remove them AND RINSE if you can't stand spice and they will only be a mild flavor.  If you like heat, you can leave a few of the seeds.  I like to mix my cheese and if you do cook them in the oven make sure that you use a rack so that they are not swimming in grease.  Like some have said, these do take a few minutes to prepare, so allot for that.  You have to scrape all of them out.  Also, the seeds burn my hands afterwords, and it's definitely not good if you rub your eyes, so I tend to use a pair of gloves when I am removing the seeds."
330312,105670,2012-02-01,0,"Ok, I've been making these for a long time. But with this recipe I can't think the cheese would stay in. Instead, use Queso fresco cheese. you can get it in a lot of grocery stores, but may have to go to a hispanic grocery. It is a crumbly cheese, easy to work with, and softens nicely when hot, but won't leak out. You might want to chop up some andouille and mix it with the cheese. Also, I leave the stems on. These things need a handle. Don't cut completely in half, just down one side. Take out the seeds or leave some, depending on how much heat you want. Put the toothpick in to hold it together and then wrap the bacon around it. Cook in the oven using a broiler pan or a rack to let the grease drain, or cook on the grill(my preference). No need to precook the bacon. Just give it enough time in the oven to cook. You will need to turn them once."
2170257,105670,2012-02-02,5,I followed the suggestions and they were a big hit at my cooking club. I also added some garlic to the cream cheese. Very easy to make too! Would be great for the superbowl party!
383346,105670,2012-02-29,5,Yummy!  Simple but so good.  The only thing I didn't like was the bacon to sizzle in the oven.  But the taste is amazing.  Thanks AZRoxy :)  Made for All you can cook buffet
369715,105670,2012-03-01,4,"My husband made these. As written he thought they were a bit bland but to the next batch he added some spices to the cheese mixture. He used season salt, garlic powder and pepper. They enjoyed them."
1171921,105670,2012-03-30,5,"A great recipe but as everyone else has said this takes much longer than 20 min, took me more like 90 min star to finish. I modified the recipe to make them more bite size by cutting in half after gutted and fill with cheeses, then wrap with a half slice of bacon. This worked fantastically for a work potluck. Highly recommend."
2243771,105670,2012-04-20,5,Don't know if anyone else has suggested this or not but the best thing I have found for the hands after seeding your peppers is to wash your hands with the juice of a fresh lemon or some ReaLemon brand juice right out of the bottle and then some Fast Orange brand hand cleaner if you have it or just regular soap and water. The lemon takes away all the burn and the soap or hand cleaner removes the strong lemon smell
2246103,105670,2012-04-22,4,"I liked this, but I will be looking for tips to prevent the cheese from running out.  I did add the cheddar to the cream cheese instead of sprinkling on the outside, and I also followed suggestions in some reviews to add chives and I think that was a great touch.  This didn't have a big kick to it so I could convince more family members to try some!"
2297147,105670,2012-06-17,4,I have been making something like this for years using a chili grill on the BBQ but tried this recipe as a quick alternative when not starting the grill because of weather. I did experience the same problems other people mentioned about the cheese melting out but otherwise loved the result. Cooking the upright avoids the cheese running but I actually have a Texas Chili Grill for that. I also stuffed a couple with some leftover chorizo and cheese and may have found a new item for brunch.
406741,105670,2012-07-09,0,"I'm not going to assign stars to this because I never got to actually eat these - they were gone too quickly! I guess they were a hit ... <br/><br/>Followed the advice of others below and mixed the shredded cheese with the cream cheese and also chopped up some green onions for the mixture. Be careful not to overstuff the peppers because the cheese does ooze out while baking. Prep time was longer than stated above but still quite easy. I did each step at a time - cut/seeded all the jalapenos, then stuffed all the jalapenos, then wrapped all the jalapenos in bacon. Definitely try to wear gloves because manhandling jalapenos for 30 minutes will burn your skin."
1753859,105670,2012-08-09,4,"These are really really good, however a person should be advised about wearing rubber gloves when cutting the peppers and seeding them.  <br/><br/>I didn't and my hands burned for 2 days!!!!"
1330315,105670,2012-09-03,5,"Great recipe.  Following previous reviews, I made the following changes:<br/>Add 3 chopped green onions and some black pepper to the cheese mixture.  Put the cheddar cheese in with the cream cheese also.  There was no heat in my jalapenos so if you want heat add the seeds, crushed red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper to the cheese mixture.<br/><br/>Bacon:  Pre-cook in batches in paper towel lined pie plate in microwave for 2 minutes and cool.<br/><br/>Baking:  place filled and wrapped poppers on rack over foil lined sheet pan. Bake @ 350 for 10 minutes.  This gives the pepper some cooking time.  Raise temp to 450 and cook till bacon is crisp and cheese is bubbly and browned."
2371931,105670,2012-10-05,5,Yummy!!
107135,105670,2012-10-08,5,my son james loves these  he cooks them on the grill
497463,105670,2012-11-15,5,Amazing!
2529099,105670,2013-01-06,5,"OMG! These were amazing! Like a doofus I realized I'd forgotton the cheese after I had them all wrapped in bacon. So, I put the cheese on top of each immediately after taking them out of the oven and it melted perfectly. I had ideas popping like crazy in my head and just came in from discussing it with my hubby, who loooooves spicy. I love the other suggestions here, too. I'll play with it but here were some of my ideas: 1) Sam's Club has an awesome 3-alarm hobenero cheese. I think a thin slice at the bottom or on top would be good. Same idea for Pepper Jack. 2) Boursin cheeses are loaded with great flavors. 3) I'll make a mixture of cream cheese, fresh pureed garlic and chives. Often, when I want bacon flavor, I put cooked bacon in a food processor and turn it into a powder. I'll make a batch with cream cheese mixed with horseradish and bacon powder before I wrap them. The ideas are endless. I think vegetarians would like them with a spinach and roasted red pepper mixture! Can't wait for Super Bowl Sunday. ~Char."
2486013,105670,2013-01-22,5,Absolutely delicious!
178742,105670,2013-02-12,5,"We LOVED it! The only thing I did differently was halved by bacon then cooked it some, and placed on top of the cheeses instead of wrapping it! Picture submitted! Thanks for sharing!"
314211,105670,2013-06-06,5,These are not as good as previous reviewers have suggested...they are better!!! Everyone loved them!  I did soften the cream cheese and stir in cheddar just to make it a bit easier.  I will precook the bacon a bit next time....and yes there will be a next time!
738454,105670,2013-06-23,5,"I did modify a bit--I mixed all together:  8oz reduced fat cream cheese, 1 cup reduced fat grated sharp cheddar, 3 green onions thinly sliced and 1 pkg fully cooked bacon (micro cooked so can crumble).  I bought 20 jalapenos and it filled all of them. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes.  It was easy, fairly clean and a little bit better for you!  Also, a grapefruit spoon works wonderfully to pull out the seeds/ribs. I calculated the calories using my ingredients as 31 calories per piece (I had 40 pieces)."
198154,105670,2013-08-08,3,"I guess I should have read the reviews before I made these.  The cheddar melted off the popper, the bacon didn&#039;t crisp properly and the cream cheese needed something to add to the flavor.  Luckily we have lots of jalapenos in the garden.  So I will make these again using the suggestions in Raquel Grinnell&#039;s review. I will update review when I do.  I think this could be a great recipe with some tweaking."
2858776,105670,2013-08-19,0,"I had a friend make these...she added a bit of low sodium soy sauce, and it brought out the smoky flavor of the pepper and bacon. If you haven&#039;t tried with a bit of soy sauce, you should! Delicious."
2074896,105670,2013-09-08,5,These are AMAZING.  Best thing I&#039;ve cooked in a while.  Perfect day for them...1st football Sunday of the year!  I cooked at 375 degrees for about 30 min and then set it to broil on high for about 3 minutes and they were cooked absolutely perfect!  This recipe made so much I actually put half in the freezer...we will see how they turn out after being frozen.  I didn&#039;t think my husband and I would be able to eat the other half but we did!  Even my 2 year old liked them!  So yummy!!!
951133,105670,2013-10-02,0,LOVE THESE!!!   I made this as written the first time and the next time instead of bacon I used sliced deli ham and left out the cheddar and they were just wonderful that way too!  Thanks from this low carber:)
1742738,105670,2014-01-04,5,used pineapple cream cheese and 2 tbl of red pepper jelly mixed w/ cream cheese and they were outstanding.  Microwaved bacon 70 sec prior to putting in oven.
305531,105670,2014-04-26,5,Yum! These are so good. My grandson loves to make these for us to snack on. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper. Made for Name That Ingredient Tag.
2738985,105670,2014-07-15,5,These are my favorite to put on the grill!!! In fact I make them everytime we grill.  I also add a little garlic salt in the cream cheese mixture.  Sometimes I get a little devious and leave some seeds in the peppers.  This recipe is the best thing since kool aid!!
1803122398,105670,2014-09-10,0,"It take longer to make them than it does eat them, not fair!"
2000424680,105670,2015-08-23,5,Easy AND delish!  Super yummy and always a hit.
2001849880,105670,2017-12-10,5,"I always make these and everyone loves them. I have NEVER had any left. My great suggestion is using thin bacon , let it com to room temp and use a whole slice to wrap each jalapeno half. At room temp the bacon will stretch and you can wrap it so well that when it cooks and shrinks, it will wrap the jalapeno tighter and hold in the cheese perfect. i have some in the oven right now for a Vikings party."
465056,249761,2007-09-12,4,A good variation on that plain old v-8 :D  Thanks.
369715,249761,2007-12-29,4,I drink a lot of V8 so this was a nice change of pace. Made this as written. Will use again in the future. Thanks MsSally
568297,249761,2008-01-13,5,I like the other reviewers thought that this was a nice change to the plain V8 juice. Made as written. Thanks for posting! Made for 123 wonders game.
37449,249761,2008-02-07,4,This had a nice tang due to the vinegar. I liked all the flavors! Thanks Sally! Made for the Everyday is a Holiday game.
242729,249761,2008-03-04,5,"Totally delish and a real ""pick me up""..........only my batteries let me down, so no photo:-( SORRY! I also used a stick of celery as a stirrer, so I was annoyed not to get photos!  Loved the balsamic vinegar - that was a GREAT twist. Thanks MsSally - I will make this again. FT:-)"
209747,249761,2008-03-27,5,GREAT and healthy pick me up! This was terrific! I really enjoyed the tang from the balsamic vinegar and the hot sauce just sent it over the top for me! Thanks for getting me through the day! Made for Bev Tag!
428885,249761,2008-05-01,5,"I so totally love this ~ I think I will ""pick myself up"" everyday! So easy to throw together, and the vinegar as well as the hot sauce just made this even more outstanding. Being the *hot* pepper head that I am; I used *Spicy* V8 and still added  more the my fair share of Tabasco sauce. Donned it with a crisp asparagus spear, and presto, I was uplifted. Thank you so much, MsSally. Made for *Spring Spectacular* April 2008."
226863,249761,2008-12-02,5,"I definitely enjoyed this.  I used spicy hot V8, and also added some freshly ground black pepper.  I can see this developing into a great bloody mary mix!  Took this to work with me, so I have no photos.  Made for Every Day is A Holiday Tag!"
290107,249761,2008-12-09,5,"Mmmm! This is a very tasty & refreshing drink. I made it using low-sodium V8 (the others are all way too salty for me) and, as I was out of Tabasco (would've been my 1st choice), I used 3 dashes of Frank's hot sauce. It was not at all zippy, so I'll probably add more next time. I went light on the garlic, as I was making this for breakfast and didn't want to overwhelm everyone with garlic breath! The sweetness of the balsamic vinegar added a very pleasant note to the flavor, and was very complimentary to the saltiness of the vegetable juice. Thanks so much for posting, MsSally!"
383346,249761,2008-12-13,5,"This is so good.  I've made it yesterday and today.  I'm going to do this often and will bring to work also.  It's great.  Even if I used a V8 that was plenty of sodium.  Next time, I'll buy with less sodium, cause the balsamic and tabasco add a lot of taste (I didn't use garlic powder)  Thanks MsSally.  Made for Holiday tag."
37449,214992,2007-04-01,5,"This made a yummy lunch! I used an English muffin, toasted. I chose not to heat the egg salad and avocado. Yum! Thank you Karen!"
121690,214992,2007-04-10,5,"I used an English muffin and added in a leftover small chopped scallion. I did use Kraft light mayo in place of regular (I hate fat-free mayo but honestly can't tell the difference between low-fat and regular). This was very good--I especially liked the melted mozzarella cheese, which I wouldn't have thought to put with egg salad."
359936,214992,2007-07-10,4,"Nice, simple sandwich. I made this for my DD and myself for lunch today. However, she skipped the avocados and had American cheese. We ate ours on a Hoagie sandwich roll, and not open-face. 3 eggs and about 1.5 tbsp mayo between us. My mozzarella seemed off, so I used Quattro fromagio instead (4 cheese blend with mozza, fontina, parm, and asagio). It was very nice. Quick and easy lunch. I haven't had avo with egg salad in years. Thanks for the reminder!"
80353,214992,2007-10-28,4,Very good and dead-easy to make.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the hamburger bun - just not enough substance to hold up to a tasty sandwich.  I think the English muffin (or even a bagel) would be a much better way to go.
373817,214992,2008-08-04,5,This was so good. I made it for breakfast! I used only one egg (since it's just me) and I made it on toast. I can see myself making this several times a week! :)
286566,214992,2009-12-08,5,"Thank you for giving the DM and I a great lunch.  I doubled the recipe but only used about 1 1/2 tablespoon of mayo for the 4 eggs but nearly 3/4 of an avocado and 6 to 8 tablespoons of pregrated light mozzarella.  Thank you Karen67, made for Potluck Tag game."
128473,214992,2016-11-07,5,"I have an abundance of avocados, so I went looking for a recipe to enjoy them with....What a lovely treat this was. I enjoyed this for breakfast today, so glad that I tried it. Wow, what flavor and textures, it was excellent. Quick and really easy to make, also very easy to vary. Made as written; using sourdough baguette and marbled cheddar. Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will enjoy often."
35106,36060,2003-01-22,5,Delicious! The bananas really give off a great flavor to the pudding! I used whole wheat bread to make it healthier...kinda. =)
82567,36060,2004-01-17,3,This was a little bland..I like mine sweeter tasting so perhaps add 1 c. sugar instead..the sauce was wonderful though! I added a little bit a sugar to the pudding before putting on the sauce to sweeten it up a bit.
49542,36060,2005-04-28,5,I'm not fond of bread puddings but made this for guests and it was great.  The pudding itself isn't overly sweet but the sauce gives it the sweetness it needs.  Served with vanilla ice cream and it was delicious.  Might try it with hot fudge in addition to the vanilla sauce and ice cream -kinda a Banana Split Bread Pudding!
199839,36060,2007-03-11,3,Ths sauce is great but my pudding didn't turn out.... plan on trying again... I fogot the butter.....
248640,36060,2008-03-02,5,This was fantastic.  I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup as my husband likes it sweeter.  It was delicious!  We will definitely make this again!  Thanks!
425105,36060,2008-11-04,3,"I was really excited about this one, but felt it fell short in my opinion. I love bread pudding and thought the addition of banana would be great. Instead, I found that the banana pieces that ended up on the top of the dish got brown, and there wasn't enough flavor. Maybe it needs more vanilla or heavy cream. I did use a mixture of skim milk and some half & half that I wanted to use up, and I skipped the sauce (I never eat sauce on my bread pudding). It is probably better with the sauce, but for me to give bread pudding a top review, it needs to be able to stand on its own."
2672126,36060,2013-03-30,5,"I threw this together as a treat for some last-minute guests.  Simple ingredients, divine results!  I had to sub some almond milk for part of the milk, and I&#039;d say to be careful with adding extra sugar.  I did, and next time I will stick to the recipe to suit my tastes."
461834,468194,2012-03-04,5,Great sauce!!!  I decided to use cheddar for the cheese and made this a bacon penne and cheese lunch.  I made 1/2 of the sauce but still used the full amount of bacon and I did at least double the amount of cheese in order to get enough flavor from it.  It didn't say what or when to use the bacon so I just added it right before serving so the bacon still had some crunch.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for PRMR Tag Game.
174096,468194,2012-07-21,5,Very nice flavorful sauce!  I used cheddar cheese.  It made a generous amount of sauce too.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT8
212609,468194,2012-05-09,0,"I took a leaf out of diner's book and added extra cheese, and extra bacon.<br/>Tossed into some macaroni...delicious. Next time I will add a few thinly sliced saute leeks too.<br/>Thanks.Made for PRMR."
323186,468194,2012-07-25,5,"Very simple and very good!!   I made this to go with penne for a decadent mac 'n'cheese, I used Parmesan for the cheese, and I must say, with the bacon and parmesan, no extra salt is required.   Delicious, thanks for sharing, Dienia, definitely a make-again :)<br/><br/>Made for ZWT 8"
526666,447174,2011-07-21,5,"These were lovely! I halved the recipe, using 1 banana, and got 10 wontons. They were quick and easy, and push a bowl of vanilla ice cream over the top. I also really enjoyed how the bananas were all melt-y inside the wrapper. Wonderful! Thanks for sharing, duonyte, and for expanding my wonton repertoire!"
465056,447174,2011-07-24,5,"These were fabulous!  I tried plain banana, with cinnamon, with butterscotch chips, with strawberries and strawberries without banana.  They were all good.  the best was plain banana and banana with butterscotch.  I think they would be great with fondue.  :D"
2597942,447174,2013-05-03,5,"This recipe was so much fun to play around with. I decided to make this because it reminded me of what my mom use to serve my siblings and I for breakfast while growing up (sliced bananas in a bowl of milk with sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top). I always have a sugar/cinnamon Tupperware container in the cabinet (we use it on toast quite often, so I make about a cup at a time and store it). I sliced the 1st banana and followed the instructions exactly. Fabulous! The other banana I decided to combine the thoughts of the other reviewers, and got somewhat creative! (Instructions said to try various ways, right?) I sliced the 2nd banana &#039;very thin&#039;. I also had leftover frozen, sliced strawberries that were already thawed and soaking in a simple syrup (that I had made for a different recipe). I grabbed a leftover, solid milk chocolate Easter bunny and grated him up. Took a handful of mini marshmallows and used a rolling pin to smash &#039;em kinda flat. (Can you see where I&#039;m going with this?) Here is what I did... I took the sliced banana and strawberries and coated them in the grated chocolate. In the center of each wonton wrapper, I place a chocolate coated banana slice, then a smooshed marshmallow, then the chocolate coated strawberry slice and closed them up! OMG... These would be terrific for a kids finger food! (I even got out my whipped cream to dip them in)! I had a WONDERFUL breakfast this morning!!! :) I love the original version with just the cinnamon/sugar (very tasty), but the 2nd batch was to die for! Thank you so much for posting this recipe. Definately making these again... with many variations! (Made for PRMR - Spring 2013)"
424680,392690,2009-11-05,5,"As many smoothies & shakes as I've made, I don't think I've ever considered including nuts, but in this one it definitely works! Will admit, too, that I used a frozen banana & also included a small scoop of protein powder (the latter being something I usually add to all my smoothies)! Thanks for opening my eyes to including nuts! [Tagged, made & reviewed in New Kids on the Block tag]"
1521004,392690,2010-01-13,4,"Delicious. I used strawberry-banana yogurt and strawberry-flavour soy milk, and am looking forward to more experimentation."
114027,392690,2011-09-02,5,"I made it exactly as the recipe states and this is one of my favorite shakes ever. I love the flavor the walnuts add and since there was no ice or frozen ingredients nothing melted, keeping the shake nice and thick the whole time I was drinking it. Made for I recommend tag game."
593927,392690,2011-12-06,5,So delicious. I used water in place of the milk but used Balkan (thick) yogurt.
404043,392690,2013-07-20,5,LOVE THIS! I added blueberries. Perfect combo!!! &lt;br/&gt;I just came in from doing chores on a steaming hot day. I threw this together in the blender and immediately perked up!&lt;br/&gt;Smooth with a bit of walnut texture Just the right amount. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing this!!!
80353,162549,2006-04-28,5,Asparagus is best served as simply as possible and this recipe really does it justice.  The topping is wonderful and really sets off the asparagus well.  A keeper.
297076,162549,2006-06-17,4,"We are big asparagus fans in our house and this was pretty good. We loved the flavor, but the double-cooking kind of made them a little overdone. We opted to steam them because we like them every so slightly crisp, but they still got a little overdone for our tastes. Next time, we'll steam them a little less before moving on to the other steps... great taste and our kids and guests loved it!"
282678,162549,2006-06-19,5,"Yum! I made 1/2 of the recipe, which would call for 3 1/2 T butter.  I used only 2 T and with the butter that is already in the prepared dish, it was plenty.  I loved how the cheese makes a crust.  It seals all the other ingredients onto the asparagus and doesn't just flavor it and then run off to the bottom of the dish. DS even liked them and that is a miracle in and of itself. He would never even try asparagus.  Served with Balsamic Roasted Onions and Potatoes Recipe #85719,  beef fillet with a peppercorn sauce.  Made a great Fathers Day Dinner.  Thanks KITTENCAL.
Another winner! 
"
204024,282709,2008-08-31,5,"Sweet, smooth, tangy, with just a little zip from the Tabasco sauce.  Very tasty!  Made for Oz swap 19."
163112,162549,2006-09-20,5,"I had really, really THIN asparagus, so I skipped the blanching part (we like crisp veggies anyway).  It came out perfectly.  Even THE PICKY ONE had 2nds!  I do recommend having the butter at room temp for easier blending.  ;)  Thanks, KITZ!!"
424680,282709,2010-02-08,5,"This might be a great sauce for the outdoor BBQ, but I find it's also very nice over the top of chicken breasts that baked in the oven! Definitely like the combo of apricot, orange & tomato, & I look forward to having it around during the warm summer months when I can, in fact, do some BBQing!

44757,101115,2004-10-03,0,"This is known as a ""Loco Moco"". It has been said that it originated on ""The Big Island"" in Hilo. You can find it almost anywhere in Hawaii, and is one of my favorite breakfast meals! You might also want to try a version that was served at a bar I used to work at in Manoa. Instead of brown gravy, they used chili, thus the ""Chili-Loco""!
"
39835,48972,2003-08-16,4,Delicious and makes a lot! Instead of tofu I added 1 cut up red bell pepper. I also used two kinds of enchilada sauce (mild red and medium green) which worked out very well for us. We served this with corn bread for a very filling vegetarian Mexican meal with enough left over for lunches during the week. The only problem I had with this recipe is that I wished can sizes were specified.
137336,48972,2005-04-29,5,"Delicious! This recipe has become a staple in our veg household. So yummy and easy! We half the recipe and use flour tortillas and mild enchilada sauce. The tofu is really good in it! Also, it's good even without rice. Yum!"
275326,48972,2007-03-12,5,"This dish was outragiously good!  I did make adjustments to what I had on hand... didn't have salsa or tofu, so I sauteed 1/2 a chopped onion and a whole chopped zuchinni and sprinkled them with garlic salt.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn and probably only 1 cup of cheese to cut fat.  I used Rosarita MILD enchilada sauce.  My family cleaned their plates and went away totally satisfied.  Thanks for the inspiration!"
909142,48972,2008-09-05,5,"This was sooo yummy! I didn't use tofu, because my husband doesn't like it, and I halfed the recipe because it was just for the two of us, but we still had leftovers for lunch for a couple of days. I LOVED it, and so did my husband, even though he is VERY picky, and a big meat eater. Very filling."
194993,48972,2008-11-23,4,"This was good and gets extra points for being so easy. I, too, would have liked the sizes of cans (corn, enchilada sauce) specified. This made way more than I expected. I used large flour tortillas, as I find the corn tortillas impossible to work with, and I got about 14 very large enchiladas. I don't understand the use of the tofu. It's not enough to contribute anything to the dish. Next time I will either leave it out entirely or else increase it to about 1 1/2 cups. But I will be making this again. Nice recipe."
1104605,48972,2009-01-21,5,"I had a previous enchilada recipe that this recipe will now REPLACE! It's wonderful. Very easy and delicious. The corn is a nice touch. My husband loved these. We made a half batch just for the two of us (used 10 small soft tortillas) and the leftovers disappeared without hitting the freezer first (doesn't happen too often). 
I replaced the tofu with about 1/2 cup of soy grounds (the dried kind you get at bulk food stores).
This was a huge hit at our house, we'll be making it often. Thank you for sharing!"
58931,48972,2009-01-24,5,"Delicious recipe!  I made half a batch and used corn tortillas, which yielded 12 enchiladas.  I replaced the tofu with a very small zucchini, used 1 c. frozen corn, skimped a bit on the (soy) cheese, omitted the salt, and used 1 large can (28 oz I think) green enchilada sauce.  They were absolutely fabulous!  I looked up the original bake-off recipe for can sizes, and the original calls for 15 -oz can size for beans, 11-oz. size for corn (Mexi-corn), and 10-oz size for the enchilada sauce, which I can't think would be enough sauce -- or maybe I'm a sauce-a-holic!  Ha-ha.  I'm very glad to have found this recipe -- thank you for posting!"
137838,48972,2009-02-23,5,I will definitely be making this again.  I sauteed 2 zuchini and 1 squash and subbed that for the tofu and I used homemade salsa (2 cups) and enchilada sauce (4 cups).  I was using small corn tortillas and I got 28 of them.  This is a great recipe.  Thanks!
520277,48972,2012-05-05,5,"Yum!  I added some taco seasoning, onion powder, chili pepper flakes, garlic powder and used tempeh instead of tofu.  I halved the recipe and used mild green enchilada sauce (the big can) and cooked up some Mexican rice for the side.  It was delicious!  My non-vegetarian mom and dad loved it also!"
1179225,48972,2013-09-13,4,"Really good, easy and filling. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
143318,223242,2007-04-26,5,Very good! This would be nice on all kinds of salads.
487387,223242,2007-05-01,5,"Thanks for a great dressing recipe. I made up a double batch with wine ripen tomatoes and basil. It was very tasty.
Tee"
231054,223242,2007-05-08,5,"Yes, the addition of the soy sauce is a little different -- but this is just AWESOME!!!  I picked up some baby Heirloom tomatoes at the grocery store yesterday and used them.  I also had some of the small fresh mozzarella balls and added them (I cut the tomatoes and mozarella balls in half -- just so they could absorb more of the dressing.  I had some green onions that I added also.  This is sooooo simple to put together and the flavor is outstanding.  The dish looked so attractive -- all the various colors of the Heirlooms, the cheese and the green onion.  The next time I make it (which will be very soon), I'm going to add some fresh basil.  I can't wait to serve this at our next barbecue.  Plus I didn't have any Tamari on hand, so I just used plain soy sauce.  I want to use the Tamari the next time.  Thank you for posting this."
156034,223242,2007-05-14,4,"Very good.  I really enjoyed it, but think that next time I will lessen the balsamic vinegar to 2 Tbsp. instead of 3 as it overpowered the tomato in my opinion.  All my guests liked it and requested the recipe.

Thanks Trinkets....another keeper!!"
486725,223242,2007-06-19,3,I put the dressing over tomatoes and topped it with arugula. It was a good salad. The soy is definitely subtle.
537188,126072,2008-01-27,5,I usually always manage to make my pastry go hard and brittle but this worked out really well - it was nice and soft!
476326,126072,2009-12-24,4,"Soft, tender crust, but a pain to try to roll.  I finally gave up and pressed it into place by hand.  That's definitely my suggestion!  I'd use it again though."
1701315,126072,2012-03-30,5,"I've never made a pie crust using milk before.  This was a wonderfully tender crust and had good flavor.  I also had trouble rolling it out, but it patted into the tin nicely and tasted fantastic, so no complaints here!"
369715,289582,2008-04-02,4,"Made for Spring PAC 2008. I made this for my boys for breakfast. We all really enjoyed them. I followed the recipe as written other then I used 2 eggs per taco and didn't add the picante sauce. I did pop it in the microwave for 15 seconds to melt the cheese before serving. Yummy, quick and easy breakfast."
133174,289582,2008-04-05,4,"This is exactly as stated ""A fairly standard breakfast taco"".  It was made with egg substitute.  I assume that the milk is to beaten in with the egg.  I did use plain yogurt instead of the milk.  The cheese was sprinkled on the warmed tortilla and then a little over the egg mixture.  Made for PAC Spring 2008."
86512,289582,2008-04-09,5,"This is really good. I used 2 eggs and no milk.  I half fried-half scrambled my  eggs. I fry them until the white  is white and almost cooked and then I scramble them. Other than that, I followed the directions.  This was easy to make and has ingredients I always have on hand. I will be making this again. Made for PAC  Spring '08"
305531,289582,2008-04-20,4,Very good! I used 2 eggs per taco and a Mexican cheese blend. Very easy to make and DH loved it. Thanks J Irish. Made for PAC Spring 2008.
377499,264683,2009-08-26,4,"Very good, we'll make again. I might cut down the allspice. I waited for the batch to cool before eating with yogurt and strawberries. I'll probably also make some granola bread. Thanks for posting!"
788038,397642,2010-07-06,4,Super Easy and goes great with a nice plate of Spaghetti
679689,152441,2008-01-27,2,I guess ginger is just not my thing.
21752,37120,2002-09-29,5,"Yummmmmmmmmmmm!  The lemon works so well with the sugar and the carrots, I could get addicted.  I like it just a little more lemony, so I added some lemon zest.  I also didn't have any baby carrots, so I just used some baby carrot-sized slices of adult carrots.  I knew I had a good thing going right away, and made enough for dinner tonight and leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  They are going to be so jealous of me in the office when they smell this heating up in the microwave.  Junebug, 10 stars!"
8688,37120,2002-10-08,5,"Theses carrots were absolutely delicious!  So very simple to prepare with great results! I cooked as directed and when adding the lemon, salt & pepper, parsley and butter I added also 1 tsp of sugar. Excellent recipe!  Thanks, Junebug!"
56225,37120,2002-12-02,5,I love this recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and got many compliments. My kids loved these carrots and I think this recipe is destined to become a family favorite. I may try it in the future with dill instead of parsley just for a variation.
41981,37120,2002-12-03,5,"I followed the recipe exactly, except for the lemon.  I had none, so I used fresh lime juice.  This recipe was wonderful.  Our guests really enjoyed it."
67899,37120,2003-10-20,4,"This is a very nice way to dress up ordinary carrots. I agree that the lemon juice gave it a nice zing. I think next time I'll take Mirj's suggestion and add some lemon zest, and maybe a little more sugar at the end, too!"
103809,37120,2004-06-21,4,This was easy and tasty.  I even used dried parsley and was pleased with the results.  This will be made often at my house.
64203,37120,2004-11-19,5,"This is a great way to dress up carrots for a nice side dish. The lemon provides just enough zest and the sugar and butter are such a nice compliment to the other flavors! I had to use dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh and it still turned out wonderful! I will be making this recipe again! Thank so much!
Kristen"
172169,37120,2004-11-19,4,Easy + tasty + healthy. Rare combo!
141293,37120,2004-11-21,5,"These were just delicious.  I never would have put lemon with carrots, but you can believe that I will from now on.  Outstanding flavor!"
86520,37120,2004-12-04,5,Very nice taste. I use bottled lemon juice and dried parsley as I never have fresh on hand. I also did as Mirj and used reg carrots sliced. I also sprinkled a little sugar over them as I mixed the other ingredients in. Thanks for a new way to do carrots.
4470,37120,2004-12-26,5,Just the right amount of lemon and the sugar gives a rich flavor Thanks Junebug for a nice sidedish to my Christmas dinner
37636,37120,2005-01-02,5,"Very tasty! The sugar takes the edge off the lemon but still leaves a nice zing. I think it is important to add the sugar at the beginning of  cooking to give the sweetness time to get into the carrots, rather than just coating them. Extra sugar is not really necessary at the end, nor is any extra lemon- this recipe may look deceptively simple, leaving one wondering if they should do more, but it is perfect as is. Thanks for posting!"
128950,37120,2006-12-13,5,"Carrots can be addictive!!  We loved these, very simple and delicious.  I only used a little of a tablespoon of butter and still thought they were wonderful."
275335,37120,2007-01-12,5,This is a lively way to do baby carrots.  Didn't use as much butter and didn't add additional sugar.  Delish!
126104,37120,2007-02-16,4,"These were very good.  I had them with some blandish pork chops and corn on the cob.  The lemon in the carrots complimented the rest of the meal quite well.

They were slightly tart for my tastes, so I added a tiny bit of Splenda after the carrots were done, and that did the trick."
294000,37120,2007-02-25,5,"These were easy and fast and tasted great.  It was a nice change from the usual sweet, glazed carrots.  Thanks."
240001,37120,2007-04-08,5,"Very good!  I did not add the extra sugar at the end like some did.  I made this last night for my Easter dinner, and they all disappeared.  The parsley did a nice job of adding color.  I will make this again.  Thank you for posting!"
774665,37120,2008-03-16,5,This is a nice way to serve carrots. I went ahead and added a teaspoon of sugar at the end and they were really nice.
322217,37120,2008-08-04,5,This was perfect for carrots.   I sliced them lengthways into quarters and followed the recipe exactly.   I served the carrot wiht panfried fish and a buttery mash - what  aperfect dish - yum!  Thanksfor sharing
163112,37120,2013-06-09,5,Absolutely delicious!  Made for TOTM/Parsley 6/13.
217360,116088,2005-07-25,2,"The maple syrup was a welcome change of flavour and I used a mixture of raisins and sultanas in the cake mixture instead of walnuts. Maybe my bananas were a little small but the cake turned out quite dry and baking soda-y. Overall, it wasn't very exciting."
138462,116088,2005-08-08,5,"I made this cake on the weekend and was very pleased with the results.  Contrary to the previous review I found it to be moist and delicious, and there was no overhwhelming flavour of baking soda???  I thought the maple syrup added a delicious twist and added to an already fabulous flavor.  I added milk chocolate chips and that made this coffee cake truly devine!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe I know I will make often!"
36347,116088,2006-06-10,4,"This cake worked out quite well for me (note about comment below - a strong baking soda aftertaste usually means it's time for a new box); it was nice and moist with great texture.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because I had them on hand, and they seemed to do the trick. However, I found the cinnamon in the topping overpowered the maple syrup (I really don't like cinnamon with bananas as a rule), but I will still use this recipe again, with the cinnamon left out."
223898,116088,2007-08-16,4,"I thought this was pretty good.  I also found it to be on the dry side. I couldn't really taste any maple flavor but that could have been the cinnamon as another reviewer suggested. I used sliced almonds as I was out of walnuts.  All in all, this was very good and I would make again. Will try with the honey."
280271,279957,2011-08-18,5,"02/10/2008 Quick, easy and delicious! This has a slight tang to it. Makes a great side dish. Update: I made this again and took a photo. I can't believe it took so long to prepare it again. Thanks for posting. :) I rated this again on 06/24/10...when I took the photo...well guess what...I'm back...and it was just as delicious!

323186,279957,2012-05-16,5,"I love cabbage so this was sure to be a winner for me and indeed it was.  Quick, easy and delicious.  I sliced up an onion as well and fried it with the bacon,  and I chose to serve this tossed with linguini for a very nice supper dish, I liked the use of garlic powder and the touch of mustard  ... thank you, this was very much enjoyed!   Made for PRMR tag game"
1531249,279957,2012-12-26,5,"I have been looking for a side dish to go with Christmas dinner, and this is terrific!  My whole family enjoyed it very much."
2001617415,279957,2018-03-21,0,I've been making this for years minus the mustard and I use 2-3 fresh garlic cloves with the stir frying the cabbage in the bacon oil. It's really good over steam white rice.
479336,118589,2008-08-22,5,"I lost my recipe that is the same as this - good to find it here.  This is awesome icing - not too sweet.  The trick is to keep beating it, even when it looks curdled - just keep going and it will smooth out and be terrific.  Thanks grandma2969!"
545507,268335,2007-12-02,5,"I made these for our family rodeo this past weekend, and everyone loved them! They were super easy and delicious!"
29782,142384,2006-02-02,5,"This was really good. I didn't have a bermuda onion so I used a red onion and added minced garlic along with the powdered garlic. We like garlic so that is the reason I added alittle more to the hamburgers. I also liked the idea of adding catsup on top of the burger before adding the cheese to melt. 
I fried the burgers in a pan but this summer I will grill them on the grill. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
178427,142384,2011-12-14,5,Terrifis burgers! Adding the catsup before the cheese is a grand idea. We really enjoyed this recipe and will make again. Thanks for sharing.
37449,97699,2004-08-22,5,"This was so easy to make and so good! My husband had this with leftover chicken over spagetti. I roasted some squash, onions and tomatoes and served over spagetti with the sauce. Delicious! Thank you for a quick sauce that I will make often!"
124249,97699,2004-11-17,5,"This was  very quick and easy sauce. I am not a big fan of alfredo sauce like the rest of my family but I must say this tasted pretty good. 

Thanks Connie K."
187281,97699,2006-01-14,5,"I have made this several times usually taking leftover chicken and adding it to the sauce to make chicken alfredo. We have this on our diet ""cheat"" day since it is so high in fat. Mmmm!"
28636,97699,2006-04-20,5,"We have made this often and find it to be both tasty and convenient.  We have used Neufchatel (1/3 less fat) cheese and 2% milk with good results.  Also, we like to replace 1/2 cup of the milk with 1/2 cup white wine for additional flavor.  It is good over pasta, chicken, broccoli, or aspargus.  Thanks for sharing this one!   "
250238,97699,2006-04-22,5,I also made mine with RF cream cheese and 1% milk and powdered parmesan cheese and it turned out great!  I served it over scallop and shrimp stuffed shells and baked it in the oven with a crumb topping.  Thanks for the great recipe!
176615,97699,2006-05-16,5,"Great quick recipe that all enjoyed. Made a half recipe to liven up some leftover fettucini. Used reduced-fat cream cheese and 1% milk with good results. This is one of those recipes you'll use again and again. Very handy. Thanks, Connie, for sharing!"
22973,97699,2006-07-20,5,"SO EASY!!!!
This is very good and so very easy to make.I made Fettuchinni
and added shrimp and crab it was delicious.THANKS,Darlene"
356062,97699,2006-10-02,5,Super easy and yummy too! Everyone on my house loved it.
359716,97699,2008-02-27,5,I tried this the other night over chicken with noodles - it was simply delicious. The only change I made was to use a lower fat cream cheese.
363830,97699,2008-03-29,5,I was looking for a quick alfredo sauce recipe and couldn't seem to find anything which didn't use heavy cream (I don't have any in the house). When I found this one I was a little weary of using cream cheese...but it came out FABULOUS! Thanks for the recipe...
539977,97699,2008-08-05,5,Very yummy. I tried this in place of Kittencal's as I didn't have any cream. Just as good!  Thanks!
747179,97699,2009-05-12,5,my sister made this with chicken and ziti and it was excellent. there was nothing left .a great sauce :)
79229,97699,2010-03-03,5,I made this tonight for supper and it was quick and easy. I did it all in the microwave.
45201,97699,2010-05-28,5,"So wonderfully rich and creamy. the best alfredo sauce I've ever had! But be sure to use the real parmesan cheese, not the stuff in a can."
472690,97699,2010-11-23,5,"Easy and delicious, thank you!!!"
1927700,97699,2011-06-08,5,I didn't have any heavy cream so this recipe was perfect! Super tasty and had such a nice consistency. Easy to make and would make it again!
1110058,97699,2011-08-19,5,I live a very long way from a grocery store with cream.  I was craving shrimp alfredo last night.  I found this recipe and it was awesome!!!!  (Still shocked I had cream cheese) But very glad I did!  I used fresh garlic and added sauteed shrimp.  Perfect!!!!
87577,31984,2003-05-30,5,"This is a wonderful ""make a memory"" for children, plus it is a delicious dessert.  I've used strawberries, peaches, raspberries, and blueberries - all equally good.  The grandchildren ask to make Granmom's ice cream each time we visit!"
231661,31984,2006-07-11,5,"This is a great recipe to make with the kids - they LOVED it!  We couldn't wait for it to freeze before eating and it was sooooo delicious.  The taste of naturally, sweet strawberries were wonderful.  My DS has already asked for blueberry ice cream for tomorrow!   Thanks for sharing.  Yum!! "
268778,31984,2006-09-23,5,"It is an easy and very lovely ice cream.  My DH, mother-in-law and myself enjoyed it very much, even though my DH never likes brought strawberry ice cream.  
However, I changed the procedure a little bit as it is stated in the 'Zaar' dictionary that it is better to add sugar at the end of whipping the cream so it will increase the size more and stand longer.  So I mixed the half frozen strawberry with sugar in the food processer before adding to the whipped cream in the blender.  I made 3 servings the first time.  However, my DH, MIL and I all agreed that the amount was enough for 6 servings after a main meal, so it meant that we only have 261/2 carloies each.
When I made it the second time, I blendered it again when it started frozen again, the texture was much creamy.
Thank you for sharing."
70662,31984,2006-09-25,5,this was so easy and so good-- i love how creamy it is for how little effort you have to put in!
392154,31984,2006-11-22,5,this recipe was great and i didnt even use a food processor! i used a blender and it turned out great!
781392,31984,2008-04-15,0,This was a wonderful alternative for homemade ice cream.  I made this for my husband on an extremely hot day when I wanted some ice cream (I had all the ingredients) and came across this recipe.  It provided almost instant gratification.  I had no idea where the ice cream maker was and it was too hot to look.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and my husband could not tell.  Great for when you want something yummy that is not a smoothie!
592157,31984,2008-06-30,5,"This turned out much better than I had expected. It's very close to the ""real"" thing. Great result for the time and effort. 
Thank you for sharing."
274719,138263,2006-06-29,5,"Just flat out delicious!  I didn't have any parsley, so I didn't use any.  I served this with a bruschetta topping/ salsa.  Thanks for the post!"
1244997,138263,2009-12-23,5,"Wonderful recipe. I halved the butter and replaced with EVOO. I used jarred minced garlic, and sprinkled the chips with sea salt before baking. Will be made often! Thanks for sharing Not-2-Sweet"
27783,44848,2004-11-02,4,"Very good.  This bakes up into a lovely looking, very tall loaf that slices beautifully.  This is not overly sweet and has just the right amount of nuts to balance the flavor. A little less moist than I prefer, but still a very good recipe that would be a good choice for gift giving."
159913,44848,2004-11-09,5,I made this bread yesturday and it's just about all gone. Husband cuts it off in chunks.  Made a great size loaf will make it again. Thanks from New Zealand
121690,44848,2006-09-10,5,I just realized that I never reviewed this even though I've made it several times. Those durned bananas just WILL go to mush at times and I need to do something with them. I like the texture of this bread--I think it's the shortening that makes the difference. I often use 5 bananas rather than 4 because I'm never sure if the ones we get here are long enough to qualify as medium.
881884,313432,2008-07-13,5,"I have been making my apple pies with this streussel and Dutch topping alternately. Its really, really goood topped with vanilla ice cream. Will try to make the french topping the next time i make apple pie, the ingredients seem scrumptious combined! Thanks for posting!"
899007,313432,2008-07-26,5,Loove the dutch topping!!!
886144,313432,2008-08-12,5,looove the streussel topping!!
130819,313432,2009-02-02,5,Loved the French Topping! I am sure the others are going to be wows too. Can certainly see why you had happy customers. Have this printed and in my file drawer ready to use at a moments notice - no more digging through cookbooks or looking for toppings. Not only added to my favorites collection but added to the apple recipes I use for the fall apple crop. Thank you for a recipe that will be used for years to come.
363055,313432,2009-09-19,5,I used the French topping on a fresh raspberry pie instead of a top pastry crust.  This was outstanding!!!  Thank you so much for the recipes.  Am anxious to try the other two toppings.
187360,166535,2006-08-08,5,"This was great.  I used a frozen banana so even with the full amount of orange juice it wasn't very thin at all.  My orange juice was pretty sour but the natual sugar of the grapes and banana made it the perfect level of sweetness.  I might try it with a bit of yogurt added sometime, but don't get me wrong it is great as is.  Very simple and delicious.  "
104295,166535,2007-01-01,4,Very nice smoothie.  I usually use frozen bananas for my smoothies but I had a bag of frozen red grapes so I used those and a regular banana (was afraid it would be too thick if they were both frozen).  I juiced two smallish oranges for fresh squeezed juice.  My almost 5 year old and I enjoyed it together as the first thing we ate in 2007!
324621,166535,2007-03-05,2,"I did not like this. I generally like my smoothies to be smooth, so I found the pieces of grape peel distasteful. I wasn't too fond of the flavor either, so sadly after a few sips I poured this out. It was an interesting idea though as I had never heard of putting grapes in a smoothie."
422893,166535,2007-04-18,5,"I was a bit hesitant of trying this as I've never heard of grapes in a smoothie but I bit the bullet & gave it a go, I'm glad I did, this was really great, I used a little under a cup of frozen grapes and a small banana with the orange juice. A nice one I'm sure I'll be making again. Thanks!"
856707,166535,2008-06-08,5,"Delicious! I don't usually drink smoothies and I usually hate the taste. However, this smoothie was great! The taste was perfect, and although I was a little worried about the grape peels, they provided a nice texture. I'll definitely be making this again!"
700841,166535,2009-05-17,5,This was very good. I added some ice cream into mine to make it smoother and to tone down the acid in the orange juice. Very good!
198154,166535,2009-05-24,1,"Sorry, but no one at our house liked this smoothie.  It was way too thin. The small pieces of grape skins provide a unique texture that no one liked. I had to add frozen strawberries to get anyone to drink it.  My families suggestions were to freeze the fruit before blending and peel the grapes.  But if I had time to peel grapes, than I would just cook a healthy breakfast instead of throwing together a smoothie.  Sorry, this one just wasn't for us."
2000367780,166535,2015-07-27,5,"I loved this smoothie, as I was blending this I was worried about the color and grape skin but once i tried it, it was delicious. I loved the taste and the skin provided a nice texture, Ill be making this again soon."
1762248,480558,2012-09-09,5,"""Peel your bananas first...""  No kidding!"
38218,109722,2005-09-11,5,"This was wonderful! I cooked 4 apples, each in it's own baking dish, otherwise followed the recipie, doubling the amounts.  Who wouldda thunk!?  This one's a keeper for sure!"
367164,109722,2008-02-19,0,"Thanks for this great simple recipe Alan!  This was my first attempt at Baked Apples and they came out delicious!  
Unfortunately I had to change the recipe due to what was and wasn't in the pantry.  I used 2 baking apples (quartered, cored and wrapped tightly in foil), 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, 2 tbs. of ground cinnamon, and topped it off with a pat of butter baked in a small tin at 475 for 30 min.
I will definitely have to try it with root beer next time.
Thanks again!"
126104,109722,2015-03-12,5,"These were delicious.  I was surprised, because I wasn&#039;t sure how the root beer would taste (and I adore root beer).

The cinnamon/sugar mixture is enough for 6 apples, and there&#039;s leftover root beer in the bottle.  I made one more apple, because that&#039;s all that would fit in my dish.  I had tons of the root beer mixture in the bowl, maybe too much??   I think next time I&#039;ll probably do 6 apples, and not have to increase the remaining ingredients.

An excellent baked apple."
926354,319600,2008-08-21,0,This sound so good.  I wonder if you can do this in a conventional oven?
254614,319600,2008-09-20,5,"Excellent cobbler, good flavor!
Now saying this, I added more soda.This was after it had cooked in the oven for 35 minutes covered. I followed the recipe exactly, using home canned peach halves that had cinnamon sticks. I used most of the juice and 8 oz. of orange soda,(I didn't have cream soda) and when I took the cover off, the top of the cobbler (cake mix was clumpy and dry) in about four places, so I drizzled the balance of soda over the top that was dry. Since it was hot it spread out over the dry parts and what a difference it made! I then cooked it 15 to 20 minutes more Uncovered! Let it cool at least 15 minutes so the juice will thicken up. My family could not wait and ate it hot with ice cream. They said it had wonderful flavor and I agree. I will try the cream soda next time and I definitly will  make again. I will wait until it has cooked for 35 minutes again to drizzle the extra soda. It made the topping just right. Thanks for posting!"
53959,209346,2007-03-06,4,This was good. I think next time I might add some ice cubes to make is more of a slushy drink but overall I thought it was pretty good.
354465,209346,2007-05-02,5,"I made this as part of my brunch and I used a frozen banana which thickened it just enough so that it was thicker than milk but thin enough to drink through a straw. I did add two tsp. of sugar because I like mine sweet. The cinnamon was a nice addition. Very good, thank you!! Made for Spring PAC '07."
369715,209346,2009-09-09,4,Made this for breakfast. I followed the recipe as written other then I used bananas I had frozen and I used Splenda instead of sugar. My son and I enjoyed this treat. Made for Fall PAC 2009.
1161447,336935,2009-02-28,3,quick and easy - great to have as something to hold you off until lunch or dinner. I wish there were more apple recipes
37449,31013,2005-02-08,5,"A mild, easy custard to make, not too sweet, although I did add 2 more tsp. of sugar. Thanks you Inez!"
299979,31013,2008-08-12,0,"This great I put in a little cinn.
and my family loved it.
Thanks for the recipe..."
119466,131648,2005-09-02,5,"You are correct about this being very handy to have on hand after a gossipy trip to the beauty parlor--but I also tested it out for days when you are just feeling darn lazy, and it also works very well on those days. :) The technique of putting it on the preheated cookie sheet is a very good one, but you scared me about the Aqua Net so I just briefly pulled the cookie sheet out, tossed the bread on it and stuck it back in the oven. It IS ready in about 5 minutes so you'd best not be on the phone  gossiping so intensely that you forget to check on it. ;) I put this in the freezer in 3 batches on Monday. It is Friday and it is all gone, so there is proof of how handy and how good it is! Thanks, Pot Scrubber, for another entertaining, tasty recipe!"
169969,131648,2005-09-03,5,"Made a whole batch of this to keep in the freezer to pull out for bruschetta and garlic bread for the two week tour of Italy & France! What a great idea! 
P.S. I put a plastic bag over my head so that my hair would not ignite, I hope this tip is useful to others.Thanks Potsie for a great and easy recipe!"
209747,131648,2006-05-02,5,Fantastic and EASY! Love that you can make extra and freeze for later. I did sprinkle it with some italian seasoning and that added a wonderful and pretty touch. Thank goodness I had just washed my hair so it was AquaNet free and I didnt have to worry about it catchin fire!  
28729,131648,2006-07-09,5,"I love easy great tasting bread recipes like these. I am not much of a baker, so something like this is right up my alley. Thanks for making a loaf of bread way more interesting than just butter!!!  Everyone here gave it 5 stars +"
192581,131648,2006-07-11,5,"Put more than my usual amount of butter on this (but less than the recipe recommends) and enjoyed it immensely.  We had this with some olive and tomato pate.  It was definitely crunchy on the bottom and soft and buttery on the top.  I sprinkled liberally with Italian seasoning as well as garlic powder, and we ate 2 pieces each so I froze 4 pieces for later.  My favorite bread recipes always use store-bought bread too.  I wasn't so much worried about hair spray, as the gobs of gel in my hair.  I didn't catch fire though:D"
20480,131648,2006-07-14,5,"Super recipe to have in your freezer Potsie;came out perfect!!! Crispy and buttery at the same time.I made it with crushed garlic and added chopped fresh herbs to my butter mixture.Thanks for sharing this little gem.
Rita"
209983,131648,2006-07-15,5,I made this tonight with dinner.  My family likes breads and garlic breads. I like the fact you can prepare and pop in the freezer for a later date that is a good idea.  I decided to  mix the butter and garlic together before spreading on the bread for a more even flavor as when you sprinkle some tend to get too much or too little.  Thanks for posting.  Next time I would like to add some herbs as you mentioned or even cheese
131126,131648,2006-07-16,5,"Fast, easy, and wonderful to have on hand in the freezer. Tastes good too.  I do love reading and preparing your recipes. They always add a smile to my day and my meal prep.  Thank you Potsie!   =) "
32772,131648,2006-07-17,5,Wait!  My hair just got on fire. LOL  I didn't read the instructions completely. Thought I knew what I was doing. Thanks for a great recipe.
185105,131648,2006-07-17,5,"Delicous and easy!!! I even went out of my way to add a 1/2 slice of very thin mozerella cheese to the top of each slice -- and then serve it with some leftover pizza sauce for dipping!  YUM!!!!  Definite keeper that makes life as a ""gourmet chef"" much easier!  :)"
156034,131648,2006-09-20,5,"NEWSFLASH:
Local woman seen dashing across the street at 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon to wait in line at local grocery for a loaf of the freshest French bread possible.  She was carried out by 2 burly, yet good looking, bodyguards when she attempted to reach into the oven and grab a loaf before it was completely burned!  Seems the new girl at the grocery wandered off to the back of the store to smooch with a stockboy, thus leaving those heavenly loaves unattended.
Witnesses say the woman was yelling ""I was just trying to help and I needed a loaf to prepare a recipe from my friend, Potscrubber"".  The witnesses also admit to being a bit confused, but didn't mind when they were all invited to the perp's house for dinner.

PS...this stuff is SOOOOOOO good. (I did really make it the other night).  I think I gained 10 lbs.  I DID DEMAND that if I am incarcerated for trying to help the bread girl out, that they serve me THIS bread with my Evian water!!!"
212417,131648,2006-09-20,5,"What a GREAT TASTY and QUICK garlic bread recipe!! I bought a hot steaming loaf of French bread at the store the other day, and 4 p.m. precisely!! Sliced it and threw it in the freezer. I just KNEW it would be the perfect accompaniment to the <a href=""/168913"">Quick Shrimp Chowder</a>, which we had for dinner. I couldn't have been more correct!! I topped it with a little of the left over Monteray Jack cheese, yummy in my tummy!! The only problem I see with this recipe is that you have now created a monster!! I will HAVE to go to the store at 4 p.m. from now on for the bread!!! Thanks Potsie for a wonderful recipe!!"
129958,131648,2006-10-24,5,"Delicious!  I prepared as directed by the recipe!  I love bread and this is absolutely wonderful!  I think my loaf of french bread was about 2 feet long! LOL!  I love the convenience of having this in the freezer and being able to have it ready in a snap!  The bread cooks up just right, you have a crispy toasted buttery, garlic side and a moist buttery, garlic side!  Pure Heaven!  I plan to keep this in my freezer at all times! Thanks Pot Scrubber!"
248023,131648,2006-12-15,5,"I will never buy frozen garlic bread again!  This recipe is so simple to make and tastes so good.  Tastes so much better than the store bought in my opinion, no preservatives...and cheaper too!  It's so handy to keep in the freezer and pull out when you just need a slice or two... It was a wonderful accompaniment to my big Italian meal featuring Mama Iuliuci's ""Don't Skip a Step"" spaghetti sauce and Famous Meat-A-Balls.  I will keep this bread in my freezer from now on!"
407781,131648,2007-03-06,5,This was so easy to prepare! Taste was outstanding. A resounding 5+ stars!  I work Monday-Friday my day starts at 4:30a.m. and ends at 8:00 p.m. so I'm VERY limited on time.  This goes very well with a dish of spaghetti and meatballs on either Thursday or Friday night when my brain is totally fried. My household loved the bread more than the spaghetti.  I will be keeping this handy in the freezer from now on! THANK YOU! What a life saver!
125640,131648,2007-04-24,4,Good and easy. I added the oregano and used whole wheat French bread to make it a little healthier. Thanks.
122878,131648,2007-06-05,5,"This is such a quick, easy and good recipe for garlic bread that I served with spaghetti and a salad. Everybody in our home loves it. At times, I will combine the butter and garlic powder, mixing well and spread on bread. It is also very good sprinkled with Parmesan,Romano or Jack cheese. This is a very versatile recipe. Love it, love it, love it! Thanks for sharing Potsie."
74281,131648,2007-08-13,5,Another fabulous and easy Potsie recipe. I used crusty whole grain French bread and about 1 teaspoon of garlic which lazy me just mixed in with the butter after I softented it. No freezing for me as we use the entire loaf between dinner and the leftovers for lunch today. DELICIOUS!
579248,131648,2007-09-04,5,"Yummy. My favorite ""bread"" for garlic bread is leftover hamburger or hotdog buns. They are just the right texture and thickness, and not much good for anything else after the meat is gone."
296027,131648,2008-05-30,5,"Love these - easy to do - especially since we ladies of leisure need all the time we can get to keep our colour up - and talk trash!  :)~  And, it is simple enough, the kids can do it so Mommy's Aqua Net is a safe distance from the heat source!  Thanks for posting, PotScrubber!  Made for ZWT4!"
157167,131648,2008-06-08,5,"Works great!  I always keep my french bread in the freezer, and normally butter it frozen - I never thought to butter it first!  And the shredded cheese suggested was nice too.  For ZWT4 Flying Duchess'"
140132,131648,2008-06-12,5,"I have made garlic bread like this for years.  Its a good basic bread to serve with any Italian dish.  Delicious, thanks for posting."
324390,131648,2008-06-23,5,"Waking up to a bad hair day, I decided to check out this recipe for help. No luck as far as my hair goes, but I did end up with some pretty tasty garlic bread. My man-friend declared it the best part of dinner and it was enough of a distraction to keep his eyes off of my bushy hair. Thanks Potsie! (Forgot to add I used Parmesan cheese and oregano - I'm on the World Tour you know ;) )"
461834,131648,2008-07-01,5,"Well how can you go wrong with bread, garlic and butter!!!  We just loved it!!!  Thanks Pot Scrubber for posting this recipe and  your stories are too fun with your recipes!!!!  Oh and btw I planned on adding some mozzarella cheese to the bread, but my DH threw it away because the date said best to be used by a certain date, but it was fine but no cheese, total bummer!!!  But we still loved the bread this way!!!"
113941,131648,2008-07-10,5,"Same way I've been makin mine, too! Easy-peasy and can't be beat!!! I took the easy road this time, though, and sliced it right though horizontally, slathered it with the garlic butter and some pre-grated asiago, parmesan and romano cheeses...gotta LOVE those little containers of the pre-grated!!!), and tossed it in the oven QUICK! (I had 3 things going on the stove, so had to hurry!!) What's a good Italian meal without good garlic bread??? One of the best parts of it! ;) :) Made for the ZWT4 Thanks Potsie! :)"
627420,131648,2008-09-15,5,I followed Wildflour's lead and just sliced the bread in half.  I melted my butter and garlic together then used a pastry brush to brush on the butter.  Works great!  Also I added a dash or two of salt in with the butter.  Went great with my supper #39900!  Thanks Scrubbie!
82616,131648,2010-01-23,5,One word Potsie. AWESOME !!! My mother in law is here the weekend and we had this with our spaghetti. This one is a keeper :)
1397788,131648,2010-01-24,5,Love this recipe and idea for using the freezer as there are only 2 of us eating and this system prevents us from eating the entire loaf in one setting!
519896,131648,2010-06-15,5,"We had leftover rolls from a party and I hate to throw them out - and freezing them to use for sandwiches later doesn't always work well.  So, I searched on Zaar and found this recipe.  I made it last night and spread the garlic butter on the rolls and wrapped them up to in foil (and froze some extra for later).  My son came home an hour later and asked what smelled so good.  Before they were even frozen, he had one in the toaster oven and proclaimed it delicious (I had a bite and agree!)  Thank you!"
350750,131648,2012-03-04,5,A great alternative to the frozen bread.  Thank you for a tasty garlic bread.  Used day old bread and made some that night and froze the rest.
954122,318332,2008-09-12,0,I made this recipe and was very disappointed.  I believe that the amoutn of the peaches should be 4 cups not 8.  I remade this with 5-1/2 cups sugar and 4 cups sugar and it came out fine.  I now have 7 half pints and three pints of syrup to put over ice cream.
1179225,318332,2014-10-04,5,"Nice, fresh peachy flavor. After processing the peaches floated to the top of the jars, I&#039;m not sure how to correct that, but the flavor if really nice. It&#039;s not a a real thick jam. but I thought it was just right. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2002267205,318332,2018-09-05,2,"3 batches and not one set up - great syrup- great flavor,,,, but not jelly at all and not what I wanted to make"
305147,232921,2007-07-29,4,"My 5 year old and I made this for 'Zaar tag and really enjoyed it. Amazingly, my five year old really liked it too! (And immersion blender is the way to go...) It took about twice as much liquid to get it thin enough (we had Hass avocados, I know some other types are more watery, so that could be it.)  I think next time I would use part chicken broth to thin and would crush the tomato ice and float a small scoop on top.  Very refreshing on a warm summer evening!"
107135,422998,2010-06-21,5,ok i cant believe this was not review really easy and tastes   great  subbed walnuts for peanuts  zaar tour zingo
80353,422998,2010-06-22,5,Very nice fruit salad.  Pantry ingredients and ready in a flash.  Thanks.
1072593,422998,2010-06-22,5,Woofed down by the grandkids quicker than a hiccup.  Made for ZWT #6 ZINGO.
464080,422998,2010-06-22,5,Simple yet tasty.  I loved the way the pineapple juice brought out the freshness in the banana. . .if that makes any sense LOL!  I used fresh pineapple with the collected juices.  I also subbed lime juice for lemon juice on ACCIDENT. . .sorry about that. . .but the lime juice works just as well!  Thanks for sharing.  Made as a healthy dessert for ZWT #6  ZINGO.
424680,422998,2010-06-23,5,"Although I do use canned pineapple in lots of recipes, when I can get great fresh pineapple to use, I definitely will use it instead, & that's what I did in this recipe! Otherwise I followed it right on down & really enjoyed this salad ~ Love every single ingredient used here! Thanks for sharing a great keeper recipe! [Made & reviewed during the ZINGO part of ZWT6]"
220348,422998,2010-06-25,5,"Very refreshing! I made it last night for dessert. It was very easy to double, and found that it made for a good breakfast as well."
39835,422998,2010-06-26,5,We really enjoyed this so-easy to make salad -- we skipped the nuts and instead of honey used corn syrup (next time I'll be sure to buy the honey) but this still worked out wonderfully! Thanks for sharing this keeper!
56003,422998,2010-06-27,5,"Yummy, yummy, yummy, kellychris!
Bananas are not my favorite fruit, but this goes down real sweet.  You can take a trip to the tropics even in winter with this delightful salad.  Thnx for sharing your recipe, kellychris.  Made for the Voracious Vagabonds of ZWT 6."
526666,422998,2011-04-05,5,"YUM! So easy, and so good (and good for you! ;-) ) I made this for myself, and I especially liked the hint of cinnamon 'honey', paired with the fruits and nuts! Delish! :D Thanks so much for sharing this simple delight, kellychris...I'll tuck this one away in the 'keeper' file!"
2001595396,422998,2017-06-22,5,Made this for a small dinner party and it was a huge success. So very easy to prepare and fast too!
527607,244330,2007-08-12,4,"I really enjoyed this, very simple and easy to make.  Next time, i will bake it with some onion and garlic as well.  I used yellow zucchini because the green at the market looked awful."
390859,244330,2007-09-16,5,Tastes very good and is so easy to make.  I followed recipe exactly.
369715,244330,2012-04-03,4,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written but we thought it could have used some other seasonings. Next time I would use garlic salt instead of salt and some pepper. Made for Spring PAC 2012
56919,70909,2005-04-16,5,"What a lovely, simple and delicious treat.  I wanted to make 2 of these and this is how I did it:  I had two containers of blueberries that were each 4.4 oz which turned out to be about 3/4 of a cup.  So I put a whole container of blueberries into each ramekin (sorry I don't know the size of the ramekins but they are pretty large).  I used one cup of plain yogurt (instead of sour cream) and mixed it with one tablespoon of vanilla and covered the blueberries with it and used all of the yogurt mixture.  I measured out a full cup of packed dark brown sugar and sprinkled it over the tops but after using a little more than half of that I decided that was enough sugar.  I broiled in the oven for 3 1/2 minutes and they started smoking but luckily I got out in time before they burned .  The top was slightly crunchy and I was surprised the yogurt was still cold after being in the oven but found I loved the contrast of the temperatures within the dish.  Cold creaminess in contrast to warm melty gooey crunchy sugar is a very good thing indeed.  Next time, I will use the entire amount of brown sugar the recipe calls for as the sugar reduces dramatically after cooking.  A wonderful and indulgent way to enjoy blueberries.  Would be a great dessert to serve to guests as it's simple to prepare, has great presentation value and is unique too. "
32724,70909,2005-04-16,5,This was great.  We used yogurt in place of the sour cream.  utter simplicity.
101823,70909,2005-05-08,5,"I downsized this to just one serving for myself this Mother's Day morning.  It was spectacular.  I did slide my ramekin in the oven for a couple of minutes before putting it under the broiler.  The wind is crisp this morning, and a fully warm dish seemed like a good idea.  It was.  :)  I even dipped slices of multi-grain toast in the blueberry juice in order to enjoy every last drop.  Thanks so much for posting."
209771,70909,2005-08-16,1,"My family and I found this way to sweet in fact we couldn't finish it. Ugggg also the Brown sugar never melted it just caught fire, thank goodness I was watching it. You would have to have an incredible sweet tooth for this one. "
157167,70909,2005-08-17,5,"Delicious!!  I used frozen berries, which I microwaved before adding the other ingredients (It was the perfect size for our toaster oven!) I also found it just a bit too sweet and cut down on the sugar the second time.  We will definately be making this again."
107308,70909,2005-10-03,4,"DH and I enjoyed this lovely dessert; however, we both felt that the vanilla flavor was too strong so I will reduce that the next time I make it.  Also I do agree that one could cut back on the amounts of sour cream and brown sugar."
451060,70909,2008-02-16,5,"What a great idea! I modified this recipe by using plain non-fat yogurt and only three tablespoons (one serving) of demerara sugar, as I was out of brown. It was delicious, and I can't wait to try it with the blackberries that I have in the fridge!"
532510,70909,2008-06-01,5,"This was so easy!! My blueberries weren't super sweet so I used close to the full amount of sugar. Very yummy!
Just microwaved a second bowl for 15 minutes and the warm blueberries are fantastic!"
461724,70909,2008-07-18,2,"Sorry, but I couldn't eat this. The flavors and textures just didn't go together for me."
136997,480215,2012-07-01,5,"This is awesome! There's nothing I don't like about this recipe, other than I should have bought more avocado. made for Everyday Holiday tag game. :)"
381180,480215,2012-07-06,5,"I LOVED this!  A great combination of flavors!  I ate this as a light dinner, and am glad I have extra bacon cooked and more avocado, so I can quickly make it for breakfast tomorrow!  WooooHoo!  Made for Summer Photo Tag 2012 ~"
65502,480215,2012-07-30,5,"Why does bacon, avocado and maple syrup taste so good together? I have no idea, but it DOES! I used a grainy bread, regular bacon and real Canadian maple syrup that my Aunt just brought for me, directly from a producer in Southern Ontario. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! Made for Went To The Market tag game. Thanks I'mPat! :)"
226863,480215,2012-07-30,5,"Delicious!  I only made one serving, and wished I'd gone ahead and done the entire recipe.  My son is home from college, and he normally sleeps in on Saturdays and Sundays.  However, the smell of bacon lured him out of his room, and he ate this up!  Said it was different but delicious....he'd eat it again. :)"
284897,480215,2012-10-06,5,"Great recipe! I really wondered if this would go together well and it was just so delicious.<br/>I used a crust sour dough and followed the recipe as written, although I did use sugar free maple syrup as you suggested Pat.<br/>I made this for myself although ever family member was allowed just a little taste and they also loved it............ I know I will definately be making this again .....Thanks Pat."
526666,480215,2012-11-12,5,"Just loved it, Pat! I had my doubts, but after reading the reviews, I decided to just 'Believe!' And they were right - it is a tasty treat, which I fixed for a great lunch! Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe, I'mPat!"
212609,480215,2012-12-17,5,"My only complaint is that you haven't been screaming about this recipe from the rooftops, and bringing my attention to it way before now Pat!!<br/>I loved it....and I need more of it!!<br/>Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap#71"
1072593,480215,2013-02-04,5,"Avocado, bacon and MAPLE SYRUP?  Great combo!!  To think, just a month ago, I didn't have to know this...  Made for AU/NZ recipe swap."
560491,480215,2013-02-23,5,"Strange, but soooo good!!  Made an written and served on a toasted baguette.  I love syrup and bacon together and everything tastes better with avocado!  Glad I bought real maple syrup for this.  Made for Best of 2012 Cookbook Tag."
1179225,480215,2013-04-05,5,"After seeing this recipe, I knew I had to try it just out of curiosity. It was delicious. Loved the creamy, sweet and salty combination. Thanks for sharing this unusual recipe."
2585084,480215,2013-06-13,5,"Crunchy, sweet, creamy, and salty! My goodness, this sandwich had all kinds of taste sensations.  It is versatile enough to serve as a light meal, snack, or as an appetizer.  I wonder how a vine-ripened tomato from my garden will taste on this sandwich.  I intend to find out very soon."
128473,480215,2013-07-30,5,"I really enjoyed this terrific sandwich I`mPat.  It had wonderful textures and the flavor was to die for.  Really loved the use of maple syrup, avocado and bacon. It was sweet, salty, creamy and deilcious .  A very satisfying sandwich that will leave you wanting more.  Thank you so much for sharing."
869184,480215,2013-10-13,5,"This combination works, although it seems a bit odd at first. I used real Canadian syrup and some good crusty bread."
266635,480215,2013-10-31,5,"This is incredibly delicious!  Avocados are available year round where I live -- so this will be made often.  It&#039;s so hard to describe the flavor -- suffice it to say it&#039;s just absolutely wonderful.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday, October, 2013."
37449,480215,2014-01-08,5,Easy and tasty. I enjoyed the lemon flavor. I used veggie bacon and it worked great. Thanks!
542159,480215,2014-03-02,5,"Great sandwich that quick, easy and so yummy. We loved the contrast between the smoky, salty taste of the bacon and the sweet maple syrup. I had one nice crusty French roll left and the bottom half worked out perfectly to make a yummy open faced sandwich. Thanks for the post."
47892,480215,2014-05-01,5,"I slightly altered the way this was prepared and presented but it turned out well and we devoured it! I baked slices of bacon with good quality real maple syrup, composed the recipe then added a very small drizzle/few drops of maple syrup on top! Yum! Prepared for Make My Recipe Downunder/April."
527607,480215,2014-05-25,5,Heaven! Delicious! Nuff said :)
386585,480215,2015-03-10,5,"This is absolutely delicious, and so simple too!  I used thick-sliced applewood smoked bacon, which really complemented the maple syrup well!  Thanks for sharing."
2001474795,480215,2017-04-06,1,whop the hell likes avocado
2001497311,480215,2017-06-28,0,oh well nice
875503,66975,2010-06-01,5,"We don't like onions, so I left that out--just wrapped the whole potato in bacon and cooked them that way. They were phenomenal! I will be making this quite often. They were especially good with some shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top. Thanks for posting!"
2002314120,250024,2018-10-28,1,"Am I something? I count only 6 ingredients-pb, flour, sugar, egg, cinnamon and nutmeg."
53959,162635,2006-05-29,5,I loved these potatoes. I was running short on time so I slowcooked them on HIGH for 4 1/2 hours and they came out perfect. I didn't really taste much garlic (I might not have put enough as I used a spoonful of the bottled minced kind) so next time I will add a little more. I loved the cream cheese in it. Never thought to use that in my au gratin potatoes before. I will make this again. Thank you.
163112,162635,2006-09-20,5,"I made this for PAC 9/06.  Even DH loved these potatoes & he is a crock pot snob.  I had nice new potatoes from the farmstand so I didn't peel them.  I would recomend stirring every few hours, too.  A simple, delicious recipe that I enjoyed for breakfast & lunch the next day as well.  ;)  Thanks, tazdevilfan!"
354295,45672,2006-12-03,5,"OUTSTANDING!!! You are my hero for posting this recipe! Now, I don't have to call a pampered chef consultant, pay $5.95 plus shipping and tax and wait FOREVER to get a litte bottle of this stuff. Thank you!"
225733,45672,2006-12-07,5,I love it. I use it all the time.  I make my own dried peel by using a vegetable peeler on the outside of an organic orange and let it dry in a cool dark room.
45651,45672,2003-02-05,5,"Dayla...I have used the Pampered Chef Cinnamon Spice for awhile, loved it, but expensive...this copy cat recipe is excellent!!! Tastes the same, but much cheaper! I have used it today on a coffee cake and as a streusel topping on cupcakes. Thanks, so much! It's so much better than cinnamon!"
54716,45672,2003-02-10,5,"The instructions say 10 minutes, but it really doesn't take that long.  It's really a less than 3 minute activity.  You can make this while you are waiting for something else to cook.  And it's much better than plain old cinnimon!"
41809,45672,2003-03-07,5,"This mix is wonderful...really simple to stir up and use.  I made Puffy French Toast with it, and it came out delicious.  My homemade cinnamon rolls came out better than ever with this instead of plain cinnamon.
Good stuff, Dayla...thanks for sharing.

42650,45672,2003-04-16,5,"This stuff is really good.  I used some of it over baked apples, all I can say is Yumm...."
60992,45672,2003-10-13,5,WOW! What a wonderful surprise this turned out to be. The subtle difference between this and just plain ol' cinnamon is amazing! This is a must try!
115621,45672,2004-01-31,5,Cinnamon is a flavor I think that most of us can acquaint with our Grandmother's kitchens. This had that wonderful aroma as well. The taste is there to boot! A true winner. Thank you for sharing this with us. I will be using this mix on many baked goods.
59780,45672,2004-03-20,5,"I have never tried the Pampered Chef spice but I have to say this is an awesome spice combo! I have made this a few times now and it doesn't take long for it to disappear! The first time I made it I used the orange peel but the rest of my family seems to prefer it without. I have also used this recipe to create the most delicious  cinnamon buns ever. (A really fast method is to make Tasty Buns recipe#35889, roll out, sprinkle with brown sugar, top with this baking spice, roll up, cut and bake. Ready to eat in about an hour!) Thanks for posting!"
65056,45672,2004-07-17,5,"I sixthed the recipe because I think I only have about 2 Tbs of cinnamon on-hand total right now  (including the 1 Tbs I used for the recipe) and to fit in the spice jar I have.  I did change a couple things- we can't stand nutmeg really, so I only added a couple dashes (maybe 1/16th tsp).  I also didn't have the orange peel, so I added 1/4 tsp cardamom.  I was really curious as to what this tasted like so I made some cinnamon toast- delicious!  I can't wait to use it in a recipe- its a nice twist, but I'm not sure it would replace cinnamon altogether.  This is really unique and tasty!"
14568,45672,2005-01-23,5,"more to my post.  I use it for almost everything that calls for cinnamon.  I love it on oranges cut like grapefruit, with a little sugar.  I am so glad I found it again.  It is now copied and added to my recipebox"
30228,45672,2005-11-14,5,"I've never used Pampered Chef's, but this stuff is great!  I'm going to make up a large batch, and give as Christmas presents.  Thanks for posting.  This is awesome."
267433,45672,2006-11-01,5,"I haven't ever used the pampered chef spice either, but  have to say this is great. I used it in apple pie and got rave reviews about it. This will replace cinnamon in my house!"
111678,45672,2006-11-03,5,"I'm another one who's never used the Pampered Chef version, but I'm in love with this stuff.  I made a bunch of it last year to go in Christmas baskets and kept a jar for myself.  I've used it often in baking, but it really makes oatmeal taste special--and it makes the best cinnamon toast ever!"
182358,45672,2006-11-13,5,"While I've never purchased the PC Cinnamon Plus, I have tasted it in baked items *yummy*   ... and enjoyed its scent at parties.  Soooooo, I just had to try this recipe!  I love it!  Just love it!  I am a cinnamon fanatic the way a lot of people are chocoholics.  I love this with my morning oatmeal and I've even scooped a spoonful into the ground coffee before brewing.  I foresee me making a lot of this...   Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!"
271267,45672,2007-02-28,5,"So yummy!!! I use this in my morning porridge, my friend uses it in his banana protein shake. would be wonderful in cinnamon rolls or apple pie or bread pudding... so many possibilities. Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
146935,45672,2007-06-11,5,I have never had Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus but this is excellent.  I used it in place of nutmeg in the Williams-Sonoma banana bread recipe from this site and I'm sure I'll find many more things to use it in.  Thanks!
449929,45672,2008-01-04,5,This is wonderful!  I use it in place of cinnamon in all my recipes now!  Thanks!
91340,45672,2008-01-05,5,Don't know why I haven't reviewed this before now. It's been a long time since I first made some of it. This is awesome. It is wonderful in all your baked good and also great making a pot of coffee and sprinkling some on the coffee before brewing.
442988,45672,2008-01-10,5,"I've been using this for a month and I'm completely in love with it.  First of all, it finally got me to Penzey's, which has become an obsession with me ... I used whole allspice, nutmeg and cloves, and ground 'em myself, along with cinnamon sticks.  I used Penzey's orange peel and ground ginger.  It's so wonderfully flavorful I use it in place of cinnamon all the time -- I made applesauce with this, and just made instant oatmeal with it.  I'm not sure I'll ever use plain ol' cinnamon again.  Thanks so much for posting this!"
357323,45672,2008-01-26,5,This is so good! I left out the orange peel since I didn't have any. I also used only 1/2 tsp of nutmeg since I'm not crazy about it. I sprinkled some of this on my French toast this morning(along with a pinch of sugar) and it was divine! No more plain cinnamon at my house.
721674,45672,2008-02-10,5,Wonderful! Awesome in place of just cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe!
468972,45672,2008-04-25,5,Love this spice recipe!
613544,45672,2008-04-25,5,"I used a microplane zester to zest an organic orange, then used the dehydrate setting on my Kitchenaid oven for about 45 minutes to dry the orange zest. I haven't seen it in the spice section of any stores here."
7108,45672,2008-09-20,5,"I love this and it's much more economical than buying it pre-made.  I brew my coffee with this (I add 1 Tbsp, per 5-6 cups, to coffee grounds prior to brewing).  Make sure all your spices are fresh...otherwise, mix can be bitter.  Thanks for posting this recipe; I can't wait to try it in when I bake.   A definite keeper!"
529278,45672,2008-10-06,5,"It's like a grown-up version of cinnamon.  My toast was great.  I can't imagine anyone paying Pampered Chef as much as they charge for a little bottle of spice, so I was never intending on trying this.  But now I don't have to pay all that.  Thanks for the recipe, Dayla!"
138415,45672,2009-01-28,5,"I've been using this instead of cinnamon ever since I found it here a few years ago.  It's terrific!!  I don't put the dried orange peel in it, but everything else stays the same.  Wonderful! I've given it to family in dressed up containers for gifts too."
576273,45672,2010-02-05,5,"this is a very nice spice mix!! love to use on cinnamon rolls (duh,right?) and also when making cinnamon and sugar toast. and if i feel its getting old and needs to be used up i toss it in some water in a small crock pot or pan on the stove and let the house smell like ive been baking all day. Thanks Dayla!"
400708,45672,2011-02-28,5,"Let me add my 5 stars to this great recipe.  I love Pampered Chef's blend and followed this recipe and it taste just like it and sooo much cheaper.  It made TWO shakers full, enough for me and my DD.  I did throw it all in my magic bullet and blended for a few seconds to make sure all was mixed well and that worked great.  Thanks so much for posting - this is what I'll be using from now on!"
1652999,45672,2011-06-01,5,"I have never tried the Pampered Chef version and now I know I never will. The ginger, cloves and nutmeg offer a depth of flavor that makes each dish taste gourmet. I halfed the recipe the first time to make sure it gets used quickly. Also, buying whole spices and grinding what you need is the best way to go here. Thanks dayla."
2145475,45672,2012-01-13,0,My Pampered Chef spice ran out..........and it's very special to my recipes!  I found this copy cat recipe and it tastes exactly the same!  Thank you for sharing!!
37449,45672,2013-04-25,5,Never tried Pampered Chef but such a nice smell and flavor! I&#039;m going to try it in my coffee next. Thanks! Made for the Zaar Cookbook tag.
71298,64355,2003-06-12,5,"I was going to post this recipe but you beat me to it. This is simply one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made. It's like an apple crisp and cheesecake all in one. I made it for Christmas last year and it didn't last long. I find it quite addictive, I kept eating little pieces all thru the night. "
79124,64355,2003-06-15,5,"Delicious!  I made the following changes and it was still wonderful.  I used Splenda in place of white sugar, EggBeaters in place of real eggs and fat free sour cream and it still turned out great.  Everyone love it.  Chris in Phoenix"
82407,64355,2003-09-25,5,"This is certainly worth 5 stars and
more. Since there was only the two 
of us eating this it lasted several
days and it got better each day.  We have decided this is going to be the dessert we are taking to a 
family Thanksgiving Dinner!! Even
though I like any kind of Cheesecake it was so nice to have
something a little different especially with the sliced apples.
I would recommend this to anyone to
try!!!!!!
"
46660,64355,2004-03-23,5,"This was delicious!  I made it several months ago, and completely forgot to post a review.  Memorable, everyone loved it.  Thanks for posting!"
125349,64355,2004-05-30,5,"great cheesecake idea. it is elegant and inexpensive to make. I love the fact that it only calls for 8oz of cream cheese, so it doesn't have all the calories most cheesecakes do. The only difference I made was use a graham cracker pie crust instead of the crust you mentioned, because i had to use it before leaving for vacation. 
thanks for posting!"
170035,64355,2004-11-27,5,This deserves 6 stars.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was really a hit.  
59780,64355,2005-03-07,5,Another winner recipe! I was asked to make a cheesecake for a church function and this recipe was perfect. I had everything already at home and it was easy to put together. I used granny smith apples and recipe#45672 for the cinnamon. I glazed the cheesecake with Non-Dairy Caramel Sauce #108430 for an extra treat. Thanks for sharing this recipe!
201114,64355,2005-03-31,4,This Cheesecake is one of the best I have ever made.  My family went on and on about how good it tasted.  They even suggested that I make the same crust for all the cheesecakes I make from now own.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.
170628,64355,2005-10-04,5,"I wish I could give this 10 stars!  This was absolutely delicious and so easy!  We loved the crispy shortbread crust.  I am going to try this crust with my other cheesecakes.  I think I will double the streuel the next time, because it is so yummy!"
191548,64355,2006-05-23,5,I got rave reviews from coworkers with this one!  Only thing I would change is using a smaller pan and leave out the whipping cream.
178654,64355,2007-11-23,5,"this cheesecake was very easy to make.  i was unsure of a cheesecake recipe using only 1 pkg cream cheese, but it turned out perfectly.  i did cut down on the lemon juice (i used only 1/2 a lemon) and increased the topping ingredients by almost double. using the juice from the whole lemon would have been too much IMO. definitely make again.  took to a thanksgiving dinner and the cheesecake received rave reviews.  i had one slice left to take home."
382203,64355,2007-12-23,4,"Very nice Cheesecake. Next time I'll added a little cinnamon to the filling,but other then that is was great. Thanks"
447165,64355,2008-05-26,5,"Awesome.  I made this as written and would agree with another reviewer that a whole lemon is too lemony-  Next time will use 1/2, or just juice without zest.  Blended well though and was yummy.  Looks very fancy and is not hard to make- even made 1/4 more of everything to fit my 10"" pan.  Thanks for posting this!"
1064108,64355,2008-12-25,4,"I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used half a lemon. I did not care for the crust, but the filling was amazing! I will definitely be using the filling in the future."
1142192,64355,2009-02-18,5,"This recipe was phenominal!  I doubled the ingredients of the topping to get a thicker, all over one, but other than that, it was perfect!  I love lemon, so I did not mind the strong flavor. It offset the sweetness well.  I also tried this with strawberries.  Worked fine!"
549893,64355,2009-04-24,5,This was a great cheesecake. I used a mix of sweet and tart apples for this and it came out awesome. It was a huge hit. I plan to make this again and again. Thanks so much for sharing!!
485773,64355,2009-05-25,5,"After I cut into this, I thought, ""I definitely outdid myself on this one.""  It looked incredible!  But then I tasted it, and the combination of cheesecake, apples and streusel blew me away!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  Everyone loved it!"
1122161,64355,2009-07-18,4,"This cheesecake had a good flavor, I just wish there was more of it. I would definatly double or triple the cheesecake portion. There was not enough cheesecake to offset the tartness of the apples in my opinion. Thanks for posting:)"
1408182,64355,2009-10-10,5,"Definitely one of the best
cheesecakes i have ever had! And very easy to make. Not too sweet, not too rich. Perfect!! Will make this one over and over and over again!!"
933008,64355,2009-11-11,5,Loads of apples to use up and this was was excellent!  Gone in no time!
1426364,64355,2010-06-21,5,"This was great!

Having read the reviews, I was a bit concerned about the results of the crust and also a potential 'too lemony' flavor. It was PERFECT! My husband loved it as part of his 2nd Father's day. To the topping I also doubled it and added some quick oats for crunch. YUM!"
477781,64355,2010-08-23,0,"After reading the reviews for this, I went out and bought my first springform pan (at 57) and made this for a Christmas dessert. Doubled the streusel topping as some suggested. WOW!! DH said it's the best dessert I've ever made. The flavors all go together so well. Yum, yum,yum! Will DEFINITELY be making it again!"
253476,64355,2010-09-05,5,"This was a great surprise for me! I'd never made a cheesecake before - mostly because I usually find them too rich and dense - but this recipe intrigued me, so I decided to give it a try for a potluck. As other reviewers have said, the combination of flavors was great. I particularly liked the crust, which was a huge improvement on the traditional graham-cracker crust, in my opinion. I diced the apples rather than slicing them, which worked great, although when I make this again, I might double the apple layer... I really liked them and wanted more :) I could see making maybe 1.5 times the cheesecake layer, too. But proportions aside, this cheesecake had a great flavor and wasn't too heavy, and it got raves at the potluck (the whole thing disappeared by the end of the night). Definitely one that I'll make again!"
410005,64355,2010-10-21,5,"mmmm this is the best....I have made this sooo many times and my husband and I go through this in 2 sittings....the only thing I did was cut the apples in smaller chunks, everything was perfect on this!!!!!   would not change anything about this."
860079,259841,2009-12-22,5,"This is WONDERFULLY delicious ~ I made it for gifts and put it in little decorative Christmas tins. I'm wondering if the recipe could use a bit less butter though, as it seemed very greasy when it was finished cooling. I took the crunch out and set it on a paper towel (before I broke it apart) ~ it absorbed quite a bit of grease. It DID NOT taste greasy, but it was mighty slippery before I 'blotted' it. So when I make this again tonight :D I will cut the butter a bit. Wonderful flavor and a huge hit with the DH. Thanks PrimQuilter ~ made for ZAAR COOKBOOK TAG, December 2009!"
149363,152441,2006-01-20,5,"Well I was looking for a different way to prepare carrots and saw this was recently posted. WOW!! Delicious! I love the addition of the brown sugar and ginger, they go together great with carrots. I will be making this one again.
Thanks Mama!"
229619,152441,2006-01-24,5,Yummy carrots!  We'll be having this again and again.
169969,152441,2006-01-26,5,These are wonderful!!! I love the flavors! It is as if ginger and brown sugar were invented just for carrots!! Thanks Hope for a fabulous carrot recipe!
227831,152441,2006-01-28,5,"I also like to make carrots this way but I like to use fresh ginger root, about 1/2 to 1 tsp chopped fine.

I OFTEN make them in the microwave, which means you throw the above ingredients into a glass casserole along with about 1 T. water, cover it with plastic wrap, and micro cook for 6 to 8 minutes right when you are ready to serve."
89831,152441,2006-01-29,5,These are just delicious! I increased the brown sugar slightly. Thanks mama!...Kitten:)
131807,152441,2006-01-30,5,"This is a great recipe. I think next time, I may increase the brown sugar a little bit, but was definitely great as is. Thanks for posting. "
293086,152441,2006-02-16,5,"I made this tonight.  It is my favorite way of making carrots (although in a crockpot with a roast is pretty good too.)

Good: easy:  a way of getting some vegetables!"
86764,152441,2006-03-02,5,"Another rave for you, Hope.  Missy (next door neighbor) came over and asked me if I knew how to make glazed carrots.  This is the only recipe I ever use, but haven't rated it (I'm a lazy bones sometimes!)  She gave it a rave, but left out the ginger because she didn't have any.  Said it was just like the school's (which she loves - our school had good food!).  Rylee (her DD) also gobbled these up...well, part of them.  The other part ended up in the floor, on the high chair, and in her hair.  :D"
278113,152441,2006-03-03,5,"I was leary of the ginger when I first read this recipe. But, with all the rave reviews I had to see for myself. And it is REALLY good!!! I will never make them any other way again! Thanks for a fantastic recipe."
129992,152441,2006-03-12,5,Yummy! Nice light ginger taste...I'll make these again!
217726,152441,2006-03-22,4,The taste of the carrots were good and it is easy to make. I guess with all the 5 star ratings I was excepting a little more yumminess!
244817,152441,2006-03-23,5,I had this for lunch today. It was very good. This is one of the few ways that I like to carrots. Good Basic recipe. Thanks for posting!
274866,152441,2006-03-23,4,"Yummy recipe, will make again! Will probably try with less ginger."
239229,152441,2006-05-06,5,"These carrots were soo delicious!!! I usually dread eating carrots because of a bitter flavor, but this recipe made them easy to eat! I now OFFICIALLY LOVE carrots! Thanks so much for submitting this recipe! Will make again and again!"
65720,152441,2006-06-21,5,"These were delicious! What a nice accent the ginger provides and it pairs so well with the carrot flavor. I halved the recipe, since there were just the two of us and used Sugar Twin brown sugar substitute and light butter without adversely affecting the quality of the recipe.Thanks, Mama, for posting this- we'll enjoy it often!"
209255,152441,2006-06-27,5,"My Mom used to add brown sugar and butter to her carrots so I do it as well now.  But I had never added ginger!  WOW!  That gives it a delightful flavour.  There is just enough ginger in there that you don't really ""taste"" it, it is just there.  Perfect!  Thanks!"
205100,152441,2006-08-17,5,HUGE hit in my family!  I make these several times a month. My daughter will not eat any other kind of cooked carrots. Awesome.
269198,152441,2006-09-22,5,These are so yummy! The ginger really helps them out. I also like to add some cinnamon. I've also substituted orange juice for the butter. Less fat.  
230258,152441,2006-09-24,5,"These carrots are definatley 24k!!! The ginger you couldn't really taste which made this recipe have a unique flavor. I loves it and I can't believe how simple it was!
Thanks for the recipe mama's kitchen!"
329056,152441,2006-10-01,4,"These carrots were delicious. The sauce was yummy. The taste of the sauce didn't really infuse itself into the carrots, but when I re-dipped the carrots in it... YUM! I mixed the sauce into some rice I had, and you should definitely try it. Good stuff."
57162,152441,2006-10-02,4,Made last night for family.  My seven year old asked for seconds.  I did double the sauce as I didn't think the first batch made enough.  Great recipe - a keeper for sure!
98336,152441,2006-10-23,5,"This was an easy recipe- and believe it or not-- my 8yo daughter (non-veggie eater) even asked for a second helping of carrots! 

OK, so I said there was caramel sauce on them...  I used chopped ginger from a jar..  Definately a keeper!"
138429,152441,2006-11-06,5,  We loved these carrots. I do like ginger and the balance of the ingredients was perfect. So very easy to make and  with  such great flavorI served them with pork chops and  brown rice. They will be a great addition come holiday time. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
356062,152441,2006-11-15,5,I can not thank you enough for this recipe! My father who has not been able to eat much and has zero appetite because of his illness had more that half of this recipe!!!!!! That says A LOT about these carrots. I had to whip up another batch so my whole family could have some with their dinner. Thank you thank you!
222055,152441,2006-11-30,4,I made these for dh as a quick side for his work lunch (Spam and mustard sandwiches). He loved them and said they complimented the sandwiches well. He also said it made carrots much more enjoyable to eat. I love how easy they are to cook and I used the microwave suggestion of another review to steam the carrots. I let dh do the rating as I am not the carrot lover. My little one still preferred them raw. Thank you mama's kitchen !!!
126104,152441,2006-12-02,5,"I totally enjoyed these.  Not only were they simple, but delicious.  I might try fresh ginger the next time, because I love an intense ginger flavor, but these are a winner just as they are.

I just upped the stars.  I saved a small amount of these and reheated them after 3-4 days.  I liked them even better.  I had them tonite with just a simple pot pie."
142559,152441,2006-12-03,4,"Fantastic carrots! Served at a Christmas party and they were a hit! I personally don't care for carrots, but did find these very good!  Super easy to make - no baking! LOL! I steamed these and then tossed in the sauce."
405313,152441,2006-12-17,5,"I made these yummy carrots for a holiday dinner party we had last night and they were a huge hit. My mother-in-law especially enjoyed them. :) It must be the ginger in this recipe that really makes it special. I will definately be doing carrots this way again. Thanks, mama's kitchen!"
59473,152441,2006-12-19,5,These carrots were great. The ginger added a nice flavour. Like another reviewer I cooked them in the microwave. Thanks
394077,152441,2007-01-08,5,Delish and so easy to do. Thank you mama for the recipe
248772,152441,2007-01-24,2,"Not our favorite...kids did not like and they love carrots, but I think it is a adult food. Thanks for sharing."
359220,152441,2007-01-31,0,"I think I need to rate this without stars, as I left out the ground ginger (I think mine wasn't up to par).  But boy or boy, you can't beat tender carrots with brown sugar and butter...I think I ate this entire recipe myself over a day or two!!!  Yum!"
446610,152441,2007-02-09,5,Made these to go with the kids' lunch today.  I have used a similiar recipe in the past that had honey in place of the brown sugar and I think we prefer it your way.  YUM!
309368,152441,2007-03-11,4,Simple and tasty!
168416,152441,2007-03-29,0,"These had good flavor, BUT, I did not rate them because I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and microwaved them. I have never done that before and DO NOT recommend it. The first batch I made using the directions given in the review resulted in horribly shriveled and overcooked carrots. The second batch, I halved the amount of cooking time and still they came out shriveled and overcooked but somewhat edible. However, as I stated before, the flavor was still good. So, next time I will go back to making them via stovetop and I'm sure I will love them!"
129031,152441,2007-04-16,4,"great flavor, I steamed them also. very tasty."
58836,152441,2007-04-17,5,"Yum, I love carrots and these were very good.  I didn't add the ginger and they were just as good.  Thanks, I'm sur4 I will make again."
458309,152441,2007-04-17,4,"We loved these carrots!  I steamed them using my steamer, then just coated with the sauce.  Fast and easy! Thanks for posting."
487248,152441,2007-04-20,5,These carrots were so yummy! Full of flavor. We will be making these again!!
274719,152441,2007-05-01,5,"For not being a big of carrots, I sure gobbled these down quick.  I used honey flavored butter instead of regular and fresh ginger instead of dried.  I will be making this again and again!"
295565,152441,2007-05-21,1,I followed this recipe exactly and there was absolutely no flavour.  Sorry.  Didn't like it.  :(
227607,152441,2007-05-25,5,Made these for ZWT 07...The kids loved them and want me to make them again tomorrow.  Very yummy way to get the kids to eat their carrots.  I think I used a little more brown sugar than called for.
219318,152441,2007-05-27,4,"These were quick and easy to throw together, and I thought the butter and ginger flavors came through very well.  It needed more brown sugar though.  But that might have been my fault.  I wasn't sure whether to firmly pack the brown or not, so I measured it somewhere in between.   Made for Zaar World Tour III."
394604,152441,2007-05-28,5,"I have made these little beauties a couple of times so far. They taste great. I used baby carrots the first time and regular sliced carrots the second. The ginger makes the recipe, in my opinion. They are mighty tasty and I think the kiddies would like these, too."
223854,152441,2007-05-28,5,"I made this for *Zaar World Tour III*
I sliced the carrots in half and baked them in the oven for 40 mins at 190oC and when they were finished cooking I poured the ""dressing"" over the carrots.  They tasted wonderful, Little Miss (DD) really enjoyed them she wanted second serving.  Thank you Mama's Kitchen for posting your recipe"
222478,152441,2007-05-29,5,These were fantasic! Had both a slightly caramelised and sweet taste from the sugar and the ginger just really set things off.
231054,152441,2007-05-29,5,"So simple, but so, so good.  I didn't double the sauce -- but I think I was a little short on the amount of carrots I used, so it worked fine.  But if I have the entire pound of carrots, I think I'll do as others suggested and double the sauce -- it's certainly yummy enough to have double the amount!!!"
183964,152441,2007-05-30,5,A very nice dish. There's a lot of flavor here! These went along very nicely with Charmies corned beef brisket. I cooked the carrots in the brisket broth and the pickling spice added a very nice flavor. A perfect side for your next corned beef meal. Try them!
324621,152441,2007-05-30,4,These were pretty good. Made them to go with our steak and shrimp dinner along with some seasoned pasta and fresh honeydew melon. Very nice meal and these carrots were a lovely addition!
222139,152441,2007-05-30,5,Excellant!  You can make this dish in no time.  Well worth trying.
507233,152441,2007-06-01,5,Best carrots I have EVER had.  PERIOD!
361931,152441,2007-06-01,5,"I have been looking a long time for a good glazed carrot recipe -- and have found it!  My little carrot expert (2 year old son) LOVED them, as did hubby and myself.  Picky daughter even said they were good and she would eat some next time -- since she waited until after dinner to actually taste them."
275438,152441,2007-06-07,5,I don't like cooked carrots but this made them great!!  We will definitely be eating more carrots!  I doubled the sauce like suggested but probably could have just done normal.  Thanks for posting!
265954,152441,2007-06-08,5,"Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.  So delicious, quick and simple, and leaves your kitchen smelling like the sweet scent of ginger.  Note:  sugar burns quickly, so be sure to heat the sugar over low heat and stir often.  Thanks for posting."
199848,152441,2007-06-14,5,"Sweet with a hint of ginger.  Just perfect.  These are great for kids and ""grown-up"" enough for adults.  I may have used a bit extra ginger; I didn't measure it.  Thanx for sharing this.  I'll be making these again."
353579,152441,2007-06-17,5,"This has plenty of great reviews, but I'll chime in with one more.  I make glazed carrots often, but the addition of just a bit of ginger sets this apart and I'll definitely add it next time I make them.  Thanks for sharing, mama!"
505325,152441,2007-06-22,5,"Mama, these are absolutely great!  I mixed the sauce separately and poured it over the sliced carrots which I had in a glass bowl, covered it with plastic wrap as recommended by MollyJ, and microwaved it 6 minutes.  Perfection...."
107135,152441,2007-06-25,5,great carrots  the ground ginger is inspired
74652,152441,2007-06-29,4,This is the way my Mother always made carrots and now the way I make them.  Always a must on the Thanksgiving and Easter table!  Thanks for sharing!
261510,152441,2007-06-29,5,I can't make carrots any other way now!  So easy and great flavor.  I steamed the carrots then added them to the mixture.  They were loved by all.  Thanks!
103876,152441,2007-07-01,5,Very good carrots!  This recipe is simple to make and the flavor of the sauce really compliments the carrots.  I used baby carrots and fresh ginger.  My daughter was still eating the leftovers after dinner was over.  I think that's a good sign!
130663,152441,2007-07-05,5,"Love it,,Will make again"
442988,152441,2007-07-05,4,"Very good.  It was a bit too sweet for my tastes -- I found the natural sugar in the carrots didn't need that much extra richness.  Next time I'll cut the sugar/butter glaze in half for the same amount of carrots, so it's just the slightest hint of extra sweetness.  Thanks for a good recipe!"
20480,152441,2007-07-07,5,"I served these carrots with my meal last night.What a great surprise; we loved them.I made them for Zingo; thanks for posting.
Rita"
352845,152441,2007-07-16,5,"When your teenagers ask for carrots with dinner, you know you've got a winner.  Great recipe!"
140132,152441,2008-01-26,5,My family loved these. What a great idea to add the ginger.  I feel that is what makes this dish so special.  Its that wow factor.  Thank you for posting this simple side dish that is sure to please....Stephanie
250031,152441,2008-01-27,4,Family liked them! We don't eat carrots much but everyone liked these so I'm adding them to the family menu.
339260,152441,2007-07-23,5,"These carrots are superb!  I had a 1 lb bag of baby carrots left over from a veggie tray I made for by DIL's baby shower.  I did an ingredient search for carrots to find a different way to use these up.  I like glazed carrots and I like ginger.  When I read this recipe, I knew I couldn't go wrong.  I use an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  These were the best glazed carrots that I have ever had.  The ginger and the brown sugar are a wonderful combination.  I am putting this recipe in my binder of ""special"" recipes.  I would like to try these with fresh, grated ginger root as some of the others suggested.  Thanks for another amazing recipem, mama!"
344069,152441,2007-08-13,4,A great way to get a toddler to eat his carrots!  Yummy!
559316,152441,2007-08-16,4,Made this for dinner tonight. Went over well. I doubled the sauce. Thanks for posting!
573224,152441,2007-08-28,4,Very good! I used fresh ginger that I minced but I didnt taste it at all in the end. The sauce was still very good though!!
547357,152441,2007-08-31,5,Very very good!
281132,152441,2007-09-01,5,oh these are sooooooooo good. i just prepared them today prior to a family gathering tomorrow. i was intending to heat them quickly in the microwave tomorrow. and guess what? i've eaten the lot of them. for sure i am making these often.  thanks for a lovely recipe - i am sure my kids will be encouraged to eat healthily with these (thats if i leave them any). Great!!!
566275,152441,2007-09-04,5,Simplicity itself.  Would probably increase the ginger next time.
473347,152441,2007-09-11,5,"Wow! This was amazing. I can't stand ginger normally but this converted me. I steamed the carrots and whipped up some rice. And I mixed the rice and coated carrots together. A great, filling, fairly healthy meal (better than the potato chips I was going to eat). For a little kick I added some crushed red peppers. I will take this recipe with me when I head off to college."
494068,152441,2007-10-04,5,"I make these all the time, only use cinnamon instead of the ginger.  Always a hit in my house.  Thanks!"
332670,152441,2007-10-05,5,"These carrots are definitely yummy! My son who is 3 1/2 does not like carrots,but he sure did like these. Even my 16 year old like them. I will be making these a lot. Thank you so much for posting."
467341,152441,2007-10-14,5,I love carrots and this was a great recipe.
13483,152441,2007-10-17,5,Excellent veggie dish.  I made the dish a day ahead of my dinner party and just gently nuked it to warm it up.  Worked like a charm.  Added a nice colour to the plate and a good taste to the pallet.  Thanks for the post mama's kitchen.
88569,152441,2007-10-18,4,"These were good, the rest of the family liked them better than I did. I think next time I will add a bit more brown sugar and only use 1/4 t. of ginger (I usually like ginger but the taste was quite strong). Great twist on carrots, thanks!"
446738,152441,2007-11-18,5,Very tasty!  I added just a little bit of kosher salt for a little more flavor.  Husband and daughter loved them.
173880,152441,2007-11-23,5,Made this as part of our Thanksgiving dinner! Thanks!!
68023,152441,2007-11-26,4,Not too bad!  I was skeptical but it really does have a nice flavor!  (Make sure you cut down the ingredients in the sauce if you don't have as many carrots.)
305531,152441,2007-12-06,5,What can I say that hasn't been said already? These are really yummy and were the star of our dinner last night. I steamed the carrots ahead and heated them up right before dinner. Thanks Hope for a wonderful new side dish.
58104,152441,2007-12-11,5,"CANDY!!!!!
Yes this is like eating candy so buttery sweet!
 I used 1 1/2 pounds of carrots 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger, 2 tablespoons butter and brown sugar! I served with recipe #142483. Thanks Hope!"
591307,152441,2008-01-02,4,"Lovely recipe, and one I will be repeating often. I didn't use the ginger in my recipe.  Made for Christmas dinner and it went so well with my roast!  Loved this recipe.  Thank you Mama! Debbie"
61660,152441,2008-01-02,5,"Great carrots!  I used the last of the ones I had stored from our garden.  I sliced up regular orange carrots as well as white and purple carrots.  Very pretty together (the white carrots did pick up a little purple hue,lol).  Loved the sweetness of this recipe, it so enhanced the carrot flavor."
468146,152441,2008-01-10,4,"mama's kitchen, the carrots were tastely. After reading the reviews I used fresh ginger root and a little more brown sugar. I also added some cinnamon for extra flavor. It was a great way to sneak carrots in on the family."
8688,152441,2008-01-18,5,"Delicious simple and easy to put on your table!  Thanks, Mama's Kitchen!"
659588,152441,2008-01-24,5,"These were absolutely great.  Really enhances the natural sweetness of the carrots. Made them with little shatanay carrots, halved lengthways. I cooked 500g for my little boy and I, and we ate the lot! Ive passed the recipe onto my friend whos little boy has an aversion to veg, with the promise ""he WILL eat these!"" :o) thank you very very much for the recipe."
352738,152441,2008-01-30,5,Rave reviews from my family this last Easter.  I was looking for soemthing simple and just a little different but not so much so fussy eaters wouldn't try it.  This was a real winner and really fit the bill.  I had many requests for the recipe and have had them ask for it again.  Think I will add to my Easter menu every year thank you!
191533,152441,2008-02-05,5,"Superb! The flavor is great! I like a thicker sauce that sticks to the carrots, so I blend in a little mixture of cornstarch and water after the other sauce ingredients. Delicious; thanks for sharing!"
130133,152441,2008-02-05,5,"This is so good, and it is simple to prepare!  My husband raved about the carrots.  Thanks for sharing!"
68960,152441,2008-02-09,4,These are nice.  Easy to make and went well with our lamb shanks. My brown sugar didn't melt that well even though the pan was low.
731434,152441,2008-02-10,4,These are sweet like lollies!
355058,152441,2008-02-10,4,These are sweet and yummy!
202431,152441,2008-03-12,1,Looks like I am definately in the minority here. I followed the recipe exactly and even steamed the carrots hoping to lock in the flavor but the end result was not at all what I expected... just simply had no taste. Sorry but I won't be making these again.
369715,152441,2008-03-12,4,These are good and easy to make. I used canned carrots as that is all I had tonight and needed a quick side dish. I followed the recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed these. Thanks for a different way to make carrots.
587114,152441,2008-03-31,5,"It's all been said already, wonderful carrots! Even my 6 year old ate them up!  For the Freezer Tag game, these carrots froze beautifully.  I added about a teaspoon of water to the finished product, stuck them in the freezer, and thawed and reheated them later."
332211,152441,2008-04-03,4,"Ginger really gives the carrots a little zip.  Hesitant to try, but so glad I did."
389431,152441,2008-04-07,4,"Good down home kinda flavor. Sweet, but not candied...  you could still taste the carrot! I will be using this one again! Thanks!"
675287,152441,2008-04-08,5,"Made these along with corned beef and cabbage.  They went great!  The only change I made was to use cinnamon instead of the ginger.  Simple, quick and delicious!  Thank you Mama for this one!"
537188,152441,2008-04-19,5,This is such a nice way to prepare carrots : it's so simple and yet...so tasty!
377581,152441,2008-04-21,4,"These were nice for a change!Easy to make and tasty. A subtle change to the usual carrot taste. I felt there was too much glaze, so next time I'll reduce the butter and sugar by half, but keep the ginger just as is. Thank you for such a simple flavorful recipe! I'll be making these again."
538098,152441,2008-05-16,4,"Quick, easy, and a nice change of pace."
125640,152441,2008-07-19,3,"Simple sweet, buttery side dish. If nothing else, good basic microwave carrots. Incredibly easy to make in just minutes without taking up space on the stove. I thought they tasted pretty good. DH didn't like them, but we both prefer raw carrots anyway. Thanks for sharing."
638072,152441,2008-07-30,3,Well I had to try this after reading it comes from Texas!  I was born and bred there.  I didnt like the sweet in the recipe.  I think Im just a salty veg kinda person.  But thats just me!!  Thanks!
422609,152441,2008-08-01,4,These were delicious!  Our new favorite way of preparing carrots as a side dish.
399657,152441,2008-08-05,5,Nuked and eyeballed everything using baby carrots.  Doesn't get much easier than that!
383206,152441,2008-09-15,2,"I was going to make this for Thanksgiving based on all of the amazing reviews, but I am so happy that I tested the recipe first.  I followed the recipe exactly, and he ginger was not at all complimentary to the carrots. We love carrots and these actually got tossed. I am sorry, I guess this is just not suited to our taste at all."
288351,152441,2008-09-16,4,"I made it according to the recipe.  Everyone liked it, but I thought it would have been better without as much (or any) ginger."
801264,152441,2008-09-27,5,Yummy! The portion of dressing to carrots is perfect. The flavors complemented the carrots very nicely. I steamed my carrots on the top rack of my rice cooker for 15min and they came out perfect. Thanks again!
29404,152441,2008-12-08,5,"Who Knew!  Just a little touch of ginger and what a treat.  I had to halve the recipe, used carrots on hand.  They got done b4 the rest of dinner, and I finally gave up the charade and just left a fork in them, a bite here, a bite there.  Ty for posting.  This goes to my Do Again list."
134624,152441,2008-12-10,4,"These were quite tasty. I steamed the whole baby carrots in a bamboo steamer, and served the carrots with smoked turkey drumsticks, and Buttery Parmesan Rice #201142.
The recipe was made as directed, using freshly grated ginger. I will probably make these again, with no changes."
55578,152441,2008-12-18,4,Good!  I like the addition of ginger.
495032,152441,2008-12-19,4,Tasty.  Thank you.
674484,152441,2008-12-26,5,These were a nice side dish to my dinner of Recipe #126492.  We had with mashed potatoes and  Recipe #261418.  What a delicious combination it was!
868673,152441,2009-01-05,5,These went great with my roast and mashed potatoes over the holidays.  Everyone enjoyed the sweetness and flavors from the brown sugar glaze.  I will use this recipe when I feel like making fresh carrots.  They were great for all of us!  Roni
768828,152441,2009-01-25,5,"I love these carrots.  I've made several times and can't belive I didn't review.  I usually use Smart Balance instead of butter, but are still really good.  Thanks"
362983,152441,2009-02-04,5,"Yummy! I always use carrots with other vegetables, so it was nice to use just carrots and make something very simple yet tasty at the same time! I sliced my carrots and sauteed them till they softened. A bit of water helped them along as well. I think I'll probably add more ground ginger next time since I think I added a touch less than recommended, or try fresh ginger for a nice little kick. I might microwave the carrots next time like other reviews have suggested and see how it compares time-wise. Hmm maybe some honey instead of brown sugar.. or even some herbs. Oh the possibilities.. :) Thanks for a lovely recipe!"
622972,152441,2009-03-22,5,These were good!  My hubby even ate a few and he hates carrots.
544754,152441,2009-06-02,4,"This was different from how I usually season my carrots, so it was nice. I liked the sweetness from the brown sugar, and the ginger taste in the background was subtle. I steamed this in the microwave according to MollyJ's tips and it turned out perfectly. Thanks!"
719083,152441,2009-06-19,5,This is how we like to cook our carrots and is my favorite type of carrots. We don't normally put ginger in but I had some so I chopped up finely (as MollyJ mentioned) and used that in there. This is just a nice easy way to give carrots some flavor. Thanks!
98761,152441,2009-06-22,5,I served this tonight to company along with a turkey dinner.  I enjoyed the carrots fixed this way.  Thank you.
577723,152441,2009-06-22,5,"I cooked the carrots in the microwave 1st, in a Ziploc ""Zip & Steam"" bag.  I do have to cut the cooking time in half or veggies will overcook. They were great!"
951589,152441,2009-07-06,5,"mmmm delicious!!!  I cooked mine in boiling water until they were soft and tender, then tossed them in the sauce.  I did add a litte extra brown sugar :)"
395940,152441,2009-07-13,5,"Really good variation on carrots!  Delicious, but not too sweet."
987323,152441,2009-07-28,5,My boyfriend and I thought these were great!  They were sweet and buttery.  This is such an awesome way to spice up ordinary carrots!
1049724,152441,2009-08-26,5,"I followed Mama's recipe and found that I prefer the less saucy version - to keep it healthy. The kids liked it, it was easy to make - I steamed baby carrots, then mixed them into a bowl with the brown sugar, butter and ground ginger.  Because the butter was not melted yet, I mixed what I could and then added the hot carrots, which then dissolved and turned the mix into the sauce.  I will be making this again."
633027,152441,2009-10-04,5,Very yummy!  Made these to go with dinner last night.  I used 1/2 lb of the frozen crinkle cut carrots.  I kept the sauce ingredients at 2 tbsp brown sugar and 2 tbsp margarine but decreased the ginger to 1/4 tsp which was plenty for my family's tastes. I'll definitely  increase the sauce ingredients in the future to make it more 'saucy' though.  I also think next time I'll try subbing cinnamon for the ginger because my family likes cinnamon on carrots and I think it will work well with this method.  Thanks for posting!!!!!!!!
158086,152441,2009-11-15,5,These were excellent carrots..I used splenda brown sugar and will be making these for our annual family xmas dinner at our Uncles...They will go perfect with his ham...thanks
353485,152441,2009-11-28,4,Super easy and got rave reviews from my guests though I thought they were quite sweet (made as written.)  Everyone at the table commented favorably on the ginger taste and one of my guests even asked to take the leftovers home; that alone is enough to ensure that this recipe will be made again.
1007259,152441,2009-12-02,0,"I cooked these a bit differently - mixed up the butter, sugar, and ginger, tossed raw carrots in it, and roasted them.  Maybe ground ginger doesn't hold up well to the heat, but I couldn't really taste it at all.  Since it might be my fault, I won't rate it, but I wanted to warn anyone else hoping to roast carrots this way."
1046155,152441,2009-12-13,5,"These are fabulous! My fiance bought a huge bag of baby carrots and I needed to find a way to fix them. Neither of us particularly like cooked carrots, but these are the exception! I steamed the carrots and microwaved the butter, brown sugar and ground ginger for 30 seconds. Then, I drained the water from the pan, added the carrots and sauce and voila! A ridiculously easy, DELICIOUS one-pot side! The ginger flavor isn't obvious, but gives these something extra."
126618,152441,2009-12-15,5,"Super Yummy!
My 5 year old ate all of the carrots on her plate.
My 3 year old asked for more.  When everyone was done I polished off the bowl. I will make these again."
1102065,152441,2009-12-28,5,This was an awesome recipe.  The flavors blended nicely.  I steamed the carrots first.  Thank you!
1239933,152441,2009-12-28,5,"What a yummy recipe! Totally simple and utterly delicious! My daughters (ages 5 and 3) both asked for second helpings, and my husband has asked me to make them again tonight! Thanks for posting!"
1200137,152441,2009-12-31,5,I steamed the carrots and they were very moist and flavorful! Yumm
221139,152441,2010-01-03,5,Very good!  Enhances carrots without masking their flavor.
329638,152441,2010-01-16,5,Very tasty!  Kids loved it. Thanks for posting!
653438,152441,2010-01-23,5,I saw this recipe this morning and just had to say I fix my carrots this way quite often only I use some fresh grated ginger...DH and I love these!  Thank you for posting.
1365025,152441,2010-01-28,5,"These are so good. I steamed my baby carrots first and then finished simmering them in this delicious sauce. I'm just cooking for one but I always make enough for two meals, shame on me but I ate all the carrots in one meal, that's how good they are."
384657,152441,2010-02-15,4,"I was hesitant to try this, b/c I usually don't care for sugar of any sort on any vegetables.  But we were glad I gave it a try.  The ginger gave it a nice kick and I will make it again.  I will probably cut back on the sugar next time though, just a little bit.  All in all, a nice recipe.  Thanks."
468351,152441,2010-03-18,5,Quick and delicious!
1348747,152441,2010-03-22,5,"A super easy, very yummy side dish."
173579,152441,2010-03-23,5,These are very tasty carrots and so easy to fix.  My family just loved them.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
333017,152441,2010-04-01,5,I have made something similar to this but used mustard instead of the ginger.  I quite liked the ginger/butter combination. I made this up the day ahead of time...undercooked the carrots a bit and placed them in the crockpot for about an hour.  Loved it!!  I will definately use this recipe again!!
415084,152441,2010-04-22,4,Great flavor. I used fresh carrots from the farmers market and sliced them instead of baby carrots. The ginger is the darling in this dish.
590640,152441,2010-04-23,4,"These were very good. I wasn't sure how my family was going to like the ginger, but my husband liked them and my 3 year old daughter ate all of hers! I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!"
355637,152441,2010-04-29,3,These were pretty good!
1437646,152441,2010-05-14,4,"I had to omit the ginger, because I have picky eaters and it still turned out great. The only other thing i did differently was to add a pinch of salt during cooking. I cookrd mine in the microwave, but added enough water so that at least 3/4 of the carrots were submerged."
184890,152441,2010-05-30,5,Perfect Carrot dish recipe.  Definitely 24k.  I substituted 2T orange juice for the butter  and also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Excellent taste.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
465829,152441,2010-06-03,5,"Most of the family really liked this. DH even took the leftover sauce and poured it over some ice cream with bananas for instant bananas foster dessert. I did add a small dash of cinnamon, just because that smelled right. My DD and I still agree that even with a sweet sugar coating, carrots are the most vile, evil vegetable ever created. ;) I will be making this again. One day, I may even taste it! Thanks! :)"
50969,152441,2010-06-20,4,"UPDATE On 6/20/10: I've made these carrots so many times and can't believe I've never posted a photo. Well, I've made these again and here's the photo. And I have to say they are just as good if not better than the first time they were made. My first time to review this recipe was November 3rd,2006
I just want to say that my SO and I really enjoyed these carrots very much.I thought that the ginger and brown sugar gave the dish that ""something special""that is usually missing from carrots.These will be made again,Thank you for posting."
228963,152441,2010-08-16,5,This was a simple and easy recipe to make. My entire family loved this. I will be making again soon. Thank you for posting!!!!
74281,152441,2010-11-16,5,"These are definitely delicious carrots and SO simple to make. I used a bag of baby carrots and just threw all of the ingredients into a pot with 1 cup of water. Then I brought it to a boil, covered the pan and reduced the heat to a simmer. I simmered the carrots covered for 15 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes until the sauce was reduced. My 80 year old Dad looked at the plate and said: ""CARROTS? YUK!"" I told him to just try 'em, and he did.... He then requested seconds!"
1154939,152441,2011-02-03,4,"Nice blend of flavors! My husband is not fond of carrots, but ate these and enjoyed them. My 5 yr old daughter liked them too. I did cut the ginger in half. They weren't too sweet and not too buttery. I'll definitely make them again."
633761,152441,2011-02-15,5,"Not that you need another 5 star review, but this recipe is super yummy!!  I'm not normally a huge fan of sweetened veggies, but the brown sugar and ginger was a great combo.  Even got my 4yo veggie hater to clean his plate!  That's saying something.  I melted the butter, brown sugar and ginger in a serving dish in the microwave. Then just added my boiled, sliced carrots and tossed to combine. Thank you for the great recipe!"
1832505,152441,2011-02-21,5,"Though I had to substitute ground ginger for fresh grated, these were delicious! I'll be making them again!"
75890,152441,2011-04-10,4,"I really liked these carrots and so did MOST of the family.  My husband only likes carrots that have been cooked to death, so that might attribute why he was not a fan.  I used fresh ginger as I had some on hand."
1084369,152441,2011-05-30,4,"I also steamed my carrots and then tossed them with sauce. Additionally, I reduced the sugar and butter by a tiny bit - still yummy, not too strongly flavored to scare off those who aren't exactly ginger fans."
344087,152441,2011-07-30,5,Thank you!!! I hated cooked carrots until now. Temporary following a low residue diet and need to eat well cooked or canned vegetables with no skin. I had some canned ones in the pantry that I knew I should use or donate. I made the sauce in a small skillet and tossed the drained carrots and heated till warm. I also added a little sauce to my plain white rice and it was very nice for a change. This would be great for the microwave or to make camping as it is super easy!!!
1530179,152441,2011-08-29,4,"Delicious carrots and very simple to make.  Similar to Sooz Cooks I tossed the ingrediants in a pot with a cup of water, brought to boil and reduced heat to low, everything was done in 15 minutes, I still like my carrots to have a little firmness to them and not be mushy.  Very easy!"
132010,152441,2011-10-17,5,I tried it and we loved it!  Very simple and I doubled the recipe. I steamed the carrots and then mixed in the sauce.  Very good.  Thanks for posting.
207257,152441,2011-12-25,4,pretty yummy and very easy!
316809,152441,2011-12-26,5,"Loved this very simple and elegant dish for Christmas dinner last night! The ginger really made the dish. I microwaved the sauce, but next time I'll do it on the stove. Everyone loved these! Thanks for a great recipe!"
928301,152441,2012-04-27,3,It was ok.  Needed to try to thicken the sauce on the heat a bit more.
1581225,152441,2012-07-29,4,Very sweet and tasty.
2378234,152441,2012-09-30,4,"these were amazing, simple to make and will definitely be done again.<br/><br/>I actually boiled them like Sooz Cooks suggested. Loved them!"
2474725,152441,2012-11-01,5,Yummm the ginger is perfect.
348926,152441,2012-11-23,5,"Needed one more vegetable for Thanksgiving, something quick, easy, tasty; this was it!  Thank you for posting."
175727,152441,2013-01-15,5,IF I could give this a 10 I would.. perfectly balanced sweetness and the ginger is SO perfect here!<br/><br/>Will use for tonight - St. Patrick's with our corned beef.<br/><br/>1/2013  Adding that these canned so well!!!!<br/>a
2661620,152441,2013-02-04,5,"Simple elegance! I sliced the carrots, then steamed them for 10 min, added other ingredients to the carrots with some carrot water, reduced sauce on medium heat for 5-10 minutes. This is a PERFECT side dish."
2742639,152441,2013-04-25,0,"Thank you, we never loved carrots!!! But now its a different story they are so sweet I have made them now 4 times, and my hubby loves them."
851405,152441,2013-04-29,4,"My oldest son and oldest daughter and I liked these.  My two younger sons and husband wouldn&#039;t even try them-they were, after all, carrots."
628076,152441,2013-10-21,4,Pretty tasty ... I did reduce the ginger by half but I will try if full strength next time. Thanks the hubs and kids liked them
486718,152441,2014-05-22,0,Yummy way to make carrots!  Thanks!!!
176615,152441,2015-01-07,5,Really good. Super fast and easy to fix. Thanks for the recipe!
165933,152441,2015-01-19,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  I have made it twice now, first with brown sugar and the second time with maple syrup sugar!  Both were a hit with everyone.  Thanks."
661864,152441,2015-01-30,4,"Delicious as is. Also very good using half parsnips, half carrots."
198154,152441,2015-03-08,3,"I made these for DH, as is the only one who likes cooked carrots in our house. He gave them 3 stars. He said they were &quot;okay&quot; and &quot;not bad, but not his favorite.&quot; Lots of leftovers."
2000335947,152441,2015-07-13,5,"I loved the recipe the way it came out. Its was awesome and my whole family loved it. Easy and tasty, thank you :) It tasted amazing with chicken and mayonnaise salad."
1949845,152441,2017-04-17,4,"I have made these twice in the last two weeks &amp; believe I'm onto something. The first time I made it &quot;as is&quot; with the addition of just a little cinnamon (plus the ginger called for in the recipe). The second time when I made it for Easter, I doubled the recipe but didn't double the butter (still adding the touch of cinnamon). I think I liked it better the second time because the sauce was thicker. Will definitely make again."
377366,152441,2017-06-13,5,"As a full time working mom, wife, etc. no time for steaming, washing pots &amp; all that entails. Cook carrots in microwave 3-5 minutes. Melt butter, add brown sugar &amp; ginger, parsley for color. A little salt to enhance flavor. Done in less than 10 minutes. One dish, minimum clean up. Simple, easy, healthy."
218535,152441,2017-10-15,2,too sweet
107583,188540,2008-01-16,5,Just got a juicer and this recipe is going to be made often.  Was a great afterwork pick-me-up.  Reminded me of V-8 without the acid of the tomatoes.
724631,188540,2011-05-30,3,"My drink demonstrated that a VitaMix is not a juicer; to produce a drink, I had to add 1/2 cup of water and added ice cubes to chill.  My rating is based on the taste.  The mixture didn't taste bad, but it tasted much better when I added some pitted fresh cherries for a slight sweet taste, hence 3 stars.  From what I read this afternoon, if your digestive system is compromised, you will lose a lot of nutrition from the retained fiber in the VitaMix ""Total Juice""; fiber-free juice will release nutrients directly to the bloodstream.  Made for 1-2-3 Hits tag."
74652,61155,2003-09-09,5,I added 1/2 cup chopped tomato and turned them into BLT pinwheels and they were fabulous!  Everyone loves the little appetizers!  Thanks :)
64934,61155,2003-10-16,5,"I made these pinwheels as an appetizer on Thanksgiving!  Boy, were they good!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, but next time I may add some chopped tomatoes.  These little appetizers were gone in no time!"
92385,61155,2004-06-30,5,"My husband loved these, and I do agree with him that they are delicious. I prepared them just as described, but cut each ""roll"" into 7 or 8 pieces, and also cut off and discarded the uneven ends. They are pretty and were well-appreciated by my guests. Thanks for posting !"
128950,61155,2004-07-15,4,"I used chive cream cheese and also added tomato and they were delicious.  One problem though, I made them several hours in advance and the lettuce got soggy.  But it didn't stop every last one from being eaten!"
19683,61155,2004-08-29,5,"Have been accused of trying to make my co workers fat with all of the testing I have been doing.  These were great as written and with tomatoes as suggested.  The third time I mised a little ranch dressing with the cream cheese.   Another dimension!
Thank you!
Margie"
192623,61155,2006-12-19,5,This was very easy and sooo good!  I made a double batch of them and just put all of the bacon in the oven to bake it - so much easier!  Very good for a party - will try it w/ tomatoes next time for a BLT pinwheel.  Thanks for sharing Fluffy!
141569,456850,2011-05-26,5,The kids loved this sweet dessert.  They asked for more immediately. What a hit!
852554,456850,2011-05-31,5,"Yummy!! I love frozen bananas!!  Didn't add very much sugar as my bananas were REALLY ripe (like almost ready for banana bread!).  Next time, I might add in a little PB or mix in some mini chocolate chips!"
679953,456850,2011-07-09,5,"Lessened the suger a little, but other than that it made for a great dessert for us, kids especially since they love bananas.  Will make again.  Made for PRMR Tag."
2123645,456850,2017-05-01,5,"An easy, refreshing, and healthy treat!"
2001112929,456850,2018-06-26,0,"I made it with 25 calorie per cup cashew milk, and they taste great! No sugar was needed, the natural sweetness of the bananas did the trick."
14664,21332,2003-06-08,5,"My neighbors and I were having a cookout yesterday and I needed a quick and easy sauce for the ham steaks. Seeing as how this only had 3 ingredients I thought I'd give this a try. I'm glad I did too
for this really gave a nice taste to the ham that everyone loved. I used catsup with the mixture and it
really pleased me. I'll be using this again that's for sure. Anything this simple, fast and sweet deserves a 5 in my book! Thanks you for posting this little gem."
2001979407,392356,2018-02-07,5,Great
150317,392356,2009-09-30,5,This is how I make my bacon and the whole house does not smell like bacon and no splatters to clean up...thanks for sharing
1225333,392356,2009-10-02,5,"I've been cooking bacon this way since I saw the directions in the Washington Post in the early 1990's. Even my skeptical nephew who likes his bacon CRISPY was won over. And BEST of all the clean-up is minimal; no spattering all over the cooktop, no smoking from the skillet. If you save bacon grease for other uses, using the oven eliminates the worry of burnt fat. I lay the bacon slices on the grill pan (the one that comes with the oven) and cook at a little lower heat (350), turning halfway through (10-15 minutes per side). When just shy of done, I turn off the oven a crack the door; the bacon finishes and stays hot for serving.
I highly recommend this method; thanks anichka20 for sharing!!!!"
1366254,392356,2009-10-08,4,I add a bit of brown sugar to mine.. it adds a depth you wouldn't believe
485109,392356,2009-12-13,5,This is the healthiest way to cook bacon so it's my method of choice. I used foil to make the clean up easier. Thanks for reminding me how much I like bacon!
198757,392356,2010-01-12,5,"Here's a tip:  Crinkle the foil up a bit, then unfold it again before spreading it over the pan.  This creates divets that the grease can go into as it cooks."
1124554,392356,2010-01-15,5,You can't get much easier than this! I used this for a brunch for friends. It enabled me to talk to my friends rather than worry over a spattering fry pan. Thank you!
294455,392356,2010-02-08,5,"This is such a great idea!  No more messy floor and stove from frying bacon, no more trying to keep my kids away from the stove incase the bacon ""pops.""  I love this, it is the ONLY way I make bacon now.  I have found it cooks a little more even if I turn it a couple of times."
982333,392356,2011-01-29,5,I make my bacon this way too. I generally use a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil. I sometimes use the bacon grease to add a bit to my dressing that I put on my spinach salad. I preheat my oven to 425 and cook for about 7 min. More or less depending on thickness of bacon.<br/><br/>To the user who put brown sugar on the bacon. I've done that also and you are right it's awesome!
231057,392356,2011-02-03,5,"I love to cook bacon in the oven...but please be careful.....I tried it on just a cookie sheet with foil, but I had cheap/thin cookie sheets because when I took it out of the oven, the pan began to cool and then it started to bend/adjust and I burned my hand badly when it shifted and the bacon grease spilled onto my hands.  So now, I actually take a cheap aluminum baking pan (about 9 x 13 or whatever you have) with deeper sides to it and I put this on the cookie sheet and place the bacon in it and then when/if my pan adjusts, it doesn't spill out and works really well."
486648,392356,2011-06-12,5,"I loved that I could make enough bacon for the whole family without having to stand over the frypan (while getting spattered). Simple, and the bacon was perfect."
407007,392356,2012-08-11,5,"Easy, perfect recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)"
42733943,392356,2014-07-04,5,"Much easier than cooking bacon on the stove ! I made 1/2 lb of bacon, drained the fat off half way through, left in for 15 minutes total. The bacon was perfect! Great recipe! There was a little splattering but MUCH less than when using the conventional method. My only regret is that I didn&#039;t try this technique sooner !  Thanks for posting !"
2574795,392356,2016-11-20,5,"If cooking more than 3 or 4 strips of bacon, using the oven is the best way to go. Be sure to use a sturdy cookie sheet or baking pan with deep sides. I usually use parchment baking paper. Not sure I'd suggest wax paper, but..? Ovens vary as does our doneness preference, but in my experience for regular thickness bacon 15-16 minutes is just about perfect. After removing the bacon, carefully set the cookie sheet in a cool place so the grease will solidify and you can neatly dispose or scoop some out for later use."
2001311462,392356,2016-12-21,0,"I didn't want to fix bacon on the cooktop so I decided to make it in the oven. After what was said about being burned using cookie sheets, I thought I'd fix the bacon in a glass 13x9 baking dish. Before going on, I should say that I had thick bacon and like it crisp. Taking both into consideration, I adjusted the baking time. It took about 28 mins. to bake the bacon in the glass dish to the crispness I desired and no burns."
2001990893,392356,2018-02-14,4,"Great method for simple spatter free bacon baking! Just be careful if you use a thin sliced bacon (like standard Oscar Meyer) lower the temp to about 350-375. On the other hand if you try this with thicker cut bacon, add a flip halfway through and 3-5 minutes to the time. With the thicker cut, also be more mindful of overcrowding as the extra grease can make for some soppy bacon."
2001479768,392356,2017-04-09,5,"I've been cooking my bacon in the oven for a few years now, and always line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil first for easy clean up. This morning, however, not only did I add some pepper to the bacon, but I also sprinkled some light brown sugar on top then rubbed it in before cooking. Oh my sweet bacon-y goodness!!! It was delicious! I will definitely do that again! P..S. I also flip my bacon half way through the cooking time - probably not necessary but works well for me."
2001505125,392356,2017-04-24,2,I cooked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and ended up with burnt bacon. So I would recommend checking it between 10-12 minutes.
2001540902,392356,2017-06-03,0,Nicole H. is right. I would recommend cooking it at 350. I turned it up to 400 and left for about 2 minutes and I almost had 6 charcoal strips. It was cooking and browning nicely at 350 before I turned it up to 400.
2000067660,392356,2017-06-10,5,Great way to cook bacon!! I have been doing it this way for about a year. I will most likely never go back to using a pan!!
2001589381,392356,2017-06-18,0,"I've tried sprinkling the bacon with brown sugar, and it's good, but even better is sprinkling a tiny bit of bourbon over the bacon before cooking it. Heaven!"
2001712676,392356,2017-09-13,0,Im personally not big on sweet meet so I usually use pepper and a roasted garlic and sea salt season
2001797933,392356,2017-11-15,0,"Turned out great. Also, very easy clean-up."
2001801473,392356,2017-11-21,5,It was awesome! Thanks for the help with the recipe...
2001896443,392356,2017-12-28,0,Am I supposed to preheat the oven before putting in the bacon or do I put it in at room temp? Turning the oven on after I have prepared seems a bit counterintuitive. Thanks!
2001922261,392356,2018-01-10,5,I've always made my bacon in the oven. I put it in my roaster on the rack and place it in a cold oven then set to 350f. Sometimes I sprinkle brown sugar and Cayanne pepper. Bill G. Bourbon sounds like an excellent idea!
2001047203,392356,2018-02-19,0,I've made this a number of times on a rack sitting in a half sheet . I always have to flip it to crisp both sides and never been able to fully cook bacon at this temp for less than 40 minutes.
2002024946,392356,2018-03-02,4,This recipe works best if the bacon is raised using a wire rack or something so that it's not sitting in its own grease. Cooks fast and is super crispy!
2002062272,392356,2018-03-19,5,"Followed to a tee minus doing two pans at once on a staggered timing. But crinkled the tin foil like others suggested, just be mindful of possibly needing to drain the grease mid way. Makes for a healthier treat! Even sent a plate to the downstairs neighbors (inlaws), easy way to be a rock star ;) Solid results, little mess, and 5 minutes of work. Stupid to do it any other way!!"
2002081449,392356,2018-03-28,1,"Bacon was burnt ash after 15 minutes. Some people like their bacon disgustingly incinerated like this, but I made an account to rate this down and inform anyone who enjoys bacon that isn't as hard as a kettle cooked chip THIS IS NOT THE RECIPE FOR YOU."
2002082692,392356,2018-03-29,5,"I cook my bacon in the oven all the time, just a little differently. For easy cleanup I line the cookie sheet with foil. I use a cookie cooking rack to keep the bacon out of the grease in the pan. The thickness of the bacon determines how long I keep it in the oven. Comes out perfect."
2001160057,392356,2018-06-15,5,"QUESTION - Do you put bacon in oven as its coming to temperature, or pre-heat before placing in oven? And who else is a proper southerner by saving all that tasty bacon grease? ??"
2002203921,392356,2018-07-01,5,"Turned out fantastic!!! I don't think I will ever fry bacon in a pan again! No smoky kitchen, easy cleanup, and cooked perfect."
2002215766,392356,2018-07-12,5,Tried and it was amazing! Took the advice of one of the comments and crinkled the tin foil before spreading out on sheet.
2001649879,392356,2018-08-16,5,I've been doing bacon in the oven for quite a while now. A great hint is to actually par-cook it in the microwave first using lots of paper towels to absorb the grease. This makes oven cooking quicker and FAR less grease spattering in your oven as well.
2002261634,392356,2018-08-30,0,"have done this too but an a cookie sheet with parchment paper and fork used to make holes. Grease drains into the sheet, we do about 15# at a time for a pancake breakfast, sausage the same, 100 per sheet"
2001604211,392356,2018-08-30,0,i prefer the microwave with many layers of paper towels under and one paper towel on top. it varies with every microwave. the best bacon i have had was on the grill but dont walk away for a second or it will be burned.
2002213989,392356,2018-09-04,5,"ive done this for years...always perfect! no constant watching/turning, no getting splattered by hot grease, no dirty stovetop. i use parchment paper instead of tin foil, since i always seem to have a ton of parchment. tried with turkey bacon (granddaughter prefers that-)...didnt fare well, so will stick to frying pan for that"
2002062813,392356,2018-10-13,0,"I line the pan with foil, add a wire cooling rack, place the bacon on the rack. Then I take a second nesting pan, put foil on the underside of the second pan, place it on the bacon then place a foil-wrapped brick in the second pan. Crispest bacon ever. Toss the wire rack into the dishwasher."
2002356295,392356,2018-12-04,0,I line the baking sheet with foil for easy clean up. I also lay a piece of parchment paper on top to prevent grease from possibly splattering in my oven.
2002179259,392356,2018-12-11,4,"I've cooked bacon this way for years. I line the sheet with foil and drain the grease into a jar to keep in the fridge. I do not put pepper on it. The only thing I think is important to note is that the bacon almost never SEEMS crispy until it is removed from the grease. I do by how the bacon LOOKS, not how it actually feels. Then I place it on paper towels after 8 remove it from the oven to get rid of some more of the grease and THEN it will be crispy."
136997,200964,2007-10-24,5,This is excellent! Very easy to assemble and the aroma while baking was fabulous. I used a 9x13 baking dish and baked 40 min. as suggested for a less gooey texture. Perfect. :)
181231,200964,2007-10-28,5,"This is simple,fast,pretty and tastes wonderful.I made in a 10x15 inch jelly roll pan.I used pears in mine,but will try apples next time."
873252,200964,2008-10-03,5,This is very easy and comes out tasting wonderful! Brought it to work and had many requests for the recipe. I used slightly less sugar over the top than called for and was perfect. Great easy fall recipe!
173579,200964,2009-03-25,5,This is a very good recipe. My family just loved it.  I will be making this again soon.  Thanks for posting.
13483,81808,2006-04-28,5,I'm surprised this has not been reviewed yet.  It really is a good dressing for my greens!!  I did find it a little too thick  but this was easily handled by adding some white wine.  Thanks for posting this Recipe Fairy.
1342006,71117,2011-09-28,0,"Very hearty and filling, depending on the size of the onion, a single one should be enough, and 425F in the oven seemed to do the trick for the baking time in the recipe.  The meatballs paired very well with http://www.food.com/recipe/bulgarian-lentil-soup-110844# and had a nice flavor to complement the soup.  I will definitely be making this again!"
2082695,471046,2012-01-02,0,"i grew on baked bean sammies, but we added bacon and topped with cheese and tossed under the broiler. Hmmm... I think I will have one for lunch!"
5060,39370,2002-11-24,5,"WOW!! Chris, made this for Dad and me for the Grey Cup game, Wonderfull stuff!! I cut the recipe in half, lots for the two of us, the two cheeses and onion are a great combination of flavours and the Hellmans made it wonderfully creamy, the Parmesan on top was nice and crispy around the edges. (I used Hellmans ultra low fat mayo.) We'll have to have some more of this over the Holidays! Very simple, easy to make, great tasting dip!!  Thanks for sharing."
169430,190261,2007-01-14,5,"WOW, these are delicious! I used anise seed that I crushed a bit and the flavor was fabulous. This is good enough for Thanksgiving or Christmas. The recipe works perfectly. I cut the preserves in half because I need to save on sugars and that provided a good sweetness and far less guilt. I think this recipe is a total winner."
58104,190261,2007-06-07,5,"Tasty! A nice hint of anise and sweetness from the carrots, red onions and preserves. I used 1 tablespoon of butter which was plenty!"
1197076,190261,2010-03-08,0,"Delicious ! I tweeked the recipe a bit>>substituted Smuckers SugarFree Apricot Preserves and added sliced (1/2"") pieces of celery to carrots in pot. We always like to have something ""green"" on our plates.
Thanks for the recipe, ""Parsley"""
424680,190261,2010-05-13,5,"What a great way to dress up the ol' carrot! Don't get me wrong ~ I enjoy eating them raw, but when it comes to company, they usually like to see them a little fancier, & this recipe does just that! Really loved the combo of anise & apricot & will definitely be making this recipe again & again! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Cookbook tag]"
