note: the addition of a slice of your favorite cheese melted over the top of your burgers can never hurt.

more notes: a good juicy burger can tend to make the bun soggy so it's a good idea to lightly toast the bun on the grill.

while very simplistic, the longer it cooks, the better it tastes, and showcases the lack of ingredients that could be found on a cattle drive,

i argue that as the drives passed settlements its logical that fresh killed beef was traded for services (laundry?) or fresh veggies, so that the legend of tasting better as time went on would reflect veggies added at a later date.

no refrigeration just constant heat in the chuckwagon.  chili cooks should all try this once!

marranitos -- or cochinos, or puerquitos, as are they are called in some mexican-american communities -- are often called ""gingerbread pigs,"" although they don't actually have ginger in them - and no cinnamon either.  in fact, traditional marranitos get their delicious spicy-brown goodness from molasses.


baking soda is the leavening agent, and it's the variation in the amount used that makes some bakeries' pigs fatter than others.


in mexico, bakers take piloncillos -- unrefined brown sugar pressed into small cone shapes -- and boil the sugar with just enough water to make their own molasses syrup, which is then added to the dough for the little pigs. then the dough is rolled out and cut with pig-shaped cookie cutters about the size of a medium-size grown-up's hand. (4.5"")


*this recipe is from fort worth baker marco rangel, and is used for the molasses pigs he sells at his bakery, the panaderia san marcos.  it uses the non-traditional addition of cinnamon.  you may wish to try also adding a bit of dry ground ginger.  and you may use a milk wash instead of an egg wash.","['brown sugar', 'vegetable shortening', 'baking soda', 'cinnamon', 'vanilla', 'unsulphured molasses', 'egg', 'milk', 'all-purpose flour']",9

why metal? it conducts heat better than glass or ceramic. why foil?  high heat can cook too well. loosely covering the top of the turkey will keep it from burning. why liquid? to catch the juices and fat as they drip from the turkey so that they will not burn from the high heat of the oven and stick on the bottom of the pan. you will be able to use this liquid as a base for your gravy. 5 rules for hht:
1) don't salt!!!!!!!! why suck the moisture out?

2)don't let the bird touch the pan! we want to roast, not stew.  when it sits on the bottom of the pan, instead of a rack, or it is squeezed into a too small pan, the hot air is unable to envelop the turkey, causing it to cook in it's own juices

3)don't baste the bird! it will break caramelization, slow down cooking and use up the pan juices

4) don't poke with a fork to turn or check the bird! piercing the meat will allow the flavorful meat juices to escape

5) don't cover the bird with cheesecloth! we don't care what martha says, covering the bird with cheesecloth will prevent browning. it will make a mighty tasting cheesecloth, though, if you are into that kinda thing!



 then spoon the stuffing in. what about stuffing? use chef marc's easy method: using oven mitts, place the turkey, cavity up, into a five-gallon plastic container from chef marc on kgo-am.","['whole turkey', 'olive oil', 'fresh black pepper', 'chicken broth']",4

add one cup chopped apples, raisins, or cranberries for a fruit stuffing, or add one cup of chopped walnuts or pecans. the variations are endless.
you may need to add a little more chicken broth, just enough to hold the stuffing balls together. use canned broth or dissolve a couple teaspoons soup base mix in warm water.
garnish chicken or pork dishes with the stuffing balls and grilled bacon rolls. to make the bacon rolls: cut bacon strips in half; roll them up and secure with a toothpick; and grill or fry until well done; drain on paper towels.","['butter', 'onion', 'celery', 'soft white bread cubes', 'fresh parsley', 'pepper', 'salt', 'poultry seasoning', 'egg', 'chicken broth']",10
