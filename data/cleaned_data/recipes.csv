while very simplistic, the longer it cooks, the better it tastes, and showcases the lack of ingredients that could be found on a cattle drive,

i argue that as the drives passed settlements its logical that fresh killed beef was traded for services (laundry?) or fresh veggies, so that the legend of tasting better as time went on would reflect veggies added at a later date.

no refrigeration just constant heat in the chuckwagon.  chili cooks should all try this once!

why metal? it conducts heat better than glass or ceramic. why foil?  high heat can cook too well. loosely covering the top of the turkey will keep it from burning. why liquid? to catch the juices and fat as they drip from the turkey so that they will not burn from the high heat of the oven and stick on the bottom of the pan. you will be able to use this liquid as a base for your gravy. 5 rules for hht:
1) don't salt!!!!!!!! why suck the moisture out?

2)don't let the bird touch the pan! we want to roast, not stew.  when it sits on the bottom of the pan, instead of a rack, or it is squeezed into a too small pan, the hot air is unable to envelop the turkey, causing it to cook in it's own juices

3)don't baste the bird! it will break caramelization, slow down cooking and use up the pan juices

4) don't poke with a fork to turn or check the bird! piercing the meat will allow the flavorful meat juices to escape

5) don't cover the bird with cheesecloth! we don't care what martha says, covering the bird with cheesecloth will prevent browning. it will make a mighty tasting cheesecloth, though, if you are into that kinda thing!



 then spoon the stuffing in. what about stuffing? use chef marc's easy method: using oven mitts, place the turkey, cavity up, into a five-gallon plastic container from chef marc on kgo-am.",1198.2

for an appetizer, make the stuffing balls smaller, reduce the baking time accordingly, and serve them with homemade or purchased cranberry relish for dipping.
if baking the stuffing balls with a meat dish, place stuffing balls in the oven for the final 30 minutes of cooking.
you can use other breads too. i usually use good quality homebaked-style plain white bread and stuffing bread when it is available. you can use up odds and ends of white bread, brown bread, rye bread, hot dog buns, and rolls for this recipe too.
adjust the seasonings to suit your tastes. 
add one cup chopped apples, raisins, or cranberries for a fruit stuffing, or add one cup of chopped walnuts or pecans. the variations are endless.
you may need to add a little more chicken broth, just enough to hold the stuffing balls together. use canned broth or dissolve a couple teaspoons soup base mix in warm water.
garnish chicken or pork dishes with the stuffing balls and grilled bacon rolls. to make the bacon rolls: cut bacon strips in half; roll them up and secure with a toothpick; and grill or fry until well done; drain on paper towels.",82.7
